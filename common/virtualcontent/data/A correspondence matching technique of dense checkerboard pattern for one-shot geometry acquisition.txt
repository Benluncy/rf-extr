 A Correspondence Matching Technique of Dense Checkerboard Pattern for One-shot Geometry Acquisition 
Vinh Ninh Dao Masanori Sugimoto The UniversityofTokyo* Abstract This paper presents a correspondence 
matching technique for a dense checkerboard pattern displayed by a projector camera sys­tem for one-shot 
geometry acquisition purposes. It does not require color coding or complicated spatial encoding techniques 
to encode the corresponding positions of corners, and can .nd corresponding positions for an incomplete 
checkerboard pattern. We introduce a combination of epipolar geometry and topology constraints in the 
checkerboard pattern to solve correspondence ambiguities. To ver­ify the feasibility of the technique, 
we have created a prototype scanning system that can construct the 3D geometry of a scenario for each 
image frame. The results of our experiments show that the technique can identify correspondences for 
a checkerboard pattern displayed on discontinuous surfaces and can reconstruct 3D geom­etry structures 
in real time. 1 Introduction Noncontact 3D geometry acquisition techniques that use structured light 
are important techniques in visual sensing. The development of3D geometry acquisition techniquesin thegame 
industry andin daily life requires that these techniques befaster and more robust in dynamic conditions. 
One-shot geometry acquisition techniques that use spatially encoded patterns are suited to capturing 
dynamic objectsbut are not robustagainst surface distortion[Vuylsteke and Oosterlinck 1990]. Other techniques 
use color in various ways to encode positional information, thereby being sensitive to sur­face colors 
in a dynamic-capture environment. Recently, Furukawa et al. and Ulusoy et al. proposed using a grid pattern 
for one­shot geometry reconstruction. However, their methods are time­consuming [Furukawa et al. 2008] 
and do not guarantee a unique convergence of the evaluation function for a dense pattern [Ali Os­man 
Ulusoy2009]. Alternatively, checkerboard corners are highly distinguishable featuresthatcanbe detectedrobustlyundervariable 
conditions. However, the corresponding corners cannot be found individually if the pattern is dense and 
incomplete (Figure 1). Our approach to solving the correspondence problem for a dense checkerboard pattern 
is to use a combination of epipolar geometry and topology constraints in the checkerboard pattern. This 
method can guarantee unique convergence of the correspondence matching results. Initially, a checkerboard 
pattern displayed by a projector camera system is robustly analyzed as groups of connected corners and 
edges in real time using our proposed technique [Dao and Sug­imoto 2010]. The checkerboard corners are 
then classi.ed into P+ and P categories and the edges are classi.ed into H+, H , V+, and V categories 
based on their horizontal and vertical directions. The constraints between the corners and the edges 
are used to elimi­nate noise and to index the corners in a group into a consistent 2D indexing order. 
 2 Correspondence Matching The aim of this process is to .nd the true corresponding posi­tion from several 
possible candidate matching positions decidedby *e-mail:{dao,sugi}@itl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp Figure 1: Ambiguity

ambiguity and its disambiguity using neighboring corners. epipolar geometry. In Figure 2(a), a corner 
P ' detected in a camera image may have several candidate corresponding positions along its corresponding 
epipolar line lP (Figure 2(b)), which is de.ned by Eq. 1. lP = FP ' (1) Here, F is a fundamental matrix 
of the rigidly attached projector camera system. The candidate corresponding positions for a point P 
' are limited to the corners belonging to the same category {P1,P2,P3,...} (highlighted by yellow circles). 
The correspond­ing positions for a group of 3 × 3 corners in a camera image (Figure 2(a)) are the groups 
of corners in the green areas (Fig­ure 2(b)). To identify the unique corresponding position for a point 
P ', we investigate the corresponding positions of a neigh­boring corner N ' in the group (Figure 2(a)). 
Because the relative positions of the corners in a group are preserved during a projec­tive transformation, 
the candidate corresponding positions for N ' (called {N1,N2,Nn,...})must be among the neighboring corners 
of the points {P1,P2,Pn,...} (shown in Figure 2(b) and high­lighted by yellow circles). These neighboring 
corners will be on a line parallel to the epipolar line lP because of the grid structure. The epipolar 
line lN corresponding to the feature point N ' will go through its true corresponding corner N , and 
will not go through other neighboring points (assuming that the epipolar point on the projection image 
is not at in.nity, a condition that is easily satis­.ed). Bytaking the Euclidean distance from the neighboring 
points {N1,N2,Nn,...} to the corresponding neighboring epipolar line lN as an evaluation function, the 
value of this evaluation function will converge to a minimum at the true corresponding position. Copyright

978-1-4503-0439-9/10/0012 To increase the robustness of this process, we can repeat the pro­cess for 
the other points in the same group, and use the sum of cor­responding distances to identify the unique 
corresponding position (Eq. 2). . j arg min d(Nij ,lNi ) (2) j i Here, each j identi.es a candidate corresponding 
position decided by epipolar geometry for the origin point of a group, Nij are the corresponding neighboring 
points for the group at each candidate s corresponding position, and lNi are the corresponding epipolar 
lines for each of Nij . The convergence speed of the evaluation function depends on the density and the 
accuracyof the corner de­tection and system calibration processes.For checkerboard patterns of similar 
density, larger groupsof corners will convergefaster. 3 Implementation In our implementation, a camera 
(QCAM-200V) and a Mitsubishi projector (DLP-PK20) are rigidly attached to form a handheld projector camera 
system. The density of the checkerboard pattern isup to 60 × 40,andtheaverage distance between cornersis5pix­els. 
The checkerboard pattern detection process takes most of the processing time, with the correspondence 
matching process taking very little processing time. The checkerboard analysis process can acquire 3D 
frame geometries at 30 fps when the system is imple­mented on an Nvidia GTX9700 GPU. To verify the convergence 
of the correspondence matching process, we compared the value of theevaluation functionbymatchingacornerandagroupof 
corners. Figure3shows the corresponding distance fora single corner. The true corresponding point is 
circled in blue,but the ambiguity (two points with red circles) could not be resolved because of noise. 
By measuringthe corresponding distanceforagroupof 5×5 connected corners, noise is suppressed and the 
ambiguity of correspondence canbe resolved,asshowninFigure4.The3D geometriesofahand andof discontinuous

In this paper, we have proposed a combination of epipolar geome­try and topology constraints for a black/white 
checkerboard pattern to solve correspondence ambiguity for an incomplete checkerboard patterninrealtime.Viaexperiment,wehavecon.rmedthatadense 
checkerboard pattern can be used as a structured light pattern for one-shot geometry acquisition techniques. 
However, the density of the reconstructed geometry is still sparse and the data are of low accuracy.Weaimto
