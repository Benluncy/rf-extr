seen an increase in the use of computer simulation for analysis of manufactur- ing systems. With this 
growth has come the rea~ ization that the typical methods of displaying simulation output -a printed 
trace of the events occurring over time or a statistical summary -are often inadequate. Simulation users 
and language designers are beginning to explore the potential of computer graphics in model verification, 
analysis, and presentation of simulation results. This use of graphics may be application-oriented or 
general purpose. The application-oriented approach typically involves building a pictorial model of the 
system of interest, and mapping the simulated output into this representation. The general purpose approaches 
include animating the flow of enti- ties through a network model, as is done in IDEF 2 (Pritsker) and 
generating histograms, pie charts, graphs, etc., as is done in many lan- guages including SIMAN (Pegden) 
and IDEF 2. The application-oriented approach can provide a very realistic animation which is easily 
under- stood. For example, material handling devices can be shown moving parts on the shop floor. However, 
there are disadvantages to building such a graphical model. A great deal of pro- gramming effort is required 
and typically the model is applicable to one system or a class of closely related systems. Sophisticated 
graphics hardware or software may be needed for display of the simulated system. In contrast, the general 
purpose system usually displays a static summary of results rather than an animation showing change over 
time. Where animation is used sophisticated hardware or sof~ ware may again be required, and the representa- 
tion of the system may be much less familiar to an audience. This paper describes a general purpose 
animation package for displaying simulated output which can be run on a variety of hardware, including 
a standard CRT terminal with a graphics character set such as the DEC VTIO0. The package is an outgrowth 
of research in capacity planning and shop floor control. The original intent was to display work in 
process as it changed over time to evaluate order release and scheduling method- ologies. However, 
the package can also be used to display discrete-change variables for many types of simulation models. 
 2. ANIMATION OF OUTPUT 2.1 Description of the Model The objective in constructing the animation pack- 
age was to provide a general purpose representa- tion of the state of a simulated system over time which 
would allow rapid determination of system capacity and utilization. In addition, it was desired to simplify 
the process of creation and modification of graphical models. Because of these considerations, the number 
of entities in a subsection of the model (queue, conveyor, transporter, resource, etc.) is repre- sented 
as the height of a bargraph. The user defines, labels, and locates the bars and speci- fies a minimum 
and maximum number of entities for each. Figure 1 shows a small model with two queues and two machine 
types: drills (quantity one) and lathes (quantity two). The queue be- havior will be observed between 
the limits of 0 and 5 entities and 5 and 50 entities for queues 1 and 2, respectively. Machine utilization

 GROUP TE~OGY 2~s ISO 2 I la ~ LATHE Figure i: Model Setup Results of a simulation analysis of this 
system are depicted by filling the bars to the approp- riate levels The animation is performed as a series 
of discrete time steps; the status of the system at the end of each step is displayed. Length of the 
time step is determined by the modeler. Figure 2 shows the state of the system during one step of simulated 
time. All machines are busy, 1 job is waiting for the drill, and more than 25 for the lathes. The symbol 
above the bar representing queue 2 indicates that the specified maximum display quantity for that queue 
has been .exceeded. ,-~OPTECHt~L~Y C~-q-L S~  2 2~  I OC  OLE2 LATHE Figure 2: System Status Display 
 2.2 Data Requirements A file of information is required for each type of data (queue, resource, etc.) 
that is to be animated At each change of status, the simula- ted time and the new status (number of entities 
or value of a variable) must be recorded This information is then replayed by the animation model. The 
model presently is used for simulations built in the SIMAN language Using SIMAN, the required files can 
be generated merely by speci- fying a field on an input card. However, the animation can be used with 
other simulation languages which provide the facility to generate such data files, or which allow user-coded 
program inserts for these purposes  2.3 Animation Model Creation Although creation and placement of 
the bars is a simple process, it rapidly becomes tedious if repeated viewing of a model under different 
experimental conditions is required. Therefore, the animation package includes options to:  create 
a model  save a model  retrieve a model  change a model  The user can create a library of models 
which can be recalled, updated, and saved as desired For each model the information saved includes its 
 title, the number of bars, the time step, and each bar's label, placement and minimum and maximum range. 
 3. EXAMPLE A model of a small job shop was constructed using SIMAI~. The shop contains five machine 
groups with one to three similar machines in each group Work in process is held at the machine group 
for the next operation and is not assigned to a par- ticular machine in that group until the machine 
becomes available and the job begins its pro- cessing. Using SIMAN, the status of the system and statis- 
tics on system performance were collected for 3375 simulated time units Part of the statis- tical summary 
is contained in Figure 3. Machine groups 1 and 5 had very high utilization and correspondingly longer 
queues. Standard devia- tions on queue size are large, suggesting that queue lengths fluctuate considerably. 
It is not obvious from this summary if the fluctuation is cyclic or if it results from a growth in the 
amount of work in process. Further, the change in the number of waiting jobs for the entire shop over 
time cannot be determined from this information. For example, one queue might in- crease while another 
is depleted or both might increase simultaneously depending upon the job mix and the order release policy 
in effect An animation of the data (Figure 4) reveals the time-varying behavior of the shop. In this 
fig- ure, the queues are drawn above their respective machine groups; the six pictures represent different 
time periods for the simulated shop. It is readily apparent from this figure that the amount of work 
in process is increasing as time passes Queues 3 and 4 seem to be relatively stable, while the others 
tend to increase over time. This suggests that the order release strategy should be modified to favor 
those orders requiring substantial processing by machine groups 3 and 4, and to delay orders which would 
further increase congestion in the remaining machining areas. The effectiveness of such a modification 
could also be evaluated using the animation model.  Animation of Output DISCRETE CIIA:;CE VAltIAi~l.ES

paper is useful in obtaining an overview of fluctuations in work in process in a simulated shop for 
 capacity analysis purposes. In addition, it can be used for a wide variety of simulation models to 
display any variable which changes in dis- crete steps over time. A limitation of this approach is 
that it pro- vides an overall series of snapshots of the system, but no detail on the individual elements. 
It is impossible to ascertain, for example, which jobs are currently in the work center queues. Thus, 
the package is not suitable for applications such as interactive scheduling, which require such information. 
 A planned addition to the package is the capabil- ity to stop the simulation, change certain para- 
 meters associated with the model, (queue prior- ity, for example) and then continue running the model, 
but under the new conditions. This fea- ture would require a close link between the output animation 
package and the simulation language used for modeling and thus would have a more limited application 
than the package as described in this paper. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors wish to thank C. Dennis Pegden
