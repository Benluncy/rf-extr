 EFFICIENT FAULT TOLERANT ROUTINGS IN NETWORKS Andrei Broder IBM Research San Jose, California 95 1933 
 Michael Fischer Yalc University New Haven, Connecticut 06520 ABSTRACT: We analyze the problem of constructing 
a net-work which will have a fixed routing and which will be high- ly fault tolerant. A construction 
is presented which forms a "product route graph" from two or more constituent "route graphs." The analysis 
involves the surviving route graph, which consists of all non-faulty nodes in the network with two nodes 
being connected by a directed edge iff the route from the first to the second is still intact after a 
set of component failures. The diameter of the surviving route graph, that is, the maximum distance between 
any pair of nodes, is a meas-ure of the worst-case performance degradation caused by the faults. The 
number of faults tolerated, the diameter, and the degree of the product graph are related in a simple 
way to the corresponding parameters of the constituent graphs. In addi- tion, there is a "padding theorem" 
which allows one to add nodes to a graph and to extend a previous routing. 1. Introduction. We consider 
the problem of constructing a "fault- tolerant" routing in a network with an arbitrary number of nodes. 
This work is motivated by a practical problem of message routing in a communications network. A route 
is a path from one node to another. The message delivery system must find a route along which to send 
each message to its destination. If the route is known beforehand, then it can be attached to the message, 
allowing intermediate nodes to send the message on using only information contained in the mes- sage 
itself. Such a simple forwarding function can be built into fast special-purpose hardware, yielding the 
desired high overall network performance. The problem is greatly simplified if one chooses a route in 
advance for each source/destination pair and uses that "i~iais work was supported in part by the Office

for all messages from the one node to the other. Such a choice of routes is called a routing table. If 
the routing table is computed only once for a given network configuration, considerable effort can be 
put into its computation. Even this effort, however, must be kept within reasonable bounds since the 
routing table must be recomputed when the network configuration changes. All routes in a routing table 
are cus-tomarily simple paths and in addition might have other desir- able properties such as being minimal 
length and approxi-mately evenly distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we are particularly 
concerned with the fault-tolerant properties of fixed routings. Namely, when a node or link fails, all 
of the routes which go through the failed component become unusable, leaving certain pairs of nodes unable 
to communicate in the normal way. However, assuming the network remains connected, communication is still 
possible by sending a message along a sequence of surviv- ing routes. We analyze the surviving route 
graph, which con- . sists of all non-faulty nodes in the network with two nodes being connected by a 
directed edge iff the route from the first to the second is still intact after a set of component failures. 
Then the dialneter of the surviving route graph, that is, the maximum distance between any pair of nodes, 
is a measure of the worst-ease performance degradation caused by the faults. There are several reasons 
for continuing to use old rout- ing tables even after a fault has occurred. One significant reason is 
that nodes must communicate in order to compute the new routing table, so some kind of interim communication 
mechanism is essential. Moreover, one node can broadcast to all others without knowing which routes are 
still intact --it simply "floods" the network by sending its message together with a "route counter" 
along all of its routes; any node re-ceiving the message increments the route counter and reb- roadcasts 
it along all of its routes if the route counter does not exceed the bound on the diameter of the graph. 
This type of flooding done on route graphs frequently results in fewer 536 messages than when done along 
the edges. In addition, for certain types of fault tolerant protocols, such as those used in Byzantine 
Agreement, a node at the endpoint of a route must do considerably more processing of messages than one 
which is an interior point of a route. Consequently, the time it takes for a message to reach all other 
nodes is proportional to the diameter of the surviving route graph. A further application for this model 
is the case of a net- work that reconfigures itself according to some shortest path strategy at certain 
(relatively rare) intervals. If one wishes to run a protocol on such a network in which it is assumed 
that messages between two nodes are always delivered so long as neither of the nodes is either down or 
disconnected, then the message can be sent over the routes of the surviving route graph. As mentioned 
above, if one assumes more extensive processing at nodes which are the endpoints of rou.tes, then the 
maximum delivery time for a message is lbroportional to the diameter of the surviving route graph. The 
length of the diameter of the surviving route graph is utilized in a clock synchronization algorithm 
[HSS] which has been developed for an arbitrary network that might contain faults. The al- gorithm has 
already been implemented in the Highly Availa- ble Systems Project currently under development at IBM. 
This problem was introduced by Dolev, et al. [DHSS83 ]. In it, they establish properties of routings 
in general net- works. They also give a routing for a specific network (a t-dimensional hypercube) which 
can tolerate up to t-1 faults and still have a surviving graph of diameter at most 2. In terms of N, 
the number of nodes in the graph, their construc- tion tolerates up to t = Iog2N -1 faults and can be 
applied whenever N is a power of two. Also, the degree of each node ist+ 1. In this paper, we look at 
the problem of finding good routings for networks where the number of nodes is not a power of two. We 
have a general construction which allows one to form a "product route graph" from two or more con-stituent 
route graphs. The tolerance, diameter, and degree of the product graph are related in a simple way to 
the corre-sponding parameters of the constituent graphs, although the construction of the routing on 
the product graph is definitely non-trivial. Applying this construction repeatedly to simple 2-node graphs 
yields the cube result of Dolev et al. However, other cardinality graphs can be obtained by starting 
with a different basis. In addition, we have a "padding theorem" which allows us to add nodes to a graph 
and extend a previ- ous routing. As an example, using the 2-node, 3-node, and 5-node starting graphs 
of figure l, one can construct a routed graph of any cardinality N of the form 2i3J5 k. The resulting 
graph will tolerate i+2j+2k-I faults, have degree i+2j+2k, and have surviving diameter of 2. Alternatively, 
if the complete graph on 5 nodes is substituted for the 5°cycle, the resulting graph will tolerate i+2j+4k-I 
faults, have degree i+2j+4k, and have surviving diameter of 2. Note that in both eases the fault tolerance 
is optimal in that any larger group of faults might disconnect the'network. Figure 1: potential building 
blocks. In addition to providing a constructive technique for building networks and providing them with 
fault-tolerant routings, our approach provides the network designer with a powerful tool. As the above 
example illustrates, s/he can use sparse or dense "basic" graphs in constructing the product graph according 
as s/he is interested in minimizing the num-ber of links or maximizing the fault-tolerance. 2. Graph 
Routing A network is modeled as an undirected graph G=(V,E), with nodes representing processors and edges 
representing communication links. We do not allow self-loops or parallel edges. A routing assigns to 
any pair of nodes in the network a fixed path between them. All communications between these nodes will 
travel along this path. When speaking of a path between x and y in G, we use the notation ~G(x,y). A 
mini-mal length routing is one that always gives a path of minimal length. More formally, define PathG(x,y) 
to be the set of simple paths between the nodes x and y in G and Path(G) to be the set of all simple 
paths in G. A routing is a partial function p:VxV --> Path(G) such that p(x,y) ¢ Path(x,y). (If Patho(x,y 
) = 0, then p(x,y) is undefined). We call p(x,y) the route from x to y. A shortest path routing is a 
routing p such that for every pair (x,y), p(x,y) is a shortest path be-tween x and y. A routing p induces 
the route graph R(G,p) -- (V, Dora(p)), where Dora(p) is the domain of definition of p. If # is defined 
for every pair x,y for x#y, then R(G,p) is the complete graph on IV[ nodes. We shall abbreviate R(G,p) 
as R and nG(x,y) as ~(x,y) whenever such an abbreviation is unambiguous. 537 Let p(x,y)p(y,z) be the 
route from x to y followed by the route from y to z. The function p can be extended to a func- tion on 
V" in an obvious way: p(xl,X2,X3,...) m p(xt,x2)p(x2,x3) .... In particular, given a path ~(xl,x k) = 
xtx2...x k, then g(~(xt,xk)) = p(xl,x2)p(x2,x3)...V(Xk.t,Xk). Let Vp(x,y ) be the set of nodes in p(x,y). 
A routing is consistent if for all x,y such that p(x,y) is defined and for all z such that z c V~(x,y 
), p(x,y) = p(x,z)p(z,y). Afaultin Gis either a r~ode or anedgein G. A route is affected by a fault if 
the fault is contained in it. Note that one fault may affect several routes. Given a set F of faults 
in G, we define the fault free routing p/F to be the reduction of p to fault free routes. As above, the 
fault free routing p/F induces the surviving route graph R(G,p)/F = (V/F, dora(p/F)), where V/F consists 
of all non-faulty noses in G. We use the notation R/F for R(G,p)/F where it is unambigu- ous. A (shortest 
path) routing p is called (d,f)-tolerant if for every set F of f faults in G, R(G,p)/F has diameter at 
most d. A graph G is called (d,f)-tolerant if there exists a shortest path routing p on G that is (d,f)-tolerant. 
Note that if G is (d,f)-tolerant, then the degree of any node in G is at least  f+l. Lemma 1. If p is 
consistent, then for every set F of faults in G, p/F is consistent. Proof. Immediate. [] Lemma 2. If 
G is (d,f)-tolerant and f>0, then d> 1. Proof. Let F=(x,y) for some edge (x,y) in G. Since p(x,y)=(x,y) 
for anyshortest path routing p, d>2. [] Lemma 3. Let p be a consistent routing of G and Ict x,y be any 
pair of nodes in G. Let F be a set of faults such that p(x,y) contains a fault but there is a path ~-g/F(x,y) 
from x to y in R/F which does not contain any faults. Then there exists a node on ~'R/F(x,y) which is 
not on p(x,y). Proof. Let Vn(x,y ) be the set of nodes in ng/F(x,y) and assume to the contrary that 
V,,(x,y ) c_ Vp(x.y). Let p(x,y) = X0Xl..,Xk, where Xo=X and xk=y , and let srg/F(X,y)=x'0x'l...X'rn, 
where x'0=x and X'm=y. Lct I be the largest number less than k such that the edge (Xl,Xl+l) E F, and 
let J be the largest number less than m such that x'.l = x i for some i < I. Then x'.lxi+txi+2...x'j+ 
l is a route by the consistency assumption with respect to p(x,y), and by con-struction it contains a 
fault. This contradicts the assumption that p(~g/F(x,y)) is fault-free. [] Lemma 4. Let p be a (d,f)-tolerant 
consistent routing with f>0, and x,y a pair of distinct nodes in G. For every set F of faults with I 
FI < f, there exists a path ¢rg/F(x,y ) of length at most d such that p(~g/F(x,y)) is fault free and 
Wg/F(x,y) contains a node that is not on p(x,y). Proof. Let F' be the set of faults F together with an 
edge from p(x,y). F' contains at most f faults, so by definition there exists a path ~K/F'(X,Y) from 
x to y such that p(~R./F,(x,y)) does not contain any faults in F'. By Lemma 3, eK/F'(X,Y) contains a 
node that is not on p(x,y). [] 3. Product of routings. Given two graphs G = (V G, EG) and H = (V H, t/H), 
their cartesian product G xH is a graph (V, E), where V = VGxV H and ((i,j),(k,l)) ~ E iff both (i,j) 
and (k,l) are nodes in V and either i=k and (j,I) ~ El! or j=l and (i,k) E E G. The H plane defined by 
i (G plane defined by j) in GxH is the sub- graph of G xH determined by all nodes hav, ing the first 
(second) coordinate equal to i (j). We use the notation H i and Gj for the H plane defined by i and the 
G plane defined by j. Isomorphic graphs being considered equal, it can be shown that the cartesian product 
of graphs is commutative, and that any graph can be uniquely decomposed into a carte- sian product of 
indecomposible graphs. For details see [Sa ]. Let PG and PH be given routings for G and H, and let x=(i,j) 
and y=(k,I). We define the product routing pGxPH as follows, pG×PH(X,y) = PH(X,Z)pG(z,y), where z=(i,I). 
In other words, the route is obtained by concatenating the route PH(X,g) of H i with the route pG(z,y) 
of G 1. Clearly, if i=k or j=l, then one of these routes is the null route. In this case, we say that 
x and y are coplanar. The routing PGXPH is a consistent routing iff both PG and PH are consistent. From 
now on we shall denote PGXPH by PGXH, although of course other routings are possible. Let x = (i,j) and 
y = (i',j') be two nodes that are not coplanar in GxH, and let F be the set of faults in GxH. We associate 
to x and y a copy of G, called G(x,y), with the set of faults FG(x,y). FG(x,y) is defined as follows: 
a) if the edge (l~,l)cE G, then (k,l) E FG(x,y) if either the edge between (k,j) and (I,j) or the edge 
between (k,j') and (I,j') is faulty (in G x H). b) if keV G and k#pG(i,i'), then kcFG(x,y) if pH((k,j),(k,j')) 
is faulty. c) if kcV G, kePG(i,i'), and k#i,i', then keFG(X,y) if either of the nodes (k,j) or (k,j') 
is faulty.  538 H(x,y) and FH(X, M are similarly defined. Note that the nodes j, j' in H(x,y) and i, 
i' in G(x,y) are always nonfaulty. Lemma 5. Any fault in F determines a fault in at most one of FG(x,y) 
and Fil(x,y): Proof. Let x=(i,j) and y=(i',j'). Suppose that there is an edge fault fl = ((I,k),(l'.k)) 
c F. If ft determines an edge fault (I,l')cE G, then it must satisfy condition a) and, there-fore, either 
k=j or k=j'. Suppose by contradiction that fl also determines a node fault. Since kcVtt, fl can determine 
a node fault only in Flt(x,y). For condition b) to hold, kePH(j,j'), which is clearly impossible, since 
either k=j or k=j'. If condition c) holds, then k#j,j', also impossible. Suppose that fl does not determine 
an edge fault in E G, i.e. condition a) does not hold. Then kej,j'. Note that at most one of conditions 
b) and c) can hold, and therefore fl can determine at most one fault. (The proof for edge faults of the 
form ((I,k),(I,k') is similar). Now suppose that there is a node fault f2 = (k,l) ¢ F. By definition, 
a node fault in G x H cannot determine an edge fault in FG(x,y) or FH(X,y ). Suppose that f2 determines 
a node fault in FG(X,y). If condition b) holds, then k~PG(i,i' ) and pH((k,j),(k,j')) is faulty. In particular, 
(k,l) ¢ ptl((k,j),{k,j')). If [2 also determines a node fault in FH(X~y), then it must do so by condition 
c) (since IePH(j,j')). But for condition c) to hold, I#j,j' and one of the nodes 0,1) or (i,l') is faulty. 
This implies that k=i or k=i ~, which contradicts the assumption that k#PG(i,i') (i.e. the assumption 
of condi- tion b) by which f2 determines a fault in FG(X,y)). Finally, suppose that f2 determines a node 
fault in FG(X,y) under condition c). Therefore, kePG(X,y), k~i,i', and one of the nodes (k,j) or (k,j') 
is faulty. This implies that l=j or l=j'. If f2 determines a node fault in FH(X,y), then since I=j or 
l=j', condition c) cannot hold. For condi- tion b) to hold, lePH(j,j'). Since l=j or l=j', this is clearly 
impossible. [] Corollary. [FG(X,Y) I + IFH(X.y)[ _< [F[. Lemma 6. Assume PG is (dG,fG)-tolerant, PH is 
(dH,ft0-tolerant, at least one of fG and fH is greater than 0, and both are consistent routings. Let 
x,y be two nodes in GxH that are not coplanar. Then for every set F of faults such that Fo(x,y) (resp. 
Fll(X,y)) contains fewer than fo (resp. fH) faults, the distance between x and y in R(GxH,PGXH)/F is 
at most d o (resp. dH). Proof. Let x=(i,j) and y=(i',j'). Without loss of generality, assume that fG>0 
and that FG(X,y ) contains f<fG faults. By lemma 2, dG>2. By lemma 4 there exists a path ~, of length 
< d o in R(G,PG)/FG(X,y ) from i to i' such that pG(~') is fault-free and ~ contains a node which is 
not on PG(i,i'). We first show a fault-free path in OxH from x to y and then prove that its length in 
R(GxH,PGXH)/F is bounded by d o . Let k be a node on ~ that is not on PG(i,i') and let I be the node 
on ~ immediately after k (i.e. (k,l) is an edge in R(G,PG)/FG(X,y)). Denote ~r=~l(k,l)~ 2. Note that 
k#i' but that l might equal i', in which case ~2=@. By the definition of FG(X,y), since pG(Tr) had no 
faults in FG(x,y), pG(Crl) is fault free in the Gj. Similarly, both pG(k,l) and pG(~r2) are fault-free 
in the Gj,. By condition b) of the definition of FG(X,y), pH((k,j),(k,j')) is fault-free (i.e. pH((k,j),(k,j')) 
con-tains no fault from F). Therefore, the path in G x H composed of the corresponding pG(Wl)plt((k,j),(k,j'))pG((k,j'),(l,j'))pG 
(~r2) is fault-free. But from the definition of the routing in G x H, it follows that pH((k,j),(k,j'))pG((k,j'),(I,j')) 
form just one route. Hence, this path is of length at most d G in R(Gx H,PGXH)/F. The proof for FH(x,y) 
is similar. The only difference is that we have to take 1 to be the node immediately preceding k in *r 
to get a path of length d H in R(GxH,PGXH)/F. [] Theorem !. Let G be (do,fG)-tolerant and H be (dH,fH)-tolerant 
with" consistent (dG,fG)- and (dll,fH)-tolerant routings PG and PH respectively. Then the graph GxH is 
(max[dG,dH,2}, fG+fH+ l)-tolerant. Proof. Let PGXH = PGXPH We will show that PGXH is (max{d G,dH,2I,fG 
+fH +l)-t°lerant. It suffices to show that for any pair of nodes x=(i,j) and y=(i',j') and every fG+fH+l 
faults in the product graph, there exists a path of length bounded by max[do,dH,2 } from x to y in the 
graph R(GxH,PGXH)/F. The proof is by cases. Case 1: i=i'. Case 1.1: H i contains fH or fewer faults. 
We are done because H i itself is (dH,fll)-tolerant. Case 1.2: H i contains at least fH+l faults. Both 
node x and node y have at least fG+l corresponding adjacent nodes in their respective G planes. Each 
pair of corre- sponding adjacent nodes has a route joining them in an H plane. These planes are both 
mutually distinct and also different from H i . Therefore, these adjacent nodes define at least fG+ 1 
node disjoint paths, each utilizing a different 539 H plane, connecting x and y. Since we have at most 
fG faults among these node disjoint paths, at least one of them is fault-free. Each of these fG+l disjoint 
paths is composed of exactly two routes in PGXH. The first route consists of the edge from x to the H 
plane and the second consists of the path in that H plane followed by the edge to y. Therefore, each 
one is of length 2 in RGxH/F. Case 2: j=j'. The proof is similar to case 1. Case 3: i~i t and j#j'. The 
remainder of the proof is an analysis of G(x,y) and H(x,y). Case 3.1: Either ]Fo(x,y) l<fG or IFH(x,y) 
l<fH. Then the result follows from lemma 6. Case 3.2: Both [FG(x,y ) I =fG and IFH(X,Y) I =fa" If either 
PG(i,i') or pH(j,j ~) contains a fault, then the result follows from techniques similar to those of lemma 
6. So suppose that both pG(i,i') and Ptt(J,J') are fault-free in G(x,)') and H(x,y) respectively. By 
lemma 5 there can be at most one fault in G×H which has not determined a fault in either FG(x,y ) or 
FH(X,y ). If this fault is not in either p((i,j),(i,j')) or p((i,j'),(i',j')), then the route from x 
to y is fault-free, and the distance from x to y in GxH is one. If there is a fault in either of the 
above routes, then by the definition of FG(X,y ) and FH(x,y), it must be the point (i,j'). Therefore, 
the point (i',j) must be fault-free and a path of length two from x to y in RGXH/FGX H can be obtained 
by concatenating PG(i,i') in Gj with PH(J,J') in Hi,. Case 3.3: Either I FG(X,y )l=fo and [Ftl(x,y )l=fH+l 
or [ FG(x,Y) I :fG+ 1 and [ FH(x,Y) [ =fH" Assume [FG(X,Y) I=fG and IFH(x,y )l=flt+l. If PG(i,i') has 
a fault, the proof follows using previous techniques. So suppose that PG(i,i') is fault-free. If PH(J,J') 
is fault free in H i, then p((i,j),(i,j'))p((i,j'),(i',j')) is a path of length one. If PH(J,J') is fault 
free in Hi, , then p((i,j),(i',j))p((i',j),(i',j')) is a path of length two. So sup- pose that PH(J,J') 
contains a fault in both H i and Hi,. Since both H planes contain at least one fault, neither contains 
more than fH faults. Therefore, we can travel from (i,j) to (i,j') in H i along a path of length no greater 
than d H. If p((i,j')(i',j')) is concatenated to this path, the length of the path is not increased. 
The proof is similar if instead we haveFG(X,y):fG+l and [FH(X,y) l=f H. 4. Padding Graphs. IV J +(]V[/~2), 
G can be extended to a graph G'=(V',E') and a routing p' such that G' is (d,f)-tolerant, I V' ] =N, and 
the maximum degree in G' is no more than ~+ 1. Proof. We extend G to a graph G':(V',E') with IV' ] :N 
as follows. Let M=N--]V[. Match one of the new nodes, say x, to a node in the original network, say x', 
and connect x to all of x's neighbors in G. Next, choose another new node, say y, and match it to a node 
in the original network, say y', which has no neighbors in common with x' in G. Connect y to all the 
neighbors of y'. This procedure can be repeated so long as there exist nodes in G which are neither matched 
to a new node nor have neighbors in common with an already matched node. Note that each iteration eliminates 
at most /u 2 nodes from G, since both x' and each of its neighbors have degree at most ~. Let p be a 
routing in G which is (d,f)-tolerant. We ex- tend p to p' as follows. For x,y ¢ V, p'(x,y)=p(x,y). For 
x c V'--V and y E V, let x' be the node in V to which x is matched. If y is a neighbor of x', then p'(x,y)=(x,y). 
If y is not a neighbor of x', then let w be the neighbor of x' which lies on p(x',y). We define p'(x,y) 
to be the same as p(x',y) with the edge (x',w) replaced by the edge (x,w). p'(y,x) is similarly defined 
to be p(y,x') with its last edge (w,x') re-placed by the edge (w,x). For x,y c V'--V, let x' and y' be 
the nodes in V to which x and y are matched, and let w and v be the neighbors of x r and y' respectively 
which lie on p(x',y'). Note that by construction, w#v. Then, p'(x,y) is the same as p(x',y') with the 
edge (x',w) replaced by (x,w) and (v,y') replaced by (v,y). The consistency of p' follows trivially from 
the consisten- cy of p. Since G tolerates f faults and since all new nodes are connected to at least 
f+f distinct nodes in G, it is easy to show that G' tolerates f faults. We now show that R(G',p')/F has 
diameter no greater thand for IFl_<f. Let x,y V'-V withx matched tox'and y to y' (x',y'eV), and assume 
G' contains at most f faults. Let F' consist of the set F with the following two changes: 1) xily'¢F 
', 2) if (x,w)cF, then (x,w)¢F' but weF'. Note that I F'I _<'f. Therefore, there exists a path in R(G,p)/F' 
from x'toy'. Replacing x' by x and y' by y gives a path from x to y in R(G,p)/F. We leave to the reader 
the verification that the distance between nodes in R(G',p'), when at least one of the nodes is in V, 
remains no greater than d. Theorem 2. Let G = (V,E) be (d,f)-tolerant with every node If the maximum 
indegree in the original graph is Z, then in G having degree no greater than /~o. Then for IV [ < N in 
the new graph we have degree #+ 1. It is straightforward 540 to generalize this construction to handle 
the case where I VI < N < 21VI. As N increases in size relative to IVI, how-ever, the maximum degree 
of G' increases accordingly. [] A construction similar to the one in the padding lemma can be used to 
extend a graph with I VI nodes to a graph with up to 2IVI nodes at the cost of at most doubling the maximum 
degree while maintaining the same diameter and fault tolerance. 5. Other hounds. For a graph G of n G 
nodes, denote by "~G the minimum degree of the nodes in G. Theorem 3. GxH is (3,f)-tolerant, where f 
= : max{min{'~H,nG-I }, min{nG,nH-I ]}. Proof. Let GxH have fewer than f faults. Without loss of generality 
assume f = min{~H, n G- 1 ]. Therefore, there is at least one fault-free H plane; denote it by H k. Define 
PGXH as before, with the difference being that PG and OH are arbitrary (not necessarily shortest path) 
routings on G and H. Let x,y be any two nodes in GxH. Assume first that y is not a neighbor of x. To 
each of the T/H neighbors u of x in its H plane, associate a different neighbor v of y in its H plane, 
or u itself if u is also a neighbor of y. Let U be the set of pairs constructed in this manner together 
with the pair (x,y). The set U defines in an obvious way .~tt+l paths from x to y, all of them going 
through H k and disjoint outside H k. There-fore, at least one of them is fault free and has length no 
more than 3 in the induced graph. In the case that x and y are neighbors, if the edge (x,y) is not faulty, 
the distance is 1. Otherwise, the corresponding set U will have ~H pairs with at worst nil--I faults 
on them. [] Using similar observations about faultiness in G and H planes one can obtain other bounds 
similar to the one in Theorem 3. 6. Remarks. The proof of the main theorem can be greatly simplified 
if the following conjecture due to Joe Halpern is true. Let G be a (d,f)-tolerant graph and let o be 
a (d,f)-tolerant consist- ent routing on G. Then between every pair of nodes in R(G,p) there are at least 
f+l node disjoint paths ~1, ~r2 ..... ~rf+ t of length d or less such that the paths P(~t), pot2) ..... 
p(wf) are node disjoint. This property does not hold for in- consistent routings. 7. Open problems. Our 
"building blocks" usually will be small graphs with a prime number of nodes, Pl, P2 ..... Starting from 
these blocks, we can construct (2,f)-tolerant graphs that have pilp~2p~.., nodes. If we want to construct 
a (2,f)-tolerant graph with N nodes and if the gaps in such a sequence are not greater than O(N/(log 
N)2), then we can use a generalization of the padding theorem to construct such graphs where the maximum 
degree is less than log N + c for some constant c independent of N. Hence we have the following number 
theoretic question: what is the minimum number of prime numbers such that, for any N, the gaps in the 
above sequence are no greater than O(N/(log N)2)7 It seems plausible that the answer is 3 and that the 
dcsired bound can be obtained using 2-, 5-, and 7-cycles. (For 2-, 3-, 5-, and 7-cycles the maximum gap 
up to 10,000 nodes is 199). Fo r known results onthis problem, see [Til 1, ETi2 ], and references therein. 
In general, we would like to know what is the optimum N node graph and what is its optimum routing for 
any N given a desired (d,f)-tolerancc. Acknowledgements. We would like to thank Joe Halpern both for
