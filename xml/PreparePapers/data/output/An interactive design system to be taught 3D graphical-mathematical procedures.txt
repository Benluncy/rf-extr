 AN INTERACTIVE DESIGN SYSTEM TO BE TAUGHT 3D GRAPHICAL-MATHEMATICALPROCEDURES by Donald V. Steward, 
and Marion J.  A designer doing 3D mechanicallayouts needs to mix graphical and mathematical operations, 
as for example: point to a 3D object displayed on the screen and use its location to compute a position 
to insert another object. Itwould be desirable to teach complex new procedures to the system by performing 
the procedure once. This would free the designer to develop procedures tailored to his own needs without 
relying on programming support. Thus new design applications could be readily generated. We are presently 
completing such a system.  Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work or
