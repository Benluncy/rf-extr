 A DATA COMMUNICATIONS COURSE FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MAJORS James T. Perry and Norman E. Sondak Information 
Systems Department College of Business Administration San Diego State University Abstract Information 
Systems is a rapidly growing, fully recognized profession which will continue to expand. Currently, the 
need for people with a solid foundation in information systems far exceeds the supply; this is well documented 
in a number of recent articles. For an information systems degree program to remain viable, however, 
it must be reevaluated periodically to ensure that the course offerings are both current with respect 
to the available technology, and of real value to the student who will be applying his acquired skills 
and knowledge in industry, government, or university. One topic area of information systems which has 
been, largely, ignored until recently is data communications. This field has been recognized as a valu- 
able tool to our students; therefore, it has been included as; one of the core requirements for our under- 
graduates. This course stresses the management information systems aspects of data communications. The 
pedagogical objectives of the course are that the student be able to analyze, design, implement, and 
evalu- ate data communications applications in a business system environment. The structure and content 
of such a data communications course is presented. Sufficient detail is given so that similar courses 
can be adapted to fit into a computer science curriculum, with slight changes in emphasis, or incorporated 
directly into an existing information systems program. Key Words: Information systems, education, data 
communication, distributed processing, protocols, networking. INTRODUCTION The information systems

by double side lines. One of the goals of the information systems degree program is to produce people 
who have a thorough knowledge of the basic principles contained in typi- cal computer science curricula 
and a firm grounding in business data processing. The information sys- tems degree program is different 
from traditional computer science in several ways. For example, in- formation systems graduates are able 
to deal with the overall design of "systems" from the "human end." That is, they are concerned with 
the appear- ance of a system to the end user, in addition to the design of the system with respect to 
hardware specifications. Additionally, armed with an under- standing of available hardware and software, 
stu- dents can propose the design of a system, imple- ment and test it, and (if necessary) suggest appro- 
priate hardware to complete the system. Because of the way information needs have changed over the past 
decade, information systems students must be able to integrate their knowledge of busi- ness information 
needs and knowledge of systems design. A data communications course, together with the courses listed 
above, form the "critical mass" necessary for them to have this capability. Data communications is a 
capstone course for our majors. It is offered, quite naturally, to them near the end of their undergraduate 
careers, since it requires previous knowledge of programming lan- guages, systems design, business analysis, 
and data management systems. The bibliography presented at the end of this paper contains over i00 references. 
This lengthy collection of references to recent ar- ticles can be used by the reader to augment the textbook 
material in various sub areas of data com- munications. In addition, the articles may be used to develop 
course material for further, advanced courses in data communications. Several course textbooks are included 
in the bibliography. The next section describes the data communications course. A detailed outline and 
discussion of the course is presented. COURSE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY The growing trend toward data communications 
based distributed systems has made it imperative that a modern bachelors degree program in information 
sys- tems include a course in data communications theory and applications. The course is designed to 
convey to the student the basic scope of the following: i. The recognition that distributed systems 
take on many forms and cover a diverse range of system architectures. Distributed systems could mean 
off- loading of support function from a large mainframe computer by use of front and back-end processors, 
or to one organization with a set of intelligent terminals, geographically dispersed, to give remote 
sites more responsive computational support to one another. 2. A fundamental feature of successful data 
com- munications and distributed systems is the use of multiple, cooperating computing elements to perform 
 tasks that were either previously not performed at all or were performed centrally on a large mainframe 
computer. 3. Key factors in the design of successful data communications based distributed systems are: 
 a. Reliability of both hardware and software structures. b. Responsiveness in terms of both direct ac- 
cess and turn-around time. c. Potential for incremental growth by the addition of Drocessin~ units and 
bv off- loading. d. Simple correspondence to organizational patterns through network arrangements. e. 
Resource sharing by allowing computing pow- er, data bases and program availability at a wide number 
of sites. The course must treat not only the technical and design issues, but the managerial aspects 
as well. The managerial concerns of centralization versus decentralization, control of data processing 
and the continual broadening of the nature of processed information are difficult and unfamiliar to 
stu- dents. The technical foundations include communi- cations, inter-computer coupling, executive soft- 
ware structures, systems design and architecture, file and data base design, and allocation of re- 
sources and functions in a multiprocessor environ- ment. COURSE STRUCTURE The course is generally organized 
into four basic sections: fundamentals of data communications, network architecture, systems design 
and analysis, and managing distributed systems. Course Goals and Objectives. The first section of the 
course on fundamentals is designed to supply a basic data communications vocabulary, indicate sys- tems 
components and describe common carrier ser- vices. The second section on network architecture presents 
network topology concepts in both hard- ware and software terms. The third section covers data communications 
systems analysis and design techniques. The last section is direeted towards the problems of installation, 
operation and main- tenance of distributed data processing systems. While the case studies are listed 
in the outline as item 3.5, the intent is to present them individ- ually during the term so that they 
serve as a uni- fying element, bringing together the diverse course concepts. Each case study engages 
the student in successively more complex data communications pro- blems. Upon completion of the course, 
the students will be able to analyze and design fundamental data communications systems and present or 
detail cost/ benefit supporting documentation for such designs, remaining current in the field by reading 
and un- derstanding the general data communications litera- ture. The course outline is as follows:

Models Integrated Information Resources Organizational Impacts Case studies play an extremely important 
role in the study of data communications. They are in- cluded in III, section 3.5, of the course outline 
shown above and are used to ensure the relevance of theoretical concepts to practical situations. It 
is the authors' belief that in order to best understand data communications, credence is sub- stantially 
enhanced if students are given rela- tively straightforward examples of extant, working and viable data 
communications systems that have been operated successfully in business environments Four case studies 
are currently being used for this course. They cover the broad spectrum of applica- tions currently in 
place in various business orga- nizations which have need for distributed data pro- cessing. Each of 
these cases is examined from two different viewpoints. First, each case is examined using the currently 
popular top-down analysis. That is, students start with the given, total data com- munications system 
and presume that the final con- figuration is correct. At each successively lower level (e.g., more detailed 
examination of suppor- tive hardware and software), one then attempts to justify the immediately higher 
"level" in terms of function and cost effectiveness. This proceeds "do~mn" to the most fundamental layers 
(e.g., proto- cols, error checking, etc.). At each level exa- mined, the considerations that "forced" 
the next higher level are determined. Following this, the second "view" taken of the system is the 
opposite of the above process. That is, the system is syn- thesized bottom-up, attempting to develop 
an even better solution to the problem. This is a highly likely event, since one has the advantage 
of hind- sight in the form of the first analysis. The four representative case studies that are used 
 are given next. As experience is gained, the par- ticular examples used in each of the four case types 
can be changed easily. This may be necessary when, for example, it becomes clear that one (or more!) 
of the cases has become antiquated. 148 Case Study I -The Corporate Field Office. One of the first 
exposures into distributed processing is the corporate field office. The initial case cov- ers this 
typical application and asks for a system design for a next county office. The application involves 
account data and customer service. Case Study II -The College Computer Center. The College Computer 
Center examined in this study has three satellite locations, a "central time sharing" access and several 
remote job entry stations. The systemalso supports Word Processing facilities. The study requests recommendations 
for system expan- sion to handle a new satellite campus and program- ming laboratories using intelligent 
terminals. Case Study III-All the News That's Fit to Print. This study examines the need to improve 
distributed processing capabilities at a local newspaper. The paper presently has five minicomputers 
and one main- frame system. This application is used in the pro- duction of the daily paper and complete 
advertiser accounting. The problem facing the student is sys- tem integration and improving throughput. 
The fu- ture system must also accommodate data communica- tions from Western Union's West Star III Satellite 
service and an improved pagination software package for paper production. The student is requested to 
analyze the present network and develop an orderly plan for systems growth. Case IV -Nationwide "Service" 
Firm. This organi- zation has regional, district, and local sales offices and several regional computer 
centers. The problem here involves broadband intercenter communication links, load leveling and distributed 
data bases. The student is asked to prepare a five-year D.D.P. proposal with the emphasis on the management 
pro- blems facing the organization. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Information systems is a rapidly evolving 
disci- pline. As hardware and software advances occur, academia must be aware of these changes and 
res- pond to them by creating the kind of learning en- vironment and courses that best prepare students 
 for the challenges that they will be given in in- dustry. It is not possible for educators to ig- 
nore the area of data communications, particularly in the information systems environment. Students 
 must be able to understand the fundamental con- cepts contained in data communications such as distributed 
processing, host processors, network- ing, common carriers, and thelike. Further, stu- dents will be 
prepared to analyze the information needs and their flow through the corporate sys- tem, Given these 
needs and required "flows," stu- dents have the capability to propose a design, code, test, and evaluate 
that design. Their back- ground in data communications will give them the ability to, for example, select 
appropriate soft- ware, specify needed communication gear, and formu- late least cost (or minimal cost) 
networks to meet the stated performance requirements. We find evidence of the need for information sys- 
 tems people knowledgeable in data communications all around us. Our graduates have expressed this need 
on several, separate occasions. Industry re- sponds to the students' lack of experience in data communications 
by sending them to specialized semi- nars. This latter action, of course, is costly and time consuming. 
The data communications course described in this paper answers the above needs. Armed with a foundation 
in data processing, busi- ness courses, and the ability to integrate the two disciplines, graduates can 
develop the types of in- formation processing networks needed with minimal or no unproductive, "start 
up" time. A part of this "real world" experience is derived from the case studies portion of the data 
communi- cations course. During this part of their studies, they examine systems that are already in 
place. It is through this carefully organized scrutiny of ex- tant systems that students become familiar 
with all phases of data communications design, since the given solutions must be verified with respect 
to robustness, correctness, and cost effectiveness. In conclusion, we feel that data communications 
is emerging as an extremely important area of infor- mation systems. With adequate knowledge in this 
area, graduates entering the business sector or going on to graduate school will be much better prepared 
to solve the information processing pro- blems that lie ahead of them. BIBLIOGRAPHY "ACS: Comm or Computer,"
