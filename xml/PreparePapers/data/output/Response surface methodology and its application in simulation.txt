NY 10598 ABSTRACT The contents of this paper reflect a portion of the conference tutorial on the application 
of response surface methodology to simulation. In this paper we will present an outline of the methodology 
and give a simple example of its application to a two variable optimization problem. In the tutorial 
itself we will discuss the methodology in greater detail and discuss an additional application to a six 
variable optimization problem. The examples are taken from the simulation of a semiconductor manufactutig 
line. INTRODUCTION This is a discussion of the application of the statis­tical methodology of response 
surface exploration to simulation. Speciilcally, it is a discussion of the methodology summarized in 
the book Empirical Model Building and Response Surfaces by Box and Draper (1987). We assume that the 
simulation model has K con­tinuous parameters 61, ... . 6~ and that we are inter­ested in a performance 
characteristic, C(O 1, ,.. , d~), of the model, which is the expected value of an out­put random variable, 
Y(Ol, ... . 0~). In the examples we will consider, C is a cost function derived from the expected cycle 
time in a model of a semiconduct­or manufacturing line. The cycle time is the time from beginning of 
manufacture to completion. We are interested in exploring the surface C((I1, ... . OK). Y(61, ... . 19~) 
will be the sample mean of the cost function over a simulation run. The methodology we will describe 
involves the classical application of experimental design based on standard least squares theory. We 
assume that C(tll, ... . 19~)is smooth enough so that it can be ap­proximated by either a f~st or second 
degree polynomial over the sequence of regions of exper­imental activity. The methodology is sequential 
in nature with each successive experiment building on the results and insights of earlier experiments. 
Thus, it is ideally suited to simulation because of the rela­tive ease with which data can be obtained 
in the simulation context. In section 2 we will discuss the fitting of fwst order polynomials. In section 
3 we will discuss the fitting of second order polynomials (quadratics). In section 4 we will combine 
the results of sections 2 and 3 and discuss the optimization problem; i.e., the location of maxima or 
minima. We will give a simple exam­ple illustrating the technique on a semiconductor manufacturing model 
with two variables. The talk will go into much gyeater detail than the paper in all aspects of the methodology. 
Further, in the talk, in addition to the two variable example, we will give a six variable example. 2 
FIRST ORDER MODELS In fitting a f~st order model we assume that, in the region over which we conduct 
the experiment, C(e,, ... . OK) can be approximated by a function of the form K C(e,, ... ,6K)=~+ ~ akekf 
(1) k=l i.e. by a fust order polynomial. To explore this hy­pothesis the methodology uses 2 level fractional 
fac­torial designs with center points. In these designs a rectangular region of the (61, ... . 13~) space 
is defined by specifying two levels for each of the parameters, i.e. by specifying 19~1< ekz k = 1, 
... . K. These sets of levels would be such that, in the context of the application, it would make sense 
to explore a fwst order model over the region so defined. In the ap­plication of 2-level fractional factorial 
designs the  115 (0,, ... . 0~) coordinate system is replaced with the coordinates (xl, ... . .x@ where 
(2) The x~ coordinates take on the value -1 for the lower level, tl~l, and + 1 for the upper level, flu. 
Equation 1 then becomes K  C(xl, ... .xK)=~+ ~kxk. (3) x k=l C(el, ... . f?=) can be obtained by substituting 
(2) into (3). The designs assume that the output random variable Y(xI, ... . xK) has expectation C(XI, 
... . XK) plus independent, identically distributed, Gaussian noise. In the simulation environment the 
assump­tions of independence and normality do not usually present a problem but the assumption that the 
noise has a variance independent of (xl, ... . XK) is some­times troublesome. For further discussion 
of this issue, see Welch (1990). Two level fractional faetoria.1 designs possess a number of desirable 
features. First they provide a hierarchy of designs for fitting a hierarchy of more and more complicated 
two level models. The model of equation (3) is the simplest. This model assumes that each factor has 
an additive effeet which is inde­pendent of the level settings of the other factors. If this model is 
true the methodology of two level fractional factorial designs provides resolution 3 de­ signs which 
enable you efficiently obtain unbiased estimates of the parameters p and al, ... , ~K. The next most 
complicated model assumes that It is again additive. It assumes that the effect of changing the level 
of a parameter depends on the values of the other parameters but only in a pair wise fashion and in an 
additive way. If this more com­plicated model is true the methodology provides re­solution 4 designs 
which generate unbiased estimates of the ak independent of the values of the By and re­solution 5 designs 
which provide unbiased estimates i <j We are interested in the first order mo&#38;l because it may constitute 
a stieiently accurate model over the region of im.rnediate investigation. Further in the case of all 
three models the coefficients al, ... . ak de­ fine the path of steepest descent (ascent) which we shall 
see is critical to the optimization problem we will consider in the examples. In our examples, we will 
be selecting a minimum cost system. Hence, we will be interested in the path of steepest descent. If 
we let L = (~al)112 then a veetor of unit length in this direetion has coordinates al/~, ... . aK/L. 
In applying this methodology to these optimiza­tion problems we proceed as we will now outline. An initial 
experhnental region is selected. A fist order model is fit, checked to see if it is a reasonable fit 
and checked to make sure that a minimum does not fall within the region. An outke of the process for 
accomplishing this will be given below. If it is deeided that the first order model is valid, the path 
of steepest descent is followed to an estimated mini­mum of the cost function along this path. This procedure 
is then repeated for a region about this minimum point. If it is determined that it is likely that a 
minimum exists within the region then, as will be outlined in the next section, the design is aug­mented 
and a second order model is fit. This model is analyzed to determine whether or not a minimum exists 
and so on. To begin the process an initial design region is chosen by seleeting the levels f?kl < 6kz 
k = 1, ... . K. Ideally, a resolution 5 design is run with center points. Center points are replications 
at the center of the region, i.e. at the pOkt xl = -= xK = O. Then the standard techniques of 2 level 
fractional factorial model analysis are applied. These include confidence intervals on the coefficients, 
probability plots, residual plots, etc. The center points provide a curvature check. In particular c 
= average response over 2-level factorial runs -average response over center points provides an eSthXMte 
of ~ ~/+ H there is a minimum the &#38;k are d positive and hence the magnitude of c should be compared 
to the magnitude of the esti­mated coefficients. If c is large with respect to the ak, a fb.11quadratic 
model should be fit. of all the w and 13v The Ml quadratic model which In this process confidence intervals 
can be placed we will consider in the next section is on the direction of steepest descent as well as 
on the Response Su~ace coefficients and the curvature. If any of these esti­mates are not deemed accurate 
enough, additional replications and/or center points can be added to the design and the analysis repeated. 
There are two elements in the design of exper­iments which are important in other applications but would 
usually not be relevant in simulation applica­tions: blocking and randomization. They are de­signed to 
control the effects of variations in experimental conditions by either effectively includ­ing these variations 
in the model or by randomizing the order of the sequence of experimental trials. Such variations would 
not, appear to occur in the more pure world of simulation. SECOND ORDER MODELS Second order models 
cannot be fit with 2 level de­signs plus center points. Hence if, as the sequence of experiments is proceeding, 
the /3Y are not small with respect to the a~ and/or the estimate of curva­ture is high, a second order 
model will have to be fit. In fitting a second order model there is a class of central composite designs 
which is appealing for two reasons. First, they can be obtained by augmenting resolution 5, fractional 
factorial designs. Hence, they fit well into the sequential development of an inves­tigation. Second, 
they can be constructed so as to be rotatable; a concept we will discuss next. To standardize the variance 
of our estimate of the theoretical surface we generate a function V(X*, ... .XK) = (n/02) Variance(ijxl, 
... . K)) . called the variance function. Here n is the total number of runs and u is the standard deviation 
of the outcome of each mm The information function is defined as l(x~, ... . XJ() = ~ l(X1, ... . XK). 
 Now a design is rotatable if V and hence 1 are a fimction of xl, ... . x~ only through p = (x; + ...+ 
X;)U2 That is, if V and hence 1 are only a function of the distance from the origin in x space. Rotatability 
is a desirable feature since a priori there is usually no reason to favor any particular direction. 1(x1, 
... . x~) Methodology 117 will, in general, go to zero as the distance of the point xl, ... , x~ moves 
away horn the origin. Central composite designs are obtained fi-om re­solution 5, fraetiomd factorial 
designs by the addition of star points and perhaps more center points. Star points are poixits where 
one of the x, takes on the values + a while the remaining x, are all O. For ex­ample the pair of star 
points for the first variable would be (a, O, ... . O) and ( a, O, ... . O). Thus, for a design of K 
variables there would be 2K star points. When augmenting the 2 level design, the 2K star points can be 
replicated any number of times and additional center points added. Using the notation of Box and Draper 
the a that generates a rotatable design is given by (2k -~)rc 1 4 a= (6)G () where k is the number of 
factors, a 2k -P fractional factorial design of resolution 5 is being augmented, r. is the number of 
replications of the fractional fac­torial design and r, is the number of replications of the 2K star 
points. The above function for a is equation (14.3. 14) of Box and Draper. The infor­ mation function 
of the design is given as a function of p by equations (14.3.13) and (14.3.15) of Box and Draper. The 
information fi.mction is a function of 2k -P, rC, r, and the total number of center points. Once the 
central composite design has been gen­erated, the runs are made and the results are ana­lyzed. The coefficients 
are generated, confidence intervals produced, and the model checked using standard least squares methodology. 
The fitted sec­ond order model will have a stationary point. The experimenter will be interested in the 
characteristics of this stationary point and its location relative to the region of the design. There 
are two canonical forms of the model which are usefid for interpreting the stationary point and the behavior 
of the fitted surface in the region of the design. In the type A canonical form the axes are rotated 
so as to remove the cross product terms. Thus we have new variables yl, ... .y~ and a fitted f~ction 
of the form This is useful for interpreting the behavior of the re­sponse surface when the stationary 
point is some distance from the experimental region. For a dis­cussion of this case see Chapters 10 and 
11 of Box and Draper. In the type B canonical form, the origin of the coordinate system is translated 
to stationary point and hence, we have coordinates z1, ... . z~ and This is usefid for interpreting the 
behavior of the re­sponse surface when the stationary point is within the experimental region. h both 
C2U1012iCdforms the signs of the bii determine the type of stationary point. If it is a minimum, which 
is what we will be looking for in our examples, the bii must all be posi­tive. 4 A SIMPLE OPTIMIZATION 
EXAMPLE IN TWO DIMENSIONS 4.1 The Model We will consider the model of semiconductor man­ufacturing line 
logistics which was discussed in Hood, Amamoto and Vandenberg (1989) and Hood and Welch (1992). In this 
model, the line is subject to interruptions for tool set up, preventative maintenance and repair of failures. 
These interrupt processes are modeled as the highest priority sources of work for the tool groups. The 
interruptions (ar­rivals) and interrupt durations (service times) have i.i.d. exponential distributions. 
Hence, there are just two parameters for each interrupt process: the mean time between interrupts and 
the mean interrupt du­ration. In this simple example, we will consider only the setup interrupt process 
which was the process having the strongest effeet on model behavior. Hence, we will be considering two 
model parameters 61 = mean time between setup interrupts 62 = mean duration of setup interrupts. In 
the talk we will, in addition, consider a six pa­rameter example involving all three processes. The response 
variable, C is a function of R, the steady state mean cycle time: the mean elapsed time from entry into 
the manufacturing line until completion. In the application of the model there is a base case, a reference 
case which has model parameters judged to best approximate a planned line. We will be interested in opt 
irnizing over a region representing possible improvements on this base case. The refer­ence mean values 
(corresponding to the base case) for 01 and 62. are taken to be unity. An increase in dl or a deerease 
in 62 will reduce the mean cycle time which is beneficial. The range of 131,13zwe will con­sider is 1<81<2 
and .5< (32<1. The fbnction R(tll, I%) was estimated in extensive simulation and the estimated fimction 
is plotted in figure 1. Figure 1. Steady State Mean Cycle Time Now to illustrate the application of the 
method­ology, we need a cost function which has a minimum value. We generated such a function by assuming 
the cost to be given by C(el, eJ = R(el, eq) + 2oo@~ 1)2+ 1200(1 62)2 This cost function is plotted 
in figure 2. This func­tion was developed to provide an example for the methodology. We wanted a fi.mction 
which pos­sessed a minimum in a region of feasible values for the parameters. Its form is reasonable, 
with R(tll, 13Jrepresenting the inventory cost of the work in progress and the other two terms representing 
the costs associated with realizing improvements in 61 and 82. Hence each time we make a simulation run 
we generate a random variable Y(6I, tlJ given by qel, e2) = qel, 02) + ~ where G is an error random variable. 
We are inter­ested making a. series of simulation runs as the ele­ments of a sequence of experimental 
designs to estimate the location of the minimum point of C(dl, 02). That is, we are interested in pursuing 
the methodology destibed in Sections 2 and 3. Response Surface lamk Figure 2. Cost Function In creating 
this example, we did not actually run the simulation model, but rather simulated its run­ning. Since 
we knew the function C(O1, f3z), we could simulate the random variables Y(61, 13J by adding the noise 
random variable. In the earlier set of simul­ation runs that estimated R(dl, 62), it was determined that 
for a run of reasonable length the noise random variables were normally distributed with a standard deviation 
of 20. In the talk we will give an example with six variables where the simulation model was run to produce 
each data point. This two variable problem is designed to illustrate the essential features of the methodology 
in an environment where the important features of its operation carI be easily vis­ualized. 4.2 The 
Experiment In the work to be described next, we used an exper­imental extension of the IBM package A 
Graphical Statistical System (AGSS) . (See Lane and Welch (1987).) This package contains software for 
two level fractional factorial experiments with center points. For the purposes of this study we worked 
with an experimental internal IBM version which also includes central composite designs. We started the 
process of finding the minimum of C(f?l, 64 in a region in the immediate vicinity of the base case. We 
ran a 2 level experiment (with center points) with the levels of 01 being 1 and 1.2 and the levels of 
62 being .9 and 1. We ran a fidl factorial design replicated 5 times with 5 center points. The resulting 
coefficient confidence interval table is Methodology 119 shown in table 1. Notice that the main effects 
are large with respect to the interaction effect and that the main effects are statistically si~lcant 
whereas the interaction effect is not. Further, notice that the cumature is small and statistically i.nsigrdicant. 
Hence, a fust order fit is reasonable and we proceed to calculate and explore the path of steepest descent. 
However, at this point it is important to empha­ size the relationship of these kinds of results to 
the ease of data acquisition and the consequent potential flexibility in simulation experimentation. 
We con­ ducted a single experiment with five replications and then viewed the results. If they had been 
less con­ vincing, we could have added more replications and viewed the results of the extended experiment 
con­ tinuing this process until we became convinced either to move along the estimated path of steepest 
descent or to fit a second order model. As alternatives, we could have viewed the results after each 
replication or implemented a decision procedure in a higher level program which automatically took more 
data, made the requisite decisions and searched for a mini­ mum. Further such an automatic procedure 
could keep track of all its steps so its reasoning could be reviewed post facto by the experimenter. 
For further discussion of the potential of such higher level sys­ tems, see MacNair and Welch (1991). 
We return now to our search for the minimum of C(61, 13J. From the estimated coefficients of table 1 
we have that the estimate of the vector of unit length in the direction of steepest descent is given 
by (.6894, -7244) = (77.207, -81.118)/L where L = (77.2072 + 81. 1182)S. This direction, however, is 
relative to the coordinate system xl, X2 of the first design, not the coordinate system 61, 62. Hence, 
we have to make the appropriate transfor­ mation to generate a sequence of points along the direction 
of steepest descent starting from the center of the initial design, the point (01, /32)= (1.1, .95). 
We explored C(61, 19Z)along this path to estimate the point at which it assumes a minimum. This esti­ 
mated minimum point will be the center of the sec­ ond design. In estimating this minimum point we estimated 
 C(61, 02) at a sequence of eight equally spaced points each separated by a unit distance in (xl, x2) 
coordi­ nates. At each point we made 16 replications (i.e. 16 simulated runs). The estimates of C(t?l, 
Q along with 950/0 cotildence intervals are shown in figure 3. Notice there is a shallow minimum at the 
ftih point. We selected the location of this ffith point as the center for the second design. It is located

 Hence this second experiment was augmented to create a rotatable central composite design capable of 
estimating the full second order model. The star portion was replicated 5 times so, from equation 6, 
a = 25 = 1.414. In figure 4 we show the information function with 5 additional center points added. No­tice 
the deerease in information near the center of the design. To remedy this we added 20 center points. 
The resulting information function is plotted in fig­ure 5. This is the information function for the 
ex­periment performed. Figure 4. Information Function for Central Com­posite Design with 5 Additional 
Center Points 0.4 p Figure 5. Information Function for Central Com­posite Design with 20 Additional 
Center Points The analysis of this central composite design in­dicated a minimum within the experimental 
region. Methodology 121 The table giving this information is shown in table 3. Notice from the signs 
of the squared terms in the A and B canonical forms that the stationmy point is a minimum. The location 
of the stationary point is given in terms of the xl, x2, coordinates relative to the new center. The 
estimated location of the minimum in 61, 82 coordinates is 1.4457, .7415. The estimated minimum value 
is 1046.1. In Figure 6 we have plotted the contour function of the fitted quadratic over the experimental 
region. The best way to view the behavior of the tit in this case is in terms of the type B canonical 
form. The contours of constant cost are ellipses centered at the minimum point. Figure 6. Contour Plot 
of Fitted Quadratic Over the Fhtal Experimental Region 6 SUMMARY This has been a brief discussion on 
the application of the response surface exploration methodology of Box and Draper (1987) to simulation. 
This method­ology has a number of features which fit well into the framework of simulation experimentation. 
It is se­quential so it matches well the ready availability of data in the simulation context. It is 
sequential both in the model fitting and estimation at each exper­imental stage and in the generation 
of a sequence of experimental stages. It produces cotildence intervals on the estimates of interest and 
powerful diagnostics for the model fitting. It provides a solid theoretical and intuitive base in classical 
regression theory for the experimental process so that people applying it should know at all times where 
they are and what they are about. RESPONSE SURFACE ANALYSIS The STATIONARY POINT (MINIMUM) is INSIDE
