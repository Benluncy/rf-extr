as one of e.ective methods to enhance utilization of radio spectrum. Main principle of cog­nitive radio 
is that the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to use the spectrum not used by primary users (PUs) without 
interfering PU s transmission. In this paper, we consider network system where PUs use channels under 
super-slot time structure and SUs content to access channels during un­used super-slot so as not to interfere 
PU s transmission. For contention resolution, super-slot is divided into slots of .xed size which are 
used as backo. unit for backo. algorithm. For contending SUs, our proposed MAC protocol operates by the 
following modi.ed CSMA/CA with binary backo. algorithm: Each SU uniformly chooses a backo. counter from 
the current backo. window. The backo. counter in­dicates the number of slots that the station has to 
wait be­fore the transmission. At the beginning of super-slot, SU senses pre-determined number of channels. 
If there are no idle channels, then the backo. counter of the SU is frozen during a current super-slot 
duration. If there are idle chan­nels, then the SU decrements its backo. counter by one per each time 
slot as long as time slot is idle. When the back­o. counter of the SU reaches zero, the SU transmits 
the packets as many of .xed size as idle channels accommodate in the current super-slot. During backo. 
procedure of the SU, if other SUs occupy the remaining idle channels, back­o. counter of the SU is frozen 
during the remaining part of super-slot and is reactivated when at least one channel is sensed idle at 
the beginning of the super-slot. We construct the three-dimensional discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) 
to investigate the performance of the proposed multi-channel MAC protocol and we obtain stationary probability

frequency has been traditionally allocated by spec­trum management authority to licensed users for exclusive 
use. Allocating a .xed frequency band to each wireless ser­vice, which is the current frequency allocation 
policies, is an easy and natural approach to eliminate interference be­tween di.erent wireless services. 
However, extensive mea­surements reported indicate that large part of licensed bands are in low utilization, 
for example, only 6% in most of the time [1]. Furthermore, even when a channel is actively used, the 
bursty nature of most data tra.cs still implies that a great amount of opportunities exist in using the 
spare spec­trum. In order to better utilize the licensed spectrum, the Federal Communication Committee 
(FCC) has recently suggested a new concept/policy for dynamically allocating the spectrum [2]. This is 
the basis of the cognitive radio, which is proposed to improve the utilization of the existing radio 
spectrum. In the cognitive radio network, a licensed user is called a primary user (PU) and a user utilizing 
spectrum opportu­nities is called a secondary user (SU). The secondary users (SUs) are allowed to use 
the spectrum unused by primary users (PUs) as long as the PUs do not use it. This operation is called 
opportunistic spectrum access. To suppress the in­terference to the PUs, the SUs have to perform spectrum 
sensing before their attempts to transmit packets. Upon de­tecting that the PU is idle, SUs can make 
use of the the spectrum for transmission. Recently, several researchers have tried to do design oppor­tunistic 
MAC protocols for cognitive radio networks. Most of these protocols were discussed in recent survey papers 
[3, 4]. We review only the related works [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] which deal with IEEE 802.11-based opportunistic 
spectrum access for SUs in cognitive radio networks. Fan et al. [10] proposed adaptive transmission protocol 
by limiting trans­mission probability of SUs where both PUs and SUs try to access the channel based on 
802.11 DCF protocol in cogni­tive radio network with a single channel. Hoang et al. [7] considered 802.11-based 
cognitive radio network with a sin­gle channel where PUs operate on slot-by-slot basis and SUs employs 
a modi.ed 802.11 DCF to access the time unused by PUs where each SU is assumed to be able to transmit 
a packet with a .xed size. To further improve the through­put for SUs compared to the MAC protocol [7], 
recently, Bae et al.[11] proposed a modi.ed IEEE 802.11 DCF based opportunistic MAC protocol for SUs 
which allows SUs to transmit packets with variable length depending on the re­maining time of the current 
slot. However, all of these works [10, 7, 11] dealt with cognitive radio network with a single channel. 
In this paper, we propose CSMA/CA based multi-channel opportunistic MAC protocols for cognitive radio 
network. To investigate the performance of our proposed MAC proto­col, we develop Markov chain model. 
The resulting one-step transition probability matrix of our Markov chain has a very special structure 
which makes the computation of stationary distribution less cumbersome by allowing us to use the idea 
of censored Markov chain. Based on the stationary distri­bution of the Markov chain, we obtain the distribution 
of HoL-delay of packet and the normalized throughput of SUs. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
In section 2, we propose the multi-channel MAC protocols for cognitive radio networks. In section 3, 
we construct the analytical models to study the proposed MAC protocol. Section 4 presents the numerical 
results of analytical models and discusses the HoL delay and the normalized throughput when the number 
of groups varies. In section 5, we conclude this paper.  2. PROPOSED COGNITIVE RADIO MAC PRO-TOCOL In 
this paper, we consider a primary network consisting of M licensed channels. The primary network operates 
on super­slot basis so that PU sends a packet during whole super­slot in a synchronous manner. Meanwhile, 
secondary users, which are synchronized with the PUs, opportunistically ac­cess the licensed spectrum 
without imposing interference to the PUs. Thus, all secondary users utilize the licensed chan­nels unused 
by primary users. We model each channel as an ON-OFF source alternating between state ON (busy) and state 
OFF (idle). An ON/OFF channel usage model spec­i.es whether a PU occupies (ON state) super-slot of the 
 Figure 1: The ON-OFF channel usage model for pri­mary users channel or does not occupy (OFF state). 
The SUs can uti­lize the OFF super-slot to transmit their own packets. We assume that ON/OFF process 
of channels are independent and identically distributed. Let ß be the probability that a channel transits 
from state OFF to state ON and a be the probability that a channel transits from state ON to state OFF. 
Then, a channel states of ON and OFF can be char­acterized by a two-state Markov chain as shown in Fig. 
1. Then, the probability . that a channel is occupied by the primary users given by ß . = . (1) a + ß 
 We consider that each SU is equipped with M channel sen­sors which can sense M channels at one time, 
i.e., SUs per­form all sensing of channels. At the beginning of each super­slot, each SU performs channel 
sensing with M sensors to .nd out which channels at current super-slot are occupied by the PUs, and try 
to transmit packets through the contention­based algorithms. Super-slot is divided into K slots of .xed 
size which are used as backo. unit for backo. algorithm. For the colli­sion resolution of the proposed 
MAC, a modi.ed CSMA/CA with binary backo. algorithm is employed as follows: At the beginning of super-slot, 
SU senses M number of chan­nels. While at least one idle channel is detected, before each transmission 
attempt, a SU uniformly chooses an inte­ger number from current backo. window [0,Wi - 1] where Wi is 
the current value of its backo. stage after i collisions. The chosen value, referred to as a backo. counter, 
indicates the number of slots that the station has to wait before the transmission. Let Wmin be the initial 
backo. window. In the case of a collision, its backo. window size is doubled,i.e., Wi =2iWmin after i 
collisions. The maximum backo. win­dow size is Wmax =2mWmin for some integer m where m is called the 
maximum backo. exponent. If the maximum is reached, then it is not doubled, but .xed. If there are no 
idle channels upon sensing at the beginning of super-slot, then the backo. counter of the SU is frozen 
during the super­slot duration. If there is at least one idle channel, then the SU decrements its backo. 
counter by one per a time slot as long as time slot is idle. Let T be a packet length of .xed size. When 
the backo. counter of the SU reaches zero, if the remaining time of current super-slot is larger than 
or equal to T so that it has enough time to transmit packet, the SU transmits as many the packets as 
idle channels ac­commodate in the current super-slot. If the remaining time of current super-slot is 
smaller than T , the backo. counter  Figure 2: Single-Channel MAC protocol of the SU is frozen during 
remaining part of current super­slot duration. The backo. counter of the SU is reactivated at the beginning 
of the super-slot which contains at least one idle channel. During backo. procedure of the SU, if other 
SUs occupy the channels, backo. counter of the SU is frozen during the remaining time of super-slot, 
and the backo. counter is reactivated when at least one channel is sensed idle at the beginning of the 
super-slot.  3. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE PRO-POSED MAC PROTOCOL In this section, we deal with the 
case of single-channel in section 3.1 and multi-channel with all sensing in section 3.2. We construct 
the Markov chain model to analyze the head of line (HoL) delay of packet and normalized throughput of 
SUs. We assume that each SU always has data packets to send. 3.1 Analysis for the Proposed MAC Protocol 
under the Single-Channel Condition Fig.2 illustrates our proposed MAC protocol under the single­channel. 
In this model, there is only one channel and all SUs in the system try to transmit packets through the 
contention­based algorithms. Markov Chain Model We construct the three-dimensional Markov chain model 
to investigate the performance of the proposed MAC protocol under the single-channel condition. Let Ns, 
K, T be the total number of SUs in a group, the duration of a super-slot and the required minimum duration 
for a packet transmis­sion, respectively. Let us consider an SU, called tagged SU. Let a(t) be the stochastic 
process representing the backo. stage of the tagged SU at time t. Let b(t) be the stochastic process 
representing the backo. time counter for a tagged SU. In addition, to account for super-slot boundary 
impact due to super-slot with a .nite length, we need to introduce c(t) an additional stochastic process. 
Let c(t) be the slot number in a super-slot. Then, (c(t),a(t),b(t)) is a three di­mensional discrete 
time embedded Markov chain where the embedded points of the Markov chain consist of the point in which 
backo. counter is decremented. We de.ne P(k1,i1,j1)(k2,i2,j2) = P {c(t +1) = k2,a(t +1) = i2, b(t +1) 
= j2 | c(t)= k1,a(t)= i1,b(t)= j1}. The one-step transition probability is given by P(k,i,j)(0,i,j-1)

Ps and Pc will be given by (2), (3), (4) and (5), respectively. Denote by pk,i,j = limt.8 P {(c(t),a(t),b(t))= 
(k, i, j)}the limiting probability of the Markov chain {c(t),a(t),b(t)}where k =0, 1, ··· ,K-T, i =0, 
1, ··· ,m, j =0, 1, ··· ,Wi- 1. Let pk = (pk,0,0,pk,0,1, ··· ,pk,0,W0-1,pk,1,0, ··· ,pk,m,Wm-1), k =0, 
1, ··· ,K -T and p = (p0,p1, ··· ,pK-T ). The proba­bility t that a SU transmits in a randomly chosen 
slot time, and the probability Ptc that a transmitted packet collides, respectively, then K-Tm t = .. 
pk,i,0 k=0 i=0 Ptc =1 - (1 - t)Ns-1 . (2) Let Pi be the conditional probability that the randomly cho­sen 
time slot is an idle slot, given that the tagged station does not transmit. Pi is given by Pi = (1 - 
t )Ns-1 . (3) Let Ps be the conditional probability that the randomly cho­sen time slot is a successful 
transmission slot, given that the tagged station does not transmit. This event occurs when only one of 
the remaining stations transmits in a given slot. Ps is given by Ps =(Ns - 1)t (1 - t )Ns-2 . (4) Let 
Pc be the conditional probability that the randomly cho­sen time slot is a collision slot, given that 
the tagged station does not transmit. Pc is given by Pc =1 - Pi - Ps. (5) Note that p is the stationary 
probability vector of the Markov chain {(c(t),a(t),b(t)) : t = 0}. Next, we calculate the sta­tionary 
probability vector p of the Markov chain by applying the censored Markov chain concept [12]. Stationary 
Distribution of the Makov Chain In state (k, i, j), we call the .rst component k level. As we observe 
the behavior of state transition among levels, the one-step transition probability matrix P of the Markov

has a special structure that all the di­agonal blocks are zero. In order to .nd the stationary prob­ability 
vector of the Markov chain, we use a concept of cen­sored Markov chain. The application of censoring 
technique to this specially structured matrix Pmakes the computation easier. We give an overview of 
the well-known property of censored Markov chain which will be used in this paper. Consider a discrete 
Markov chain {Xt : t =1, 2, ···} with .nite state space S. Let S be partitioned into two arbitrary subsets 
E and Ec . Suppose that the successive visits of Xt to E take place at time epoch 0 <t1 <t2 < ··· . Then 
the chain {XrE = Xtr : r =1, 2, ···} is called the censored (restricted or watched) Markov chain with 
the censoring set E. Let P denote the transition matrix of original Markov chain Xt. Consider a block 
description of P as follows: PEE PEEc P =. (7) PEcE PEcEc Note that the censored Markov chain watches 
the chain only when it is in E. Assuming that original process Xt with .­nite state space is irreducible, 
the one-step transition prob­ability matrix P (E) of the censored Markov chain is on the censoring set 
E given by P (E)= PEE + PEEc (I - PEcEc )-1PEcE. (8) Its stationary probability vector pkE of censored 
Markov chain on the censoring set E is proportional to stationary prob­ability vector pk of original 
process Xt (Theorem 5.3.1 in [12]). Let S be the level space of the Markov chain with one­step transition 
probability matrix given by (6), i.e., S = {0, 1, ··· ,K - T }. We de.ne censoring set Sa,b ={a, a + 
1, ··· ,b} for a, b . S. Let P(Sa,b) be denoted by the one­step transition probability matrix of the 
censored Markov chain on the censoring set Sa,b. Next, we will .nd the one-step transition probability 
matrix P(S0,K-T -1) of the censored Markov chain on the censoring set S0,K-T -1. By applying the (8), 
P(S0,k), 0 = k = K -T , are given by P(S0,K-T -1)= P(S0,K-T -2)= 0 1 2 3 · · · K - T - 1 0 . A B . 1

transition probability matrices of censored Markov chain on the censoring sets S0,k for 0 = k = K - T 
. We construct the stationary vector by adding back one level at each step starting from level 0. The 
stationary vectors p0,p1, ··· ,pK-T are obtained as fol­lows: 1. Let xk,k =0, 1, ··· ,K - T, be positive 
row vectors and x0 satis.es x0P(S0,0)= x0. Then, we can .nd positive row vector x0 that satis.es (K-T

satisfy (x0,x1, ··· ,xk)P(S0,k)=(x0,x1, ··· ,xk), where P(S0,k) is given by (9). Thus, we have x1 = x0B 
x2 = x1B . . . xk = xk-1B 3. Calculate g = 2K-T xl1, where 1 is the 2m 2lWmin­ l=0 l=0 dimensional column

,K - T. g Analysis for HoL Delay In order to obtain the delay distribution of HoL packet, we de.ne several 
parameters as follows: Next, we derive the PGF (Probability Generating Function) of HOL-delay of a packet. 
HOL-delay is de.ned as the duration from the ar­rival time at the head of the queue, i.e., beginning 
point of the backo. procedure of a packet, to beginning point of the packet transmission. Let Ptr be 
the probability that there is at least one trans­mission in the considered slot time. Since Ns SUs contend, 
and each SU attempts to transmit packets w.p. t in a slot, the probability Ptr is given by Ptr =1 - (1 
- t )Ns . (10) The probability Pts that a transmission occurring on the channel is successful is given 
by the probability that exactly one station transmits on the channel, conditioned on the fact that at 
least one station transmits, i.e., Nst (1 - t)Ns-1 Pts = . (11)Ptr Let XSU be the random variable of 
the consecutive time duration that the channel is occupied by SUs because of SU s data transmission during 
a super-slot. Let XSU (z) be the PGF of the random variable XSU . Since the transmission attempt of arbitrary 
SU occurs with probability Ptr, the probability P {XSU =(K - t)} is given by P {XSU =(K - t)} = (1 - 
Ptr)tPtr. Thus, the PGF of the XSU is given by K-TK-t XSU (z)= . (1 - Ptr)tPtr · z. t=0 Fig.3 shows 
the three kinds of slots that the tagged station experiences during its backo. stage. Since the probability 
PT that the tagged station takes the slot of which length is T during its backo. stage is m Wi-1 PT = 
.. pK-T,i,j , i=0 j=1 thus, the length of a slot is s with probability Pi(1 - PT ) or is T with probability 
PiPT , or is XSU with probability Ps + Pc. Let Pbusy be the probability that channel is occupied by the 
primary users. Since the number of channel is one, Pbusy = . by (1). Let TW (i, z) be a PGF of the time 
duration of the i-th backo. stage. Since the busy super-slot of PUs can be occurred with probability 
Pbusy(= .) at the end of the slots of which the length is equal to T or XSU , the PGF TW (i, z)  Figure

suc­cessfully. Let J be the random variable representing the number of collisions that the tagged packet 
experiences, given that it is transmitted successfully. Then, J has the proba­bility mass function such 
that P {J = j} =(Ptc)j (1 - Ptc). If the tagged packet experiences j collisions until a packet is transmitted 
successfully, then the PGF of HOL-delay S is given by j (( 8))j S kkK E[z |J = j]= TW (i, z) . P · z.

be the normalized throughput of the channel, de.ned as the fraction of time that the channel is used 
to successfully transmit packets. The normalized throughput Rsingle is given by Rsingle = (1 - Pbusy)

Proposed MAC Protocol under the Multi-Channel Condition In this section, we develop analytical models 
of our proposed MAC protocol of the multi-channel with all sensing. Let H be the number of idle channels 
in a speci.ed channel group with M channels. We assume that the channel states among di.erent channels 
are independent with each other. Then, the number H of idle channels follows the Binomial distribution, 
that is, ( M )iM-i P {H = i} = (1 - .).. i Thus, the probability that all channels in a group are oc­cupied 
by the primary users is equal to P {H =0} = .M . Therefore, the backo. counter of the SU in the group 
is frozen during a super-slot duration with probability .M , and the SU decrements its backo. counter 
by one per each time slot during a super-slot duration with probability 1 - .M . Thus, Similar to the 
methods in section 3.1 with replacing Pbusy = P {H =0} = .M , then the PGF TW (i, z) is given by Wi-1

we give examples for the HoL delay of packet and the normalization throughput of proposed MAC proto­col. 
We consider the scenario with length of a slot, 1 slot=s=50µs, the duration of a super-slot, K = 100 
slots, the minimum requirement duration for a packet transmission, T =10 slots and the probability that 
one channel is occupied by the pri­mary users, .=0.5. Fig.4 depicts the HoL delay of packet of our proposed 
MAC protocol, vs. number of SUs Ns on x-axis, as the initial backo. window varies: Wmin = 32, 64. As 
the number of contending SUs increases, the HoL delay increases. In Fig.4, we see that the HoL delay 
of packet with Wmin = 32 is higher than that with Wmin = 64, because the large Wmin can resolve e.ciently 
the collisions among SUs. In particu­lar, the lager number of channels is, the less the HoL delay of 
packet becomes. The reason is that the larger number of channels gives the SUs to more opportunities 
for channel access. Fig.5 depicts the normalized throughput of our proposed MAC protocol, vs. number 
of SUs Ns on x-axis, as the ini­tial backo. window varies: Wmin = 32, 64. As shown in Fig.5, if the Wmin 
is set to 32, the maximum normalized throughput is achieved when Ns = 2 and as the number of SUs increases, 
the normalized throughput decreases linearly. On the other hand, if Wmin is set to 64, the normalized 
throughput increases while Ns increases from 2 to 4. After Figure 5: Normalized throughput of the proposed 
MAC protocol the maximum normalized throughput is achieved at 4, the normalized throughput decreases 
as Ns increases. When the number of SUs is relatively large, the normalized through­put with Wmin = 64 
is higher than that with Wmin = 32. We expect this result because the large Wmin can resolve e.ciently 
the collisions among SUs. 5. CONCLUSION In this paper, we consider network system where PUs use channels 
under super-slot time structure and SUs content to access channels during unused super-slot so as not 
to interfere PU s transmission. We propose a multi-channel MAC protocol which operates by the modi.ed 
CSMA/CA with binary backo. algorithm. We construct the three­dimensional DTMC to investigate the performance 
of the proposed multi-channel MAC protocol and we obtain sta­tionary probability vector of DTMC by censored 
Markov chain s method. Then, using the stationary probability vec­tor of DTMC, we obtain the HoL delay 
of packet and the normalized throughput. 6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was partially supported by
