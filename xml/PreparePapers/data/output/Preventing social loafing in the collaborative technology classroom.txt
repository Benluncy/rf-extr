 PREVENTING SOCIAL LOAFING IN THE COLLABORATIVE TECHNOLOGY CLASSROOM Mark A. Serva, Ph.D. Information 
Systems Department Baylor University Waco, TX 767984005 1.0 INTRODUCTION The collaborative learning 
model posits that learning in the classroom can be enhanced when students interact to share perspectives 
and ideas in a problem solving context (Alavi, et al, forthcoming). Work by a number of authors (Kleinfeld 
1972, Boseker 8z Gordon, 1983; Browne &#38; Bordeau, 1991) suggests that in more collaborative learning 
situations, where feedback exists between the instructor and students, or between students and students, 
learning opportunities increase. Teaching techniques which involve students in exercises of active learning 
(Bonwell and Eison, 1991), such as the CASE method of teaching (Hashim, Rathnam, and Whinston, 1991) 
are also being propounded as a means of achieving greater learning performance in the classroom context. 
In all of these cases, learning is improved through group activity, as students interact and exchange 
ideas. Through this interaction, students become active participants in integrating the material into 
their own cognitive style (Shnell, 1986; Wittrock, 1986) increasing their ability to remember, and later 
apply this knowledge to other contexts. Mark A. Fuller, Ph.D. Information Systems Department Baylor University

is also a potential downside. The social loafing literature tells us that individuals working in groups 
may not maximize their individual effort (Latane et al., 1979). Social loafing is defined as tendency 
of people to expend less effort when working collectively than working coactively (Williams and Karau 
1991). Albanese, and Fleey (1985) found that the mere presence of the group may cause individuals to 
fieeride , withholding effort while counting on other members to adequately deal with the task. While 
fieeriding does not necessarily lead to substandard group performance, it seems appropriate for instructors 
to minimize this type of behavior for a number of reasons. First, those individuals who loaf contribute 
less for the group to use, lowering the potential of the group s learning. Second, those individuals 
who loaf, not being engaged in the conversation, are reducing their opportunities to integrate knowledge 
into their own mental model (Ansari and Simon 1979, Neches 1978). Third, if a loafer effect is observed 
repeatedly in groups in a classroom context, non-loafers may start to resent group activities, believing 
that other members are not putting forth their fair share (Jackson and Harkins 1985). An additional stream 
of research has begun to explore the effects of information technology on teaching and learning (Leidner 
and Jarvenpaa, 1992). Studies relevant to this current work have focused on 84 collaborative technology 
and its impacts in the classroom (Alavi, 1994; Brandt and Briggs, 1995; Leidner and Fuller, 1996). In 
essence, collaborative technology (through the effects of features like anonymity and parallel processing) 
serves to level the playing field and increase participation, especially in larger groups. Pedagogically 
speaking, one might think that in order to maximize participation and idea exchange, the best collaborative 
configuration would involve large, anonymous groups. However, social loafing theory (through the effects 
of individual accountability and expectations of other team members performance) would suggest that smaller, 
non-anonymous teams might be the optimal configuration to increase collaboration. In order to determine 
the relative merits of the social loafing approach, this paper examines the impact of group size and 
anonymity levels on social loafing within the collaborative technology classroom. Figure 1 illustrates 
the expected effects of anonymity and group size on team members tendency to loaf The potential implications 
of this research on individual learning will be discussed, and areas of future research will be examined.
