154-0023 Japan +81-3-3422-3380 anjyo@olm.co.jp Two male cormorants living in Tokyo are currently between 
girlfriends. One spring day they decide to work together to make a splendid nest, believing that it will 
help attract a female. After much hard work, they complete the nest, but an unfortunate accident occurs 
on Christmas night ... Great cormorants are known for their interesting behavior. Sometimes a male bird 
who does not have a mate joins with another single male to build a nest. In this species, nest building 
is a male role, and two males can produce a large, impressive nest. Of course, without mates the nest 
is of no use, and science cannot tell us why the birds make this seemingly pointless effort. Humans are 
known for similar behavior. Sometimes we, too, pursue goals that outwardly have little chance of success, 
even to the point that our friends politely suggest that we are beating a dead horse. Everyone, at some 
point, undertakes an impractical quest that cannot be understood by others. So enjoy the story of One 
Pair and share the desires of their unfulfilled hearts! Story &#38; Director Chief 3DCG Designer Graphic
