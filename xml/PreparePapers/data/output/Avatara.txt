4AL United kingdom kam_work@hotmail.com This short film was originally inspired by the creator s experience 
of the bonds that people and plants share, and the residual energy left between a tree and its planter. 
The film encourages people to engage with nature more freely and more frequently, and it hopes to promote 
protection of the world s environment. Avatara was produced with a program that is not traditionally 
used to produce animations of this complexity and scale. Within the animation, there are 1,684 non-repeating 
frames that were individually painted by hand using a graphics tablet. Unlike most MA animation projects 
in the UK, this film was produced by only one student instead of a team, and it was created in a much 
shorter amount of time than most other MA projects. Story Research &#38; Development kam-Li Cheng kam-Li
