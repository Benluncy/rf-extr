 Course Content for Computer Science at the Secondary School Level A review of a preliminary report 
by the Task Group on Secondary School Computer Science, working under the ACM Elementary and Secondary 
Schools Subcommittee. Jean B. Rogers, Chair During the last year, a task group has been analyzing and 
describing content for courses in computer science that might be taught at the secondary school level. 
Four courses are being proposed and discussed: I) a half-year course on computers and society This course 
would address applications and implications of computer use and would not include instruction in programming. 
 2) a half-year course, introduction to programming This course would be a generally accessible course 
in programming and not necessarily require nor serve as a prerequsite for others courses. 3) a year 
course, introduction to computer science This course would teach a broad view of computer science and 
include instruction and practice with structured programming. 4) a year course, advanced computer science 
This course would be similar to the introductory computer science course, but would have greater depth 
of coverage. The prellminary report of content and sequence of these courses has been compiled and will 
be available during this conference session. Members of the task group will be present to discuss and 
hear suggestions about the proposed courses. Members of the task group are: Fred Achberger, Bremerton 
School District Robert Aiken, University of Tennessee John Arch, Houston Independent School District 
Michael Haney, Towson State Univerity Cheryl Lemke, Washington State Department of Education Jean Rogers, 
University of Oregon Sally Slone, Minneapolis Public Schools Thomas Swanson, University of Oregon Samuel 
Tumolo, Cincinnati Country Day School 181
