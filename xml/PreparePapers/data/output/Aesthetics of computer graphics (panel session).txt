 SIGG R A P H '85 Aesthetics of Computer Graphics Chair: Mihai Nadin (Rhode Island School of Design) 
Panel~t~ Charles Csuri (Cranston-Csuri Productions) Frank Dietrich (Artist) Thomas Linehan (Ohio State 
University) Hiroshi Kawano (Metropolitan (Tokyo) College of Technology) As graphics technology and software 
become more mature, it is critical to examine the aesthetics of computer generated images. Effective 
visual communication and artistic expression are dependent on aesthetic quality. Issues that emerge for 
artists, designers and computer scientists include: the formal attributes of images, aesthetic evaluation 
criteria and the desire to detect or implement aesthetic qualities. The panelists, having studied these 
and other issues, will present and debate their diverse viewpoints. The Creation of New Kinds of Interactive 
Environments in Art, Education, and Entertainment Chair: Stephen Wilson (San Francisco State University) 
Panelists: David Backer (Mirror Systems) Myron Krueger (University of Connecticut) Peter Richards (Exploratorium) 
Sonia Sheridan (School of the Art Institute (Emeritus)) David Ucko (Chicago Museum of Science and Industry) 
Artists and researchers are using the computer's interactive capabilities to develop innovative kinds 
of responsive settings. The gestures, sounds and other participant activities are used to control the 
flow of computer-mediated graphic, sound and kinetic events, lllustrated descriptions of several responsive 
settings will be presented. Panelists will discuss implications for changing traditionally passive art, 
education and museum settings. Â¢,
