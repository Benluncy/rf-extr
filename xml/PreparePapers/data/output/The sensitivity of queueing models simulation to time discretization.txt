William and Mary Williamsburg, VA 23185 The time continuum is often appoximated by discrete time units 
in the simulation and mathematical analysis of queueing systems, but little is known about the ef- fects 
of this approximation on the final results. This study shows that the effects of time discreteness on 
some queueing behavior is surprisingly small, and useful implications of this finding are discussed. 
1. INTRODUCTION In computer simulation, it is often necessary to approximate the time continuum of the 
real world with discrete time units. In queueing problems, two common examples in which time discreteness 
is introduced are: (i) In APL, if a programmer uses the expression (? i000) ÷ i000 (I) to generate uniformly 
distributed "customer service times" with a mean of 0.5 minute and a range of 0-i minute, the generated 
random times are restricted to taking values in multiples of 0.001 minute. That is, the system actually 
simulated behaves as if time exists in discrete units of 0.001 minute. (ii) In GPSS, time is explicitly 
treated as discrete units. To generate uniformly distributed customer service times having a mean of 
I0 minutes and a range of 5-15 minutes, one can write Generate 10, 5 (2) in which case the service times 
are restricted to taking integer values from 5 to 15. Alternatively, one can designate 1 clock time unit 
as equivalent to 0.I minute and write Generate 100, 50 (3) in which case the service times are restricted 
to taking values in discrete steps of 0.1 minute. In spite of this common practice of using discrete 
time units in simulation to approximate the time continuum, the effects of this approximation have seldom 
been formally investigated. The 3urpose of this paper is study the nature and magnitude of any effects 
of time discreteness in the simula-tion of simple queues. Examples of practical questions that this study 
may help to answer are discussed below: (i) What would be the difference between genera- ting random 
times by statements such as (? 100) ÷ 100 (in APL) (4a) Generate 10, 5 (in GPSS) (4b) versus statements 
such as (? 10000) ÷ 10000 (in APL) (5a) Generate 100, 50 (in GPSS) (5b) Of course, every programmer 
intuitively knows that by writing (? 1E10) ÷ 1E10 (in APL) (6~) Generate 100000, 50000 (in GPSS), (6b) 
81CH1709-5/81/0000-0341500.75 Q 1981 IEEE H. LAU, A. ZAKI the discreteness problem can be safely ignored. 
However, this does not really answer the original question. (ii) Relating to the preceding question, 
many users of GPSS will have encountered situations in which an entire GPSS program can be rewritten 
to require much shorter computer time if i clock time unit can be assigned as equivalent to 0. i minute 
instead of, say, 0.001 minute. Clearly, a programmer wants to know whether the greater accuracy of the 
latter version justifies the additional computer time. (iii) If time distributions are constructed from 
empirical data, the times are almost always collected in "classes" for the construction of histograms. 
Two questions will arise in these situations; firstly, if the times of the process actually follow a 
continuous density function, how reliable will be the simulation results obtained by using the empirically 
collected discrete distribution? Secondly, in order to ensure a good approximation of the natural conti-nuous 
process, what should be the "class width" used to collect the data? Of course, in both questions, the 
confounding issue of sampling error has to be temporarily ignored. (iv) Eventually, perhaps the most 
promising point is to find out the effects of using discrete time units in mathematical modelling. For 
example, if using discrete time units provides good approxi- mation in simulating a certain system, then 
using discrete time unitsmust also provide good approxi mation in the mathematical analysis of that system. 
One example is the numerical procedure presented in the "Methodology" section of this paper for obtaining 
a queue's waiting time distri-bution, and this point will be brought up again later. 2. DEFINITIONS AND 
OVERVIEW This study investigates the effects of different levels of time discretization on "customers' 
waiting time" in single-server queues. The service rate, u, is fixed at 1 customer per unit time, and 
queues with different utilization factors p are obtained by varying the arrival rate ~. 2.1 Definitions 
(i) The "level of discreteness"~ is the smallest unit of time permissible in the simulated system. For 
example, referring to the normalized ~ of 1 ~er unit time, simulating at the discreteness evel of~ : 
0.i means that the service and interarrival times can only exist in multiples of 0.i time units. In GPSS,~ 
= 0. i corresponds to representing i real time unit by i0 clock (or simulation) time units. The case 
of continuous time corresponds to~ i = 0.0. (ii) W~,p) is the "theoretical" customer's waiting time distribution 
when the utilization factor is p and the simulation is performed at the discreteness level of~. W~ ,p) 
is the corre-sponding mean waiting time. The corresponding sample waiting time distribution observed 
from a finite sumulation run is w~ ,p), and G~ ,p) is the corresponding sample mean of waiting time. 
 (iii) aij t = Wt(i,p) -Wt(j,p) is the absolute difference in the waiting time distribution at t between 
the discreteness levels of i and j. Similarly, aij t = wt(i,p) -wt(j,p) = Aijt's sample estimate. (iv) 
Dij : W(i,p) -W(j,p) , and dij = w(i,p) -w(j,p) : Dij's sample estimate.  2.2 Overview In this Study, 
we are primarily intereste~ in the effects oftime discreteness as reflected in the values of aij t and 
Dij. These values can be estimated from their sample values aijt and dij using simulation, they can also 
be computed via the waiting time distribution W~ ,p) obtained from a numerical procedure. These two procedures 
are discussed in the next section on "Methodology." Using these procedures, values of aij t a.ld Dij 
are estimated for queues with different distribu-tion forms of interarrival/services times, the results 
and an attempt to generalize them are presented in the fourth section. Generally speaking, the effect 
of time discreteness is found to be small. Finally, the implications of our results are briefly discussed 
in the concluding section. The third section may be skipped since an understanding of the methodologies 
is not neces-sary for the later sections. 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Simulation Obtaining the sample observations 
Aijt's and dij's by a Fortran simulation program is concep- tually straightforward; any required discreteness 
level can be obtained by rounding the generated continuous random numbers to the appropriate numbers 
of decimal places. However, the actual values of Aijy'S and Dij's turn out to be very small, whereas 
the variances and autocorrelations of their sample estimates (i.e., aijt's ~nd dij's) are comparative 
large; moreover, the variances and autocorrelations increase rapidly as p increases. Therefore, without 
using excessive computer time, we were only able to consider cases of moderate p, and reliable information 
was obtainable only on the signs, but not on the magnitudes of the Dij's. No reliable estimates of the 
Aijt's were obtainable. Fortunately, as will be seen later, these results are aJequate for the purpose 
of this study. 3.2 The Computational Procedure Our procedure for computing Wt~ ,p) is based on THE SENSITIVITY 
OF QUEUEING MODELS SIMULATION TO TIME DISCRETIZATION Lindley's (1952) integral equation for waiting time 
distributions. Given the density functions of the interarrival times (a) and the service times (s), if 
f(t) denotes the density function of the random variable (s-a), Lindley has shown that the steady-state 
waiting time distribution func-tion W(t) for a single-server queue is given by Itw(t-x) f(x)dx t > 0 
(7) W(t) : 0 t < 0 It is known that, except when p is close to 1, the distribution function W(t) usually 
increases very rapidly towards i as t increases initially, but it then converges very slowly to I as 
t becomes larger and W(t) becomes closer to i. For most practical purposes, instead of considering the 
entire domain (0, ~) for W(t) and the domain (-®, ~) for f(t), "sufficiently accurate" results can be 
obtained by truncating W(t)'s domain to (O,T) and f(t)'s domain to (-T,T), where T is sufficiently large 
such that W(T) ~ 1. At this value of T, if time exists in discrete units of (i.e., discreteness level 
=~), then by writing M : T/~, (8) and by defining w(t) to be the corresponding discrete density function 
of waiting time and d(t) to be the discretized counterpart of f(t), it can be seen that eqn. (7) transforms 
to the system of equations w(O) : w(O)d(O) + w(1)d(-l) + ... w(M)d(-M), (9) w(1) = w(O)d(1) + w(1)d(O) 
+ ... w(M)d(I-M), wiM) : w(O)d(M) + w(1)d(M-1) + ...w(M)diO), or equivalently, ~(0~ "d(O) d(-1) ... d(-M) 
//   ~iM~ LdiM) diM-l) . diO) wiM~ . Since one of the above M+I equations is redundant, the system 
can be solved by replacing the first equation with the probability relationship w(O) + (w(1) + ... + 
w(M) = 1, giving (I (1) d(O) d(1-11) w(1) (Ii) ill1 i w o 1 L (M) f(M-1) d(O) wiM U , or Eqn. (12) is 
in the form [K] = [D][w], hence [w] = [D]-I{K]. (13) Observing the elements in matrix [D] of eqn. (12) 
reveals that the matrix is diagonally dominant except for the first row, therefore, the waiting time 
density function [w] can be easily obtained by solving eqn. (13) using the standard Gauss-Seidel method. 
The elements d(k)'s required in matrix D can be obtained in two ways. First, if a convenient theoretical 
function of f(x) in eqn. (7) is available (e.g., when the service and interarrival times are both normally 
distributed, and hence f(x) is normal), then d(k) can be simply computed as the area under f(x) in the 
time interval {k~+ 0.5~), where~ is the dis- creteness level. Second, if f(x)'s function cannot be conveniently 
obtained, d(k) can be conputed by a "numerical convolution" procedure: L ~. s(i) a(i-k) for k > 0 i=k 
d(k) = (14) L+k s(i) a(i-k) for k < O, i=O where s(k) and a(k) are respectively the probabi-lities of 
the service and interarrival times being in the interval (k~ + 0.~ ), and L is a suitably large value 
greater than 2M. For modelling the discrete-time queuein] system, the only approximations made in eqn. 
(13) are the truncation of W(t)'s domain from (0, ~) to (O,T) in eqn. (8) and (9), and the truncation 
of the range of s and a from (0, ~) to (O,L~) in eqn. (14). To achieve the accuracies needed in this 
study, the computations were programmed in "triple precision," and the truncation levels are set to be 
high enough such that a(L) and s(L) are less than 10E-15 and w(M) is less than IOE-20 in each case. We 
found that this computational 7ethod performs adequately for low p and high discrete-ness levelz . When 
p is high, the long tail of W(t) necessitates a high truncation level T, and hence a larger M-value according 
to eqn. (8). When~ is low, both M and L have to be large for the same truncation levels T and L~ . In 
either case, the computations required to perform eqn. (14) and (13) become excessive. M: EXPERIMENTAL 
RESULTS 4.1 Exponentially Distributed Times The computational method is first used to compute [w] for 
discreteness levels of J.Z and 0.1; having [w], the values of W(~ ,p) and Aij t can be easily computed.

 time." Our computed values of Aij t ! s are all very small (< 0.1%), and no meaningful pattern can be 
detected. The computational method becomes inadequate for p > 0.3 or for% < 0.1, and simulation was used 
to study the cases of p =0.4 to 0.6. While reliable estimates of Dij I s magnitudes were not obtainable, 
the simulated values of dij I s do indicate the same consistent pattern: "a higher discreteness level 
leads to a slightly higher mean waiting time." For higher p-values, the sample observations from simulation 
become too erratic. 4:2 Normally Distributed Times Assuming normally distributed service and inter- arrival 
times, the computational procedure was used to determine values of W~ ,p) for the cases tabulated in 
Table II. The effect of time dis- creteness on the mean waiting time is again very small. For the cases 
below the line AA in Table II, the consistent direction of the time discrete- ness effect is: "a higher~ 
leads to a slightly higher mean waiting time," which agrees with the earlier observation. However, for 
cases above the line AA in Table II, the consistent direction of the time discreteness effect is in the 
opposite direction, i.e., "a higher~ leads to a slightly LOWER mean waiting time." The computed values 
of aijt ! s are again very small and no meaningful pattern can be observed. 4.3 Generalization Other 
distributions were also used to represent the interarrival and service times, and investiga- tions similar 
to the ones described in sections 4.1 and 4.2 were conducted. These results (many of them not presented 
here) clearly suggests the following generalization on the effect of title discreteness: When p and the 
coefficient of variation of the interarrival/service times are both small, a higher~ leads to a lower 
mean waiting time. When the combination of p and the coefficient of variation are "sufficiently large" 
(as indicated by the region to the right of AA in Table II), a higher~ leads to a higher mean waiting 
time. This generalization explains very well the observed patterns in Tables I and II. For exponentially 
distributed times (see Table I), a higher % : always leads to a higher mean waiting time because an experimental 
distribution always has a high coefficient of variation of I. 5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Investigations 
similar to the ones presented above were also conducted for queues with other distribution forms of interarrival/serv~ce 
times. The data reveal the same pattern of behavior depicted above, and are not presented. Ore would 
expect the effect of time discreteness to be small, since this probably has been the implicit justification 
for the lack of formal investigations on this issue. However, it is probably surprising to see how small 
the effect actually is. For example, considering situations in which the mean waiting times are sufficiently 
large (say, more than 10% of the mean service times) to be of practical interest, Table II indicates 
that very accurate estimates of W(O,p) can be obtained with W(O.2,p), i.e., using discrete time units 
as large as 20% of the mean interarrival ti~e. This leads to very useful answers to the questions raised 
in the first section of this paper. Perhaps the most promising implication is the suggestion of developing 
discrete-time queueing models that can be more easily solved than their Coeff. of Variation c.v =0.1

E-O THE SENSITIVITY OF QUEUEING MODELS SIMULATION TO TIME DISCRETIZATION continuous-time counterparts 
but are nearly as accurate. One example is the solution of Lindley's equation (eqn. 7) by the computation 
procedure presented in this paper. Analytical solution of eqn. (7) is known to be difficult for most 
practi- cal interarrival/service-time distributions. However, if the discreteness level ~ can be set 
at a large value, M will be small according to eqn. (8), and the discrete waiting time distribu- tion 
can be easily obtained through eqn. (14) and (13), using very little computer time; moreover, this computational 
procedure is applicable to all distribution forms of interarrival/service. The consistent effect of~ 
on the mean waiting time as generalized at the end of the preceding section is perhaps interesting academically, 
but we have no theoretical explanation for the ob- served behavior. Given the smallness of the effect, 
further investigations do not seem worth- while. Besides observing the mean waiting time, we have also 
observed in these investigations the effects of time discreteness on the waiting time distribu- tion 
itself and the standard deviation of waiting times, the effects are all negligible for practi- cal purposes, 
and are therefore not presented. REFERENCES APL/360 User's Manual, GH20-0683, IBM Corporation, White
