 Requirements for Access Control: US Healthcare Domain Konstantin Beznosov Baptist Health Systems of 
South Florida 6855 Red Road, Coral Gables, FL 33143 beznosovObaptisthealth.net The differences in the 
requirements of disclosing pa- tient information from state to state, the diversity in healthcare providers 
business models, the increased rate of merges, and the upcoming federal regulations in healthcare make 
access control requirements a mov- ing target for application developers and healthcare en- terprise 
designers and administrators. We suggest two major design principles for access control infrastructure 
deployed in the healthcare enterprises: isolation of the application logic from the authorization logic 
and cen- tralized administration of the authorization logic. Application systems and healthcare enterprises 
con- structed according to these two principles will be able to accommodate changes in access control 
logic and will enforce a uniform access control model across an enter- prise. However, the complexity 
and instability of the healthcare access control model makes the task of ap- plying these design principles 
somewhat difficult. The notion of roles and their hierarchies help to alleviate complexity of controlling 
access to patient data, but it has to be used in conjunction with other information, such as affiliation, 
relationship, location and so on. We identified the following factors that have to be used to make elaborate 
authorization decisions in order to comply with patient information discloser requirements: Affiliation 
-what subsidiary of the health system a particular caregiver works for. Due to frequent mergers and to 
the fact that many physicians consult in several hospitals, this factor affects the authorization decision. 
Role -what role the user is assigned to during the current session. This factor is important to use because 
the same user can act in different roles performing his or her responsibilities and pey,iilssion to snake

access control decreases security administration overhead. However, access control policies show us that 
the type of relationship between the user and the patient is used more frequently in making authorization 
decisions. Location -where the user is accessing information services from. Location information is used 
in several types of authorization rules. One type is represented by the following example of an access 
control policy: a nurse should have access to medical records of a patient if the nurse is currently 
working on the same floor as the patient. Another type uses location to identify the trust domain where 
the user is accessing information services from. A reasonable policy would deny access to any sensitive 
information to anyone accessing it from such areas. Location can also be used to derive the emergency 
level of access. A policy can allow read access to all patient information of all patients for any user 
assigned to the role physician and accessing the information from an emergency room. Time The time factor 
is useful for authorization rules on users assigned to shift-related positions such as nurses and for 
team-based access control. Relationship -what is the relationship between the user and the patient whose 
records are to be ac-cessed. Some types of relationships that need to be managed in the healthcare context 
are: patient s pri-mary care provider; admitting, attending, referring, or consulting physician of a 
particular patient; part of the patient care team; healthcare staff explicitly assigned to take care 
of the patient; patient s imme-diate family; patient s legal counsel or guard; per-sonal pastoral care 
provider. Roles are important factors in authorization rules. However, other information is essential 
in order to make authorization decisions at healthcare enterprises. An effective authorization language 
that would incorporate concepts of roles, affiliation, location, relationships and time is needed. 3rd
