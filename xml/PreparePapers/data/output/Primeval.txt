 Primeval contact: Gemma Samuell Framestore CFC gemma.samuell@framestore-cfc.com Primeval is a sci-fi 
TV drama serial, for which Framestore has produced a selection of photoreal CG creatures (both real and 
imaginary) that interact extensively with humans and environments, including supporting cast members. 
Over the serial s seven-episode run, our team supplied the production with seven new CG creatures (seen 
in some 350 shots) and 350 digital VFX and CG enhancements. Around 60 people worked over a period of 
nine months to bring the bestiary to life. The creature work was done entirely in Maya, rendered in Mental 
Ray, and composited in Shake. Challenges overcome included pipelining of the entire project in the same 
way a film would be created. The tool set we use for TV is now the same as the one we use on films, which 
offers our team the chance to draw on some of the in-house R&#38;D work that the film teams have built 
up over the years. Cast VFX Shoot Coordinators Animators lead TD Professor Nick Cutter Jon keene Alfonso
