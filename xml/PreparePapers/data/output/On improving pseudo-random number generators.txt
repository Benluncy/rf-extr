Memphis State University Memphis, TN 38152 ABSTRACT Some theoretical and empirical justifications for 
the combination generators are given, It is shown that adding enough random variates, whether or not 
they are independent, the fractional part of their sum will converge to a uniform distribution. Empirical 
study shows that combination generators can even trans­form some bad random generators into a much bet­ter 
one. 1 INTRODUCTION The ideal goal in generating random numbers is to find an algorithm that will generate 
truly random numbers. It is well-known, however, that truly ran­dom and independent variates cannot be 
computer generated using any algorithms. In fact , as observed by Park and Miller (1988), good uniform 
random number generators are hard to find and some of the popular generators display distinctly non-uniform 
characteristics. Unfortunately, most of the standard algorithms seem to have been proposed under the 
false assumption that they could produce truly uni­form random variates, when in fact some of them gen­crate 
pseudo-random numbers which are significantly non-random. Deng (1988) and Deng and Chhikara (1991) showed 
that inaccuracies in generated random numbers are invariably carried over and sometimes magnified when 
these numbers are transformed to produce variates of interest. Several improvements over the traditional 
congru­ential method have been proposed in the literature. Knuth (1981), Wichmann and Hill (1982), Marsaglia 
(1985), L Ecuyer (1988), Collins (1987), and Ander­son (1990) all suggested the use of the combination 
generator. Based on an hi~ empirical dudy on aev­eral popular generators, Marsaglia (1985) concluded 
that combination generators seemed to be the best generator. Some justifications are available for the 
combination generator, but all are based on some unrealistic assumptions. Horton (1948) and Horton NUMBER 
GENERATORS Yu-Chao Chu Department of Preventive Medicine University of Tennessee Memphis Memphis, TN 
38163 and Smith (1949) showed that the sum of several .. integer pseudo numbers modulo a positive integer 
M converges to a discrete uniform distribution over 0,1,2,... , M 1. Deng and George (1990) showed that 
the sums, modulo 1, of nearly uniform continu­ ous random variables were much more uniform than the individual 
variables. Brown and Solomon (1979), Marsaglia (1985) and L Ecuyer (1988) also provided some theoretical 
support for combination generators under the unrealistic assumption that individual gen­ erators were 
independent of each other. One of our major results in this paper is to re­move the independence assumption 
of the generated sequence. In section 2, conditions are given for the convergence of sum, modulo 1, of 
several lpossibly dependent random variables to a U(O, 1) variate. In section 3, we extend this result 
to a multidimensional case. We show that if each component of a sequence of continuous random vectors 
is stretched out , then the fractional part of the components will converge to independent uniform random 
variables. This theorem provides a simple method for generating a sequence of asymptotically independent 
U(O, 1) random vari­ ables. The result of an empirical study is presented in section 4. Simulation results 
show that the fractional part of a sum of dependent uniform random variables or non-uniform variates 
is quite close to U(O, 1), even for a sample size as small as 4. 2 ASYMPTOTIC UNIFORMITY Deng and George 
(1990) proves that the frac­tional part of a sum of two independent nearly uniform random variables 
produces a nearly uni­form random variable whose distribution is closer to a U(O, 1) than the parent 
distribution. Specifically, they proves the following theorem: Theorem. Let X1, X2,..., X. be n independent 
random variabJes distributed over [0, 1], with p. d.f. fk(zk), ~ = 1,2, ...n. Let U~ = ~#=lX~ mod 1, 
and jlrm(u) be the p.d.f. of U~. If lf~(z~) 115: c~,k = 1035 Deng, George and Ch u 1,2 ,..., n , then 
and n u. A u(o, 1), as rI ck-O. ksl The implication of this result is that one can gener­ate a much more 
uniform variate by taking the frac­tional sum of several nearly uniformly distributed variates, and aa 
will be seen in the empirical study re­ported in section 4, that the number of terms needed to achieve 
uniformity may be very small. However, aa we noted before, no computer-generated sequences can be safely 
assumed to be independent of each other. We will show next that the asymptotic unifor­mity result can 
be proved without the independence assumption. The following lemma gives a simple relationship between 
the p.d.f. of the fractional part of a ran­dom variable and the p.d.f. of the original random variable. 
 Lemma 2.1. Let Y be any continuous random variable with p.d.f fY (y). Then the p.d.fi of U = Y mod 1is 
given w fw=~fY( +m) ,O<u<l. m Proof. Denote the c.d.f. of U and Y as Fu(.) and FY (.), respectively. 
By the definition of U, we have FU(U) = ~P?@<Y<u+rn) = fi(FY(v+m) -FY(rn)), forO < u <1, m Lemma 2.1 
follows easily by taking derivative w.r.t. u on both sides. 0 The following lemma states that if a random 
se­quence converges to a U(O, 1) distribution, then adding any constant sequence an and then taking the 
fractional part will again converge to a U(O, 1) distribution. Lemma 2.2. Let {Un, n = 1,2, ...} be a 
sequence of continuous random variables such that the c.d.~ of Un, Fun(t) converges uniformly to the 
c.d.f of U(O, 1). Then for any sequence of constants {an, n = 1,2, ...}. we have Yn = (Un +an) mod 1~ 
U -I!7(0,1). Proof. Since Y. = [(un mod 1)+ (an mod 1)] mod 1, without loss of generality, we may assume 
O~a. <1 and O~Un <l. From the definition of Y., we have, for O ~ u <1, Pr(Yn ~ u) = Pr(O~Un +an<u)+Pr(ls 
Un+an Sl+u) FUn(l+u an) Fun(l an), ifu < an = Fu.(u an)+ [1 Fum(l an)], ifu > an { where Fum (.) is 
the c.d.f. of Un. Since U. ~ U(O, 1) and U. is continuous random variable, we have Fum (t) = t+ o(l), 
for all t E (O, 1). This implies that Pr(Yn ~ u) = u + 0(1)-u as n-+m.n Next, we will prove one of our 
key results. Theorem 2.1. Let {Zn, n = 1,2, ...} be a sequence of continuous random variables with p.d.f 
fzm (z). Suppose that the p.d.f of Z., fzn (z) converges uniformly to fz(z), where fz (z) is the p.d.f 
of a continuous random variable Z. Then for any se­quence of constants {(an, bn), n = 1,2, ...} such 
that li~-m b. = co, U. = (b.Z. +a. ) mod 1 ~ U(O,l) as n ace. Proof. From Lemma 2.2, Theorem 2.1 follows 
im­mediately if we can show that b.Z. mod 1~ U(O, 1) as n ~ cm. Without loss of generality, we may assume 
an = O. From Lemma 2.1, the p.d.f. of U. is given as fu. (u) = ~fbmzn(u + ~) = ;fz.(~)+ = ifz(~); + 0(1) 
nn m = fz(z)dz + o(1) J = 1+ 0(1)+1 as n + m. Hence by Scheff6 s theorem, bnZn + an mod 1 ~ U(o,1). 1 
Improving Random Number Generators Corollary 2.1. Let {Yn, n = 1,2,...} be a se­ quence of continuous 
random variables with p.d.f. fY. (Y). Wwose there exists a sequence of constants {(an, b~), n = 1,2, 
...} such that li~+m bn = OCI and the p.d.f. of Zn = (Yn an)/b. converges uni­formly to a p.d.f fz (z). 
Then Un=Ynmod l~U(O,l), asneoo. Proof. From Z. = (Yn an )/bn, we have Un = bnZn + an mod 1. Corollary 
2.1 follows directly from Theorem 2.1. 0 Corollary 2.2. Let Z be any continuous random variable with 
p.d.f. $2(z). Suppose there exists a se­quence of constants {(an, bn), n = 1,2, ...} such that li%-.+m 
b. = 00. Then U. = (b. Z+an) mod 1 ~ U(O, l) asn~co. A simple application of Corollary 2.1 is to take 
 Y. = ~;=l Xk. If one can find normalizing constants of Yn aa described in Corollary 2.1, then Y. mod 
1 = Z]=l Xk mod 1 &#38; iY(O, 1). No inde­pendence assumption among xk is required. In fact, even if 
all xk are identical, i.e. xk = X, we have ~~=1 X~ mod 1 = nX mod 1 ~ U(O, 1), accord­ing to Corollary 
2.2. There is a very simple explanation for the above theorem and its corollaries. If a continuous random 
variable is stretched far out (either by scaling or adding several random variates), then the stretched 
variate, such as Yn in Corollary 2.1 and bnZn + an in Theorem 2.1, should be (roughly speaking) uniformly 
distributed, within each subinterval [m, m + 1) for each integer m. Therefore U~ = Y~ mod 1 and U~ = 
(bnZn + an) mod 1 should converge to U(O, 1). An interesting and somewhat surprising interpre­tation 
of Corollary 2.2 is that the lower significant digits of any continuous random variable tends to be uniformly 
distributed. However, this observation is not directly applicable to pseud~random genera­tors because 
no generator is capable of generating a truly continuous variates. 3 ASYMPTOTIC INDEPENDENCE In this 
section, we will propose a method to gener­ate a sequence of uniform random variates which will be asymptotically 
uniform U(O, 1) distributed and asymptotically independent of each other. Lemma 3.1. Let (Yl, Y2) be 
any continuous random vector with the joint p.d.f, ~yl ,yz(yl, V2). Then the joint p.d.f of (Ul, iY2) 
= (Yl mod 1, Y2 mod 1) is given as f?A,u2(W, ~2) = ~~$Y,,Y2(% + ~,~2 + q, mi for O<t41, uz <l. Proof. 
The proof is similar to Lemma 2.1. H Theorem 3.1. Let {( Z1n, Z2n), n = 1,2, ...} be ase­quence of continuous 
random vectors with joint p.d.f fz,n,z,m(% , ~2). Suppose that fz,~,z,n (ZI, Z2) con­verges uniformly 
to fZ1 ,Z2 (ZI, 22), as n ~ CO, where fz,,z,(zl, .z2) is the joint p.d.f of a continuous ran­dom vector 
(Zl, Z2). Consider two sequences of con­stant pm rs {(ai~, b~~), n = 1, 2, ...}, i = 1,2, such that li%-.+m 
bin = co. Let U~n = (b~nZin + ai~) mod 1 i = 1,2, Then 1. Uin ~ .V(O,1), asn ~ co, for i= 1,2,,and 
2. Uln and U2n are asymptotically independent.  Proof. Part (1) is proved in the Theorem 2.1. To prove 
Part (2), we use Lemma 3.1. Without loss of generality, we may assume al. = O and a2n = O. The joint 
c.d.f., ~u,n,u,n(ul, w2), of (Ul~, U2~) is Hence, Uln and U2n are asymptotically independent. n Corollary 
3.1. Let {( Yl~, Y2n), n = 1,2, ..} be a sequence of continuous random vectors with p. d.f. fy,.,y,.(u, 
YZ). Swose there exists a sequence of constants {(ain, bin), n = 1, 2, ...}. i = 1, 2, such that li~+w 
bin = CO. Let Zin = (Yin ai~ )/bi~, i = 1,2. Suppose the joint p.d.f. of (Zln, Z2n) converges uniformly 
to a joint p.d.f. ~zl ,Zz(%1,22). Then 1. Ui~ = Yin mod 1 L U(O,l), :ISn ~ cm, fori = 1,2, and 2. Uln 
and U2n are asymptotically independent. Proof. From Z,. = (~. -sin)/bin, we have Uin = binZin + ain mod 
1. Corollary 3.1 follows directly from the above theorem. 0 Corollary 3.2. Let (ZI, 22) be any continuous 
ran­dom vector with joint p.d,f fz, ,z, (z1, 22). Suppose there exists a sequence of constants {(ain, 
bin), n = 1,2,...}, i = 1,2, such that li~-m bin = m. Let Uin be (binZi +ain) mod 1 for i = 1,2. Then 
1. Uin ~ U(O, 1), u n~ 00, for i= 1,2, and 2. UIn and Uz. are asymptotically independent.  Remarks: 
 1, It is straightforward to generalize the above re­sults (Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.1, 3.2) from 
two joint random variables to more than two random variables. The precise statements for higher dimensions 
will be therefore omitted. 2, Similar to section 2, one can give a intuitive ex­planation for the results 
proved in this section. If a continuous random vector is stretched far out (either by scaling or adding 
several ran­dom vectors) in all directions, then locally (within each dimension of the square of the 
par­tition) the stretched vector should be (roughly speaking) uniformly distributed in each coordi­nate 
and the components should be independent of each other. Let {Xi~, i = 1,2,... },k = 1,2,..., nbensequences 
of random variables representing n separate random number generators. Define n ~n =~xik, i= 1,2,... k=l 
Let Uin=~n mod 1. Under a very weak condition, it follows from Corol­lary 3,1 that each variate in the 
new sequence {Ui~, i = 1,2, ...} will follow approximately a uni­form distribution, U(O, 1), Furthermore, 
any two variates in the sequence Uiln and Uizn are asymp­totically independent, for any il # i2. The 
condition required is the existence of normalizing constants for Yi ~ n and Yi2n ss described in Corollary 
3.1. Note that this condition is certainly much weaker than the Deng, George and Chu usual requirements 
on normalizing constants needed from central limit theorems. No independence or fi­nite variance assumption 
is required. The removal of independence assumption of random sequence is of practical importance because 
no computer-generated sequence satisfies the independence assumption. As we have noted before, the previous 
discussion for ran­dom vector (Uiln, Ui2n ) can be easily extended to any higher dimensions. Hence, we 
have produced a se­quence of random variates which is approximately i.i.d. U(O,l) distributed. To make 
the previous discussion clearer, let us con­ sider the following diagram representing n random variate 
generator: 1st RNG Xll . . . X,ll . . . X,,l . . . 2nd RNG X12 . . . Xi,z . . . X,=z . . . . . . nth 
RNG Xln . . . Xil~ . . . Xi,n . . . ~~=1 xik Ylfl . . . Y,l~ . . . Yi,n . . . Mnmodl Uln . . . Ui,n . 
. . Ui=n . . . For simplicity, take il = 1 and i2 = 2. Accord­ing to Corollary 3.1, Uln -% U(O, 1) and 
U2n ~ U(o,1), M n + cm. Furthermore, Uln and U2n will be asymptotically independent as n gets larger. 
Note that neither between generators nor within gen­erator independence is assumed. The only required 
condition is the existence of normalizing constants for (Yl., Y2n) as described in Corollary 3.1. Using 
similar argument as above and the higher dimension extension of Theorem 3.1, we can see that the ran­dom 
sequence Uln, U2n, U3n... will be approximately i.i.d. U(O, 1), for large n. Wichmann and Hill (1982) 
proposes a portable random number generator by combining three multiplicative congruential generators 
{Xi, i = 1,2, ...}. {fi, i = 1,2, ...} and {Zj, i = 1,2, ...} as fol­lows Ui=Xi+x+Zimodl. This generator 
has a much longer period of gen­erating cycle than a single multiplicative method. However, Wichmann 
and Hill (1982) have not given any theoretical justification. The previous discussion (with n = 3) provides 
theoretical justifications for the uniformity as well as independence of the Ui s. The theorems in this 
section also suggest the follow­ing modification: Ui =blXi +b2~ +b3Zi mod 1, where bl, b2, b3 are some 
large numbers. The above generator will give good results even if (1) {Xi, i = 1,2,...}, {y, i = 1,2, 
...} and {Zi, i = 1,2, ...} were Improving Random Number Generators 1039 bad generators and/or (2) three

statistics greater than the chi-square table value is 100 percent in every case generated. However, our 
proposed transformation (both Y or Z) will yield random sequence whose distribution is very close to 
i.i.d. U(O,l) distribution. The percentage of the computed chi-square statistics greater than the chi­square 
table value is very close to its nominal value. 5 CONCLUDING REMARKS We have provided some theoretical 
justifications for the asymptotic uniformity and asymptotic inde­pendence of the combination generators 
without the usual assumption of independence of the generators. Theorems in this paper also give us a 
general method of transforming a possibly bad generator into a much better generator which will yield 
an asymptotically independent and uniformly distributed random se­quence. Our empirical study demonstrates 
that only a small number of terms is required in our asymp­totic theory to achieve a much more uniform 
random sequence. As pointed out in Park and Miller (1988), some generators provided by certain computer 
sys­tem may not be very random . Combining several generators into a single generator will provide some 
protection against the possibility of bad system­provided generators. Since uniform variate genera­tion 
is the key to generating other commonly used probability distributions, these results should be use­ful 
in many applications. REFERENCES Anderson, S. L. 1990. Random number generators on vector supercomputers
