AMP+AKZO Company PO Box 700 West Lane Aqueboque, NY 11931 ABSTRACT The AMP-AKZO Riverhead Circuits Division 
is responsible for manufacturing printed circuit boards. Scheduling problems have resulted from both 
physical and operating constraints. The AMP-AKZO PROVISA Scheduling System (APSS) was developed to better 
manage order due-date and plant throughput performance. The fully integrated system is made up of the 
Production Control Inventory System (PCIS), and the PROVISA scheduling system. The APSS automates the 
majority of routine scheduling decisions, and provides capabilities to recover from unplanned events, 
such as machine breakdowns. Furthermore, the system provides what-if analysis capabilities to test scheduling 
alternatives and opportunities. The APSS is capable of forecasting very accurate schedules and can be 
used as a continuous improvement tool. Since released to production in February 1994, the scheduling 
system has improved the company s overall scheduling effectiveness. Consequently, AMP-AKZO has reported 
an increase in both order due-date and plant throughput performance. 1 DEFINED SCHEDULING PROBLEM Scheduling 
problems resulted from several compounding factors. 80% of the cwstomer deliyery requirements change 
in a one week time period. Due to this high rate of change in customer demand, an enormous amount of 
Michael C. Cheselka AT&#38;T ISTEL Visual Interactive Systems Inc. 25800 Science Park Drive Beachwood, 
OH 44122 work in process (WIP) was placed on the floor to help buffer the chum in the order requirements. 
This high level in WIP has lead to long manufacturing cycle times. Compounding the problem is the fact 
that there are more than 125 different process flows that lead to a wide variety of end product features. 
Because of the different process routings it was impossible to accurately project work center schedules 
for all of the 15 process areas for greater than a 16 hour period. These issues resulted in inaccurate 
projections as to when product would be completed and available for shipment. As a result AMP-AKZO Riverhead 
Circuits decided that a finite scheduler would allow us to address all of the issues and improve our 
delivery performance to our customers. 2 PLANT BACKGROUND The load on the AMP+AKZO Riverhead Division 
is defined by the number of panels released daily from material issue, This load varies from day to day, 
which can be attributed to the actual order mix of incoming lots, and other economic factors. Typically, 
AMP+AKZO receives several new orders pex week. The plant maintains 61 thousand of panels in WIP, and 
processes 45 hundred of panels per day. 2.1 Scheduled Opemtions There are approximately 125 different 
part routings scheduled at the AMP+AKZO Riverhead Division. As customers change part specifications, 
the actual number of routings will vary over time. 1013 Flower and Cheselka PUMCE -+B 0  @-- EEEt+EEt+

 3 PROJECT GOALS The mission of the project was to increase on-time delivery performance to a world 
class manufacturing level, such that the AMP-AKZO Company can diversify its business to increase total 
revenue and profitability. 3.1 Project Objectives The AMP+AKZO PROVISA Scheduling System was designed 
to achieve the following objectives: * To accurately set promise due dates in the Production Control 
Inventory System. * To automate the majority of routine shop floor scheduling decisions consistent with 
all operating constraints, rules and objectives. * To provide decision support capabilities relative 
to exceptions. For example, machine breakdowns, rush orders, etc. * To extend the scheduling horizon 
to several weeks so that a comprehensive strategy for all orders is generated. * To provide additional 
information to anticipate scheduling problems and Opportunities. Concurrently, to provide simulation-based 
what-if analysis and continuous improvement capabilities to evaluate scheduling alternatives.  4 SYSTEM 
DESCRIPTION The AMP+AKZO PROVISA Scheduling System is comprised of two main modules: * PCIS Data Collection 
Program * PROVISA Scheduling System Finite Capacity Scheduling System I NEW ORcERs AMP-PJ(ZO PROWSASCHEWUNG 
SYSTEM I S-WFKC4? STATUS Figure 2: System Overview The PCIS is responsible for managing all AMP+AKZO 
Riverhead orders. This includes adding new, maintaining existing, and removing old orders from the PCIS 
database. In addition, the PCIS is responsible for tracking all work-in-process and shop floor status. 
On a daily basis, raw PCIS data is acquired and formatted by the data collection program. The PROVISA 
data is then transferred to the PROVISA scheduler. Once updated, PROVISA uses simulation­based finite 
capacity technology to generate the shop floor schedules. The schedules are fine tuned and distributed 
to the shop floor for execution. Figure 1 shows an overview of the APSS and the cyclic nature of the 
system, 4.1 System Data Flow ? -- -w .W ( \- A l.J-uL / --\ w -- Figure 3: APSS High Level Data Flow 
The data flow diagram, shown above in Figure 2, illustrates the basic APSS functionality and data relationships. 
Structured Data Analysis notation is used where the bubbles represent system functions or actions, and 
the horizontal bars represent data stores. The arrows indicate the data flow between functions and data 
stores. The PCIS database (DB) is a combination between AMP+AKZO S current orders, and shop floor status 
information. Firm orders, WIP, and shop floor status information is pulled from the PCIS DB daily or 
as needed by the scheduler. The order information is formatted to the required PROVISA OHFDATA file specification, 
and the shop floor status and WIP data is formatted using the TUFDATA file specification. Next, the files 
are imported into the PROVISA DB, This is accomplished by first deleting all the old PROVISA orders and 
shop floor status data, and then loading then new information. Using the PROVISA model validation facility, 
the user checks for potential data problems to ensure total scheduling accuracy. If a data integrity 
problem is identified, the conflict is resolved before invoking the PROVISA scheduler. Potential data 
integrity problems are: * A referenced shop floor work order not found in the OHFDATA file, * An order 
in the OHFDATA file with missing key information. * A new part routing not found in the part routing 
definition file. Once the PROVISA database is validated, a first pass schedule is generated, Model output 
reports include: * Department schedules * Order lateness report * Simulation statistics All the output 
reports, along with Ihe PROVISA planning board, are used to review the quality of the current schedule. 
The planning board is a graphical display of the generated schedule in a Gantt chart-like layout. For 
evaluating multiple scheduling scenarios, the PROVISA comparison module is used to graphically compare 
key scheduling parameters such as: * On-time delivery performance + Utilization of key equipment * Cost 
of the schedule, etc. Flower and Cheselka Scheduling with the APSS can be an iterative process. A schedule 
is generated, reviewed, and then if needed, fine tuned, Schedule fine tuning is done by adjusting principle 
model parameters, such as: * Rules and rule parameters * Planning horizon * Work patterns * Resources 
* Machine efficiencies This process is repeated until the best possible schedule is generated, and the 
schedules are issued to the shop floor for execution. 5 MODELING APPROACH The approach taken in implementing 
the APSS was to create a model of the Riverhead Circuits operation that mimicked the manufacturing process 
as closely as possible. In doing so there are several key elements that needed to be defined. They are: 
* Customer Orders * Work Units * Resources *  Part Routings * Shop Floor Data * Resource time availability 
 The objective of the model is to establish schedules for each of the work centers that can be used to 
achieve the best on time delivery performance possible. The models can be run as many times as desired 
by the scheduler in order to try different scenarios that will result in optimal results. These what­if 
scenarios can analyze changes in resource availability, the impact in expediting specific jobs on the 
entire schedule, and testing different priority rules that sort the order in which jobs are to be processed. 
Accurate representation of the factory elements is key to the generation of realistic schedules. PROVISA 
is a flexible modeling software package that will allow most processes to be defined quickly and easily. 
In the case of the APSS these elements were populated with information that best described the process 
as it is today. In developing the model for the APSS we decided that instead of developing part routings 
for each individual part we would instead create generic parts that specify a specific routing and then 
have an order defined as this generic part and provide additional information as to the specific customer 
part number by use of the order user field. This approach as resulted in 125 generic routings and part 
numbers. This reduced the number of part numbers for the APSS by more than 200, and it also help to prevent 
5 -10 new customer parts numbers that are created each week. Each customer part number is described in 
a 12 digit operation process code that is used to describe the unique characteristics of each part. In 
examining this process code we realized the only 7 digits described unique operations, with the other 
5 only being minor variations on common process. This resulted in identi~ing a part from PCIS and converting 
it into the following format: Table 1: PCIS Part Identification Table 2: APSS Part Identification An 
order user field as attached to each APSS order that carried the information from PCIS so it was very 
easy to cross reference between the two systems. The APSS part identification system is the critical 
means of verifiing the identity of both the part type and the routing. The process routes were developed 
from the part numbers in that each position in the part number represented a unique operation m a specific 
work group, center or station. The part routings were then developed to follow the exact manufacturing 
process that is prescribed in the PCIS operation sheet program. The key to the success of using this 
format is that the Process Code establishes,not only the part number, but the part routings is correct. 
If the process code does not match the actual part routings and the Finite Capacity Scheduling System 
operation sheet on the factory floor, the APSS will not run. In the start-up process of the APSS we found 
that the creating the logic of the simulation was only 20 %. of the total project time, the other 80V0 
was spent correcting bad information currently resident on the PCIS. 6 SCHEDULING LOGIC Developing good 
sort rules is the means to implementing a successful simulation project. Historically at AMP+AKZO, Production 
Control has established the master schedule, and the work group supervisors have generated the detailed 
schedules for their individual departments. For most cases this has been effective, however some delivery 
dates have been missed because of a emphasis on throughput, and not due date performance. This philosophy 
of meeting the production throughput requirements had merit, however, at the same time the scheduler 
can use the APSS as a tool to show why some days throughput requirements may not be as great as other 
days depending upon the actual cycle time of a particular order. The APSS also gives the supervisor a 
detailed schedule for the work group that helshe can fulfill and be measured against. The APSS uses several 
different sorting procedures. Jobs that are considered hot, either because of their due date requirement 
or because of new part or special process receive a priority code of 1. In the BA SICSORT rule logic, 
all jobs with a priority code of less than 20 would be processed first in order of their due date. After 
all the hot jobs had been completed, jobs would the be sorted by the operation float time, (the value 
of the operation due time minus the average setup time plus the cycle time). The drilling department 
sort rules were fairly complicated. Although all orders were routed to the same group, stations within 
the group were only capable of handling specific product. Rules were developed to look at the type of 
material that was to be drilled, the time for each drill cycle, and the size of the panels to be drilled. 
Rejection logic was the applied to insure that the correct orders could only be drilled on appropriate 
machines. MARKV VARIABLE { HOTLIST NUMBER ; Hot List Priority Code }.**** ********************** ***;**

>= 3 and this_op_number != 700) return (400000 + order_due_timeo) else return order_due_timeo + 100000 
endif endif endif endif endif } In the imaging areas it was important that setups be minimized. As a 
result, sort logic was developed to group similar part numbers together to minimize set ups. This was 
done only within a certain operation due date window in order not to impact overall due date performance 
of other jobs. The plating process was also unique, in that certain jobs could not be put into work if 
the current day was between Thursday and Sunday. This product could only be produced during the week 
day when the process was guaranteed to run continuously. PLATESORT VARIABLES { HOTLIST NUMBER ; Hot Lkt

the simulation was run and schedules were developed. These schedules were scrutinized by the work group 
supervisors, and with their feed back the scheduling methodology was improved. 7 MAJOR BENEFITS The benefits 
of the APSS are numerous. The most important benefit is the ability to generate realistic schedules that 
accurately predict department workload, and order completion dates. This has resulted in better on time 
delivery performance. With the constant changes in the release requirement from our customers we can 
now quickly see the impact of the changes and accurately respond to the customer as to how we can meet 
these new requirements. This system has also allowed AMP+AKZO Riverhead Circuits to reduce the amount 
of work in process (WIP). The APSS schedules work to be released according to the operation float time 
of a particular order. This has allowed us to release the job on a specific day with a predicted cycle 
time, instead of releasing the job several days early and hoping it will be completed on time. In the 
first month of operation we have achieved the following results. Table 3: Project Results . .......................

i Ontime deliverv ! 90 %0 : 98% i The impact on the shop floor has been dramatic. Schedules were constantly 
being changed as new orders were coming into a work center. Now with the APSS, the work group sees exactly 
what will be arriving into the area over the next several days, and at what times. This allows ample 
time to order any tools that may be necessary to run the job. This has resulted in a reduction of confusion 
and lost time. The impact on the Production Control department has been dramatic as well. In the past 
it would take at least 24 -48 hours to understand the impact of customer order changes. It was then just 
a guess as to how well the shop could respond to these changes, and what effect these changes had on 
other orders that were already in work. Now with the APSS it takes less than 2 hours to fully understand 
the impact of the changes and be able to respond to the customer with anticipated delivery dates. This 
2 hour process includes 1 hour for transferring the data from the PCIS to PROVISA, and the to run the 
simulation. The second hour is spent analyzing the data, and making any minor changes to the schedule 
that may be needed, and the finally releasing schedules to the individual work centers. From the sales 
side of the business, more accurate decisions can be made as to whether a rush order should be taken, 
and what impact it will have on other work that is already promised. The salesperson can now decide whether 
a premium should be charged for a rush order. Additionally we can see if the request date can be met, 
if other jobs will become late as a result, and the financial impact to the company. These intelligent 
decisions were never able to be made in the past, and they were done strictly on an instinctive level. 
The final benefit is that the APSS has forced that data in PCIS to become more accurate. In the past 
the impact of inaccurate data was difficult to measure. Because data integrity is the key to successful 
simulations, it has forced AMP+AKZO Riverhead Circuits to become more disciplined in its information 
and operating systems. 8 CONCLUSION AMP+AKZO Riverhead Circuits is a contract manufacturer of printed 
circuit boards. In the past Riverhead Circuits has suffered from poor delivery performance, and long 
cycle time. The inability to generate a reliable schedule was the major cause of these problems. As a 
result AMP+AKZO Riverhead Circuits decided that a finite capacity scheduling simulation package would 
improve the manufacturing performance. The system chosen was PROVISA from AT&#38;T ISTEL. The AMP+AKZO 
PROVISA Scheduling System was developed to create schedules to better manage order due-date and plant 
performance. The system imports information from the existing shop floor control system, and then simulates 
the manufacturing process to determine projected order delivery dates. The APSS also provides what-it 
capabilities to test the impact of order changes, machine breakdowns, and any other unexpected event. 
The project goals set for the APSS have been realized. On time delivery performance has improved, WIP 
has been reduced, and cycle times have been shortened. Schedules are now generated on a routine Finite 
Capacity Scheduling System 1019 basis for each work center that provide the supervisor with what is reasonably 
expected to be produced in a given time frame. REFERENCES Flower, IvLA. 1993. A n Evaluation of How to
