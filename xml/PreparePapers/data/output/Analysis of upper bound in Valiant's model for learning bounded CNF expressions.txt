Imluctive Learn@ can bedetined asaproceas ofacquihg knowledge by drawing inductive infercmce from teacher 
m environmau-provided facts [9]. This proceaa rnvolves opembna of gendking, transfo-Correcting, and refining 
knowledge representations in order to ammmmde given f@s and satisfy various additional criteria. bamting 
* examples is aprocess bywhich tkleamerinducca agenezal concept description fhm the given set of examplca 
and (optionally) counter-examples. . Although b nction of a ~ study of machine learning has beutexiadng

rntheformalrnodels of machirw laming known as computational learning theory [5]. According to Keams, 
the following be feature3 of Valiant s mdel have made this approach more realistic in terms of irnplementadonof 
this algorithm. (l)'I'bdanand thataleaming algorithm idemifythehiddem Wget rule exactly is relaxed to

Boolean forrnuke are often used as reprcmntdon for concepts [16]. A Booleau formula can be interpreted 
as s mapping from objects (aaaQnmmts) into {0, 1). If the formula takes onavalue lforatobjec~ tbtttheobj~isa 
positive cratnpk of the concept represented by the fornt~ otherwise it is a negative e.xa@e. Formally, 
an example for aconcept~ is a pair e,f(x~, wherex X, f(x) E {O, 1}. If f(x) = 1, Cxf(x* is a positive 
examp~ eke it is negative example. A finite sequace of such kbekd examples, viz., -1, f (Xlp, aa f(xJ>, 
. , -., f(xm)>, is termed as the sanyde set. In the case where all labels j (xj) are 1 (0), the labels 
are omitted and the sample set is simply writtem as a list of points x~,x~ ..4 ,h, sndthis aampkis calkd 
apositive sau@e (negative saqolk ). We say that a repsentation of a concepL g, and an example -, f(x)> 
agree ifg(x) = f(x~ otherwke they di.wgree. A refxesentation g and a sample S are c-em if g agrees with 
every example m S; othezwiae they are inconfisfenf. lx I denotes the length of the ve4tor, i.e., the 
number of attriites represented by that v~tor. It is obvims that for a set of n vatiabks tlwe are ~ pmible 
vectors. Thus concept can be tlmught of as a subset of tbae 2 possible vectors. overal~ a ~ class over 
x can be defined aaapair (es, C)wkem@+C, Ce(O, l). (fldatotes the power set of X). Vallant s PACLearningModel 
valiant s model operates on the following kamework. Itte concept to be kanted ~ the algorithm is called 
the target concept or target represmtdbt. Exampks of the target representation are gtmrated phbihkd y 
as follow Let D+ be a fixed but arbitrary @ability dism-over all positive examples, and let 1)-be a tied 
but mbitrafy ~obabfity distribution over all negative examples. Tbse distributionsare calkd the targU 
distributions. When learning the target ~ learning algorithms are given access to two kinda of information 
su@y. flte tit is a black-bx named EXAMPLE with two buttons labeled K3Sand NEG. If POS@EG)is -apositive 
(negative) example is generated acmrdng to the @mbiMy distrilmtion D+ (D-). There are no asmm@om made 
on these distributions exoept that D+(?) = O for d negative 755 example ~, and D @) =O fa each positive 
example P. Therefore ,~,D+@ )= 1, and ~ D-(x )= 1. Hence Valiant s nmdel is Iasttak as the Aion-fre modeh

A Note on Errors It is unmmnable to expect the ksrner to karn perfectly (100% accurate) all k time (100% 
of the dine), unkss the unkmwn concept is exhaustively atumaated. since k exampleshere are &#38;aunt

that the algorithm will learn with probabilky (1 -8-1) and that the kamed appsoximatiat to the unhnvn 
concept will ccrrectly classify with @abilky (1 -~-]). In oh words, tie algorithm is to learn with accumy 
(1 -~-]) ad confidence(1 -6-1).Some audtors choose to use two such error parameters to control the confidenceand
