 THE MAPEDIT SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC MAP DIGITIZATION by H. H. Holmes, D.M. Austin and W. H.  A system 
for the automatic digitization of polygon boundaries is described. Digitized map files are created from 
a driver tape containing identification codes and approximate centroids of polygonal boundaries (e.g., 
census tracts), and a film image of the map. The digitizer scans on the film plane in an automatic line-followingmode, 
producing the first stage of the map file for the editing system. The MAPEDIT system, which can be used 
either interactivelyor inbatch mode, reads maps in several standard formats and provides for combining 
and selecting maps by census (or other) geocodes or by longitude and latitude. This system provides several 
stages of data compression, analysis, and verification, including algorithms for detecting straight lines, 
finding corners, fitting insets of maps together and matching boundÂ­aries common to a pair of polygons. 
Auxiliary programs (1)provide a very high resolution (1part in 25,000) C.R.T. plot of the map, (2)allow 
a detailed examination and editing of the map and (3) supply missing geocodes using auxiliary tapes 
such as the Medlist tapes. Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work or
