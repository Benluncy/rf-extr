 Fitting a set of points by a circle Jestis Garcfa-L6pezt Pedro A. Ramos* Abstract 1 Introduction Given 
a set of points S = {pi,...,pn} in the euclidean d-dimensional space, we address the problem of computing 
the d-dimensional annulus of smallest width containing the set. We give a complete characterization of 
the centers of annuli which are locally minimal in arbitrary dimension and we show that, for d = 2, a 
locally minimal annulus has two points on the inner circle and two points on the outer circle that interlace 
angle-wise as seen from the center of the annulus. Using this characterization, we show that, given a 
circular or­der of the points, there is at most one locally min­imal annulus consistent with that order 
and it can be computed in time O(n log n) using a simple al­gorithm: it involves the computation of furthest 
and closest point Voronoi diagrams and a prune­and-search in the former one. tDpto. Matem&#38;tica Aplicada,

S={pl, ... , pn} beaset ofn points in~ and let d(z, y) denote the euclidean distance between points z 
and y. If we denote by F the family of hyper-spheres in ~, the problem of finding the optimal Tchebyshev 
fit of S with a hyper-sphere can be formulated as a min-max problem, that is, finding ~~~ ~=~,~,n d(p;, 
~) . The problem can be formulated in a more geomet­ric setting in the following way: we shall call 
d­annulus with center at c, inner radius r and outer radius 1?, denoted A(c, r, R), to the locus of points 
between two concentric spheres of radius r and R, that is, A(c, r, R)={zcll@ lr~d(z, c) <R}. The width 
of the annulus is w = R r and the problem that we address here is to compute the an­nulus of smallest 
width containing the set S. If we define the function %i?.s(z) as the difference of dis­tances between 
the furthest and the closest neigh­bor of z in S, we say that an annulus is locally minimal if its center 
is a local minimum of 7?s (z) and the problem of finding the annulus of smallest width containing the 
set of points is equivalent to finding the global minimum of Rs(z). The main motivation for this problem 
comes from Computational Metrology. Given an object that has to be tested for circularity (d = 2), take 
a sample of points from the object and measure the circularity of this sanlple set; then accept the ob­ject 
if the circularity is good enough and reject oth­erwise. The measure for circularity recommended by international 
standards is the width of the an­nulus of smallest width containing 5 (see [5, pp. 40 42]). Further information 
about the relation between Computational Geometry and Metrology can be found in [13]. A related concept 
is the width of a set, defined as the width of the thinnest slab containing the set. We shall see that 
in some situations (that will be characterized) there is no annulus of smallest width because there is 
a slab (region between two parallel lines) of smaller width than any annulus containing S and there is 
an infinite number of annulus which width converges to the width of the slab. We shall include th is 
case into the general one by considering a slab as an annulus with center at ccl. The problem of computing 
the annulus of small­est width containing atset of points has been exten­ sively studied in the Computational 
Geometry lit­erature. Up to our knowledge, the first non-trivial algorithm is due to Ebara et al. [3] 
~ where it is claimed that the center of the annulus is either an intersection of an edge of the closest 
point Voronoi diagram with an edge of the furthest point Voronoi diagram, either a vertex of one of these 
Voronoi di­agrams, leading to an algorithm which complexity is 0(n2). This characterization of the center 
of the annulus is used by Agarwal et al. [1] in or­der to give an 0(n8/5+ ) algorithm which is the unique 
O(nz) algorithm for solving this problem. This algorithm uses parametric search and other sophisticated 
programming techniques. Smid and Janardan [11] give a proof of that condition for the center of the annulus 
and point out that the opti­mal annulus can be a slab. The equivalent problem for simpIe polygons has 
been studied by Le and Lee [6] and has been solved in optimal O(n) time for the special case of convex 
polygons by Swanson et al. [12]. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a point to be the center 
of a locally minimal annulus in IEd which, when restricted to the planar case, show that there are always 
two points on the outer circle and two points on the inner circle of the an­ nulus (thus the center is 
always an intersection of an edge of the closest point Voronoi diagram with an edge of the furthest point 
Voronoi diagram) and the points on the boundary interlace angl~wise as seen from the center of the annulus. 
Moreover, in Section 4 we will see that this characterization has important implications on the distribution 
of lo­cal minima for configurations of points arising in practice (namely, when the angular order of 
the points around the center of the annulus is known). We shall see that in the region where the circular 
order of S does not change, there is at most one local minimum, which can be computed, using a simple 
algorithm, in O (n log n) time. Before going on, we state the formal definitions and introduce some notation 
in the next section.  2 Preliminaries Let S = {pl ,.. . ,P~} be a set of points in I@. The convex hull 
of S will be denoted conv S and VC(S) and Vf(S) will denote the closest and fur­thest point Voronoi diagram 
of S, respectively. Given a point z c @, CN(X) and FN(z) will denote, respectively, the set of closest 
and furthest neighbors of z in S, that is, Then, the roundness function can be defined in the following 
way: Rs(z) = (l(z, FN(Z)) -d(z, civ(z)). The problem of computing the annulus of smallest width containing 
S is equivalent to the problem of finding the global minimum of X!~(Z). The special case where the annulus 
of minimum width is a slab could be included into the general one by extending the definition of R.s(z) 
to the real projective o!­space, P~R. We recall that P % can be obtained by adding to Rid a point at 
oo for each family of parallel lines. Given a point z 6 PdR \ IRd, we define Rs(z) as the limit, when 
y goes to w along a line of the corresponding family, of 72s(y). Clearly, this limit does not depend 
on the line and the value is the distance between the supporting hyperplanes of S orthogonal to the family 
of lines. If p, q E I@, p~ will denote the vector from p to q and, as usual, we shall identify point 
p and vector o~ (for a fixed point o). The euclidean scalar product is denoted ii. ii and /ltil[ = (ti. 
Z)l/2 is the length of the vector. We shall call k-plane and k-sphere to a plane and a sphere of dimension 
k and the unit k-sphere will be denoted Sk. If S is included in a (d I)-sphere the global minimun of 
Rs(z) is zero. This property can be checked in linear time so, from now on, we are going to exclude this 
case from our study. Characterizing local minima of 7?S(X) The following lemma, which proof follows 
easily from Taylor expansion, will be useful later: Lemma 1 Let p ElR~,UE Sal-l and let CYpthe angle 
determined by o% and G. Then A2 sin2 aP d(~ti, p) = d(o, f?) ~ COSCYP + 2 d(o,p) 0(A2) Next result 
gives a complete characterization of the local minima of %ts(z) in arbitrary dimension. In what follows, 
we assume that Z. is the origin of the coordinate system, and vector x~p will be denoted $. Theorem 1 
XO is a local minimum of R.s(z) ij, and only if, V E E Sal-l Proof: For a given 0 E S 1, let pC(7) denote 
the point of CN (zo) that minimizes the angle between u and pi for pi E CN(ZO) and let ~C(~) be that 
angle, that is! In a similar way, pf[O is the point of FN(zo) that maximizes the angle between F and 
@i for pi < FN(ZO) and let af(o) be that angle, that is, Then, condition (1) says that vGEsd-l, Cos @f(J) 
< cm ac(ii) . (2) Using Lemma 1, it can be easily shown that, for A > 0 small enough, pC(O E L N(zO 
+ ~i7) and pf(O G FIV (z. + AU) and, from Taylor expansion, it follows that Rs(xo + Ao ) = %(zo) + A 
(Coscrc(;) Cosaf(q) AZ (sin2 af(~ in: ac(o + 0(A2). +~ IIFf(qll -llPc(qll ) Therefore, if condition 
(1) holds, we have cos aC(O cos af(;) > 0 for all U < Sal-l and Z. is a local minimum. Conversely, if 
there exists ;< S +1such that cos ~j(~ ~ cos Q c(;), ~S(*) decreases in that direction and Z. is not 
a local minimum. 1 It is worth noticing that condition (1) can be stated in a more geometric setting: 
it is equiva­lent to say that there does not exist a circular cone C with apex at Z. separating points 
of C lV (zo) and FIV (zo). We say that a cone C separates two sets of points if the interior and exterior 
of C in­clude only points of one of the sets. Observing that the intersection of such a cone with a hy­persphere 
is a (d 2)-sphere, condition (1) can also be stated saying that, if we project points of CJJ(ZO) and 
F iV(zo) onto a common sphere cen­tered at Zo, then projections of points of CJV (zo) cannot be separated 
from projections of points of FJV(ZO) by a hyperplane. Again, we say that a hyperplane separates two 
sets of points if the two open half-spaces determinate by the hyperplane include only points of one of 
the sets. We also observe that condition (1) implies that ICN(ZO)I + IF N(zO)I > d+ 2. To see this, we 
observe that, given two sets R and B in I@ with IRI+ 1131~ d+ 1, they can be separated by an Figure 1: 
??s(z) can have Q(n) local minima. hyperplane (this is easy to prove, using induction on d). Finally, 
we point out that condition (1) implies lCN(ZO)\ >1 and lFiV(ZO)\ >1. For d = 2, this is also equivalent 
to say that there are two points on the outer circle and two points on the inner circle of the annulus 
that interlace angle-wise as seen from the center of the annulus. This characterization of local minima 
of X?s(z) raises the open problem of determining the number of local minima that 7?s(z) can have in the 
worst case. If we restrict ourselves to the two dimensional case, it was conjectured in previous works 
[1, 11] that Rs(x) can have as much as fl(nz) local min­ima because VC(S) and Vf (S) can have a quadratic 
number of intersections (even for sets of points in convex position). Up to our knowledge, if we take 
into account the angular condition, there are no Figure 2: For a set of points in convex position, conv 
S~ ker S.  4 Roundness in the plane Let S={pI,... , f%} m or~ere~set of points in the plane. We define 
the kernel of S, denoted ker S, as the locus of points where points of S are seen in the orderpl, . . 
. ,pn. Hereafter, we assume that points are ordered in positive direction (counterclockwise) and that 
indices are modulus n. We observe that, if points are in convex position, conv S ~ ker Sas shown in Figure 
2 where ker S is shaded. Suppose that ker S#0 and consider the polygon P defined by the sequence of vertices 
PI, P2. ... ?%, P1. If P is a simple polygon then ker S isa star-shaped polygon and can be ob­tained 
as the intersection of the kernel of vertices of conv S with the half-planes defined by two con­secutive 
points of S such that at least one of the points is not a vertex of conv S. If P is not a simple polygon 
there is an edge e of P such that P\ e is a simple chain and ker S is a convex poly­gon. The intersection 
of ker S with an arbitrary line has at most two connected components and, in this case, the line does 
not intersect conv S (thus, it intersects two ears of ker S). examples in the literature giving a lower 
bound for the number of local minima of %i!,s(z). Figure 1 gives an example of a configuration of points 
with Q(n) local minima. Actually, all this minima are on the same edge of the furthest point Voronoi 
di­agram, and all of them can be global minima of the function. However, it is not clear at all how this 
construction can be iterated and provide an example with more than a linear number of local minima. Therefore, 
the number of local minima that 72s(z) can have in the worst case is Q(n) and 0(n2) and there is a wide 
gap for future work. Theorem 2 Inside ker S there is at most one lo­cal rninirnurn of 72s (z). Proofi 
Assume that Z. E ker S is a local mini mum of l?s(z). We are going to see that for an arbitrary U E S1, 
there is no other local minimum on the half-line Z. + Ati, J > 0. Without loss of generality, we can 
assume that Z. is the origin of the coordinate system and 17points toward the positive OX axis. In what 
follows, we assume that CN(ZO) = {Pi, Pj} and ~~(zo) = {p~, Pi}. If this is not the case, the same arguments 
can be made choosing two points on each subset that satisfy the angular condition. Assume also that /

let us define We claim that, if U. ~h ~ O then for every ~ >0, ~N(~?J ) 11c(~h) = @ and CN(AU) C C(pk) 
and, therefore, there cannot be any other local min­imum as long as the angular order is the same asinxo=o. 
To prove the claim, observe that, if9EC(pk) ns then Ilrll < ll~hlland, because ;. flk ~ O, it holds IIFII(IIFII 
-2J%; ) ~ llEkll(ilPhll-2A-) and therefore ll~ti-@112< ll~ti-~hllz, and q@ FN(Ai7). Using a similar 
argument, it can be shown that CN(A7) C C(pk) for every ~ >0 because, in this case, ifqE S and <$ C(pk), 
we have that and therefore l[Ati-fill < 11A?7-Fly. Suppose now that U -~, > 0. Let (x;, y;) the coordinates 
of point pi. We consider separately the caseswhen x;~xhand ~;<Zh. Ifx; ~Zhit can be shown that we have, 
as before, that CN(~U) C C.(pk) and FN(Ai7j nc(pk) = $!Jfor ~ >0 and thus there cannot be any other local

minimum in this segment. To prove that CN(~~ C C(pi) we observe that if qc S and q @ C(pi) then ll~il[

2J(tic~k -U @ < ll~kll -II?112 which is true because 2~(~.$, ~.~<2xt ~;(ll~hll -Il?ll) < ll~kll l\d12. 
 In order to finish the proof, we only have to show that, for A > xi points AC are not in ker S, and 
this follows easily from Equation (5) and the alternat­ing condition of the points of CN(ZO) and FN(zO) 
around Zo: if y~ and yk have the same sign, we have done and if they have different signs (as in Figure 
3), we have that pl E C (Pk) and either PZ or pj is between pk and pl and the same argument can be made 
with pk and the point between pk and 1 P1. If S is a set of points in convex position (i.e. they are 
the vertices of a convex polygon), because convS c ker S, we have: Corollary 1 IfS 2sin convex position, 
T?s(z) has at most one local minimum inside conv S. Itis worth noticing that Theorem 2 easily gives useful 
properties about distribution of local min­ima in practical examples. For instance, if we assume that 
we have taken a sample of n points which are contained in an annulus of width E cen­tered at the origin 
(we normalize the problem in such a way that the inner radius is one) and de­note by 9 the smallest angle 
between two consec­utive points, a straightforward computation shows that the disk centered at the origin 
with radius (1+ E) sind 6= /l+(l+E)2 2(l+E)COS0 is contained in ker S and thus has at most one local 
minimum. If points are equally distributed and we assume a (huge) 570 error both in the angle and the 
width, for n = 360 we have 6 % 0.33. Then, this result can be used to explain why standard optimization 
methods perform well in practice to approximate the solution. In the next section, we are going to see 
that addi­tional structure of the problem will allow us to de­sign a simple and efficient discrete algorithm 
which can find the exact solution to the problem.  The algorithm Before stating the key result, we need 
some addi­ tional notation and definitions. Given two points Pi and pj, we denote by % the chain between 
Pi .,,, C(pi) : -.., J Figure 4: Illustration of Lemma 2. and pi ordered in positive (counterclockwise) 
di­rection as seen from ker S. We denote by eij the edge of Vf (S) contained in the bisector of segment 
pipj. The end-points of eij will be denoted by cij (the closest one to pi and pj) and by ~ij (the fur­thest 
one). This is well defined except for, at most, one edge of Vf (S), which can be treated separately. 
We observe that Vf (S) n ker S is a forest and denote by T1 ,... , T the trees of this forest. We label 
the points in such a way that triangle cijpipj has positive orientation and denote by ~~ the subtree 
of ~a rooted at cij containing the edge eii (see Figure 4). We observe that this subtree is . made up 
of segments of bisectors Of points Of Sij. there is no local Proofi Let 0 be the unit vector ii= Imll 
We claim that, if C N(cij) n Sij = Ao n Sij = 0 for any ~ >0 and, therefore, there is no local minimum 
on cij + h7n ker S because fur­thest and closest neighbors do not alternate angu­larly. Moreover, the 
lemma follows from the claim by iterating the argument for the set of edges of ~:. To prove the claim, 
assume that cij = o and let Pk = c~(cij). If qE s and q @ C(p;) then it holds 11~~11S !kl [[ and O ~< 
O and thus  ll~d(b d[Iln(llwf$ -2A H)< which is equivalent to say that [[A?7-@~/[ < l[Ati-Ill probing 
that q is not the closest neighbor of Ati. Using the previous lemma the algorithm is straightforward: 
as a first step, we compute Vf (S), VC(S) and preprocess V.(S) for point location. This can be done in 
O(n log n) time. Because the number of intersections between Vf (S) and ker S is linear, the forest Tl, 
. . . , Tm can be computed in time O(n log n) with and standard sweepline al­gorithm. Let us denote by 
na the size of T . We per­form a depth first search in T and locate a vertex with the property that the 
subtrees that it connects have size smaller than cna for c < 1/2 a positive constant and locate the closest 
neighbor of the ver­tex in O (log n) time. We apply the previous lemma and discard all the subtrees except 
the one corre­sponding to the chain containing the closest neigh­bor and discard a linear fraction of 
edges of 7_a. Therefore, Ta is procesed in O(na + log n log na) time obtaining the edge of Ta containing 
the local minimum (if such edge exists). Because the total size of ~1 U ...U 7 is O(n), the algorithm 
runs in O (n log n) time. Then, we have shown: Theorem 3 I_ there is a local minimum of l?s(x) inside 
ker S, it can be computed in O (n log n) time.  Concluding remarks In this paper we have dealt with 
the problem of computing the annulus of minimum width contain­ing a set of points. We have characterized 
the set of local minima of 72s(z) (feasible centers for the annulus) in the d-dimensional case and we 
have shown that, inside the kernel oft he set, there is at most one local minimum which can be computed 
in O(n log n). We remark that the algorithm is more efficient than previous algorithms solving the general 
problem and that it is useful to solve the problem in practice, because in the metrology ap­plication 
the sample points are given in angular order. We also remark that the algorithm is sim­ple and, thus, 
easy to implement. The number of local minima in the whole plane remains as an open problem. It is also 
an interesting open prob­lem to see whether or not a set of points in convex position in the space has 
only one local minimum inside its convex hull. 7 Acknowledgments The authors thank Prof. G. Toussaint
