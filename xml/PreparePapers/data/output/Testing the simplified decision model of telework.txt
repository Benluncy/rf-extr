 sclark@stevens-tech.edu ABSTRACT Virtual organizations that serve customers via the Internet or on- 
line service networks have been growing at an incredible rate. These organizations do not require customers 
to come to the organization's physical location in order to do business. However, many more traditional 
organizations, even those that support virtual clientele, seem resistant to the use of virtual work arrangements. 
For organizations to become truly "virtual" they need to move to alternative work arrangements including 
to telework. This study explores the resistance to remote work in relation to the decision of employees 
to telework. Earlier studies by the authors [4-6] have shown that four factors significantly influence 
the intent of employees to engage in telework. These factors, which together make up the Simplified Decision 
Model (SDM) are Perceived Legitimacy, Perceived Behavioral Control, Work Social Structure and Commute 
Distance. This study attempted to confirm the SDM by surveying 407 subjects who were employed in a wide 
range of organizations in the greater New York City area. Four treatment groups were used to compare 
how each of the four factors affected Behavioral Intent to telework. Strong confirmation for the relationship 
described by SDM was found, but the manipulation of factors in the model proved unsuccessful. Methods 
to better manipulate precursors to Behavioral Intent are discussed. Keywords Telework, virtual organization,

assumption underlying the Virtual Organization and Knowledge Society strategies is that people and organizations 
will adopt a more flexible work environment in which the time and place of the work becomes secondary 
to the accomplishment of a strategic task. The virtual office is a concept that encompasses the idea 
of a time and place independent work environment. For almost 30 years people have been exploring a subset 
of the virtual office using the telework construct. Nilles, who coined the term telework, defines it 
as "ANY form of substitution of information technologies (such as telecommunications and computers) for 
work related travel." [14, p. xix] Telework has been described as using technology to bring the work 
to the worker rather than bringing the worker to the work [see: 16]. While many examples abound of organizations 
that are successfully using technology to bring their products to customers instead of bring their customers 
to their physical location, moving workers out of a central office and into more remote and flexible 
locations has not been adopted to the degree envisioned by proponents. Proponents argue that having more 
of the population work from homes (or nearer to homes) is of interest to governmental agencies as a means 
to reduce air pollution, ameliorate the demand for new highway construction, or handle episodic transportation 
problems that arise due to regional events such as floods, blizzards, and earthquakes [3, 14, 15, 20, 
21]. They argue that telework is of interest to organizations as a means of reducing overhead, attracting 
and keeping highly skilled employees, increasing flexibility, and becoming more competitive. For the 
individual, the personal advantages of teleworking include flexible working conditions, reduced cost 
of commute, reduced stress, and the ability to balance family and work. If having employees work from 
home can benefit the individual, the organization, and society as a whole, why is it not it more prevalent? 
Possible explanations for the disparity between the actual and predicted adoption rates for telework 
are that either it fails to deliver on the net benefits that are theorized, or that there is a weak understanding 
of what is involved in the adoption process and why people actually adopt telework. Looking at the decision 
to adopt telework at the individual level is an important approach because people do not simply wake 
up one day to discover that they are working from home. A series of decisions need to be made to arrange 
for appropriate scheduling, infrastructure, resource allocation, and so forth. Since both managers and 
employees have the power to promote, discourage, veto, or sabotage remote work arrangements, they must 
agree that this is a valid work arrangement in order for it to succeed. The decision to telework can 
be viewed from several perspectives. One view is that telework is an economic investment with costs and 
benefits. In this view telework involves investments in things such as technology and employee training, 
and changes in work style while promising to return certain kinds of economic benefits to the organization, 
society, and the individual [see: 9, 13, 15, 21, 22, 24]. Teleworking can also be viewed as producing 
fundamental change in the way an organization functions. Relationships between managers and employees, 
relationships among co-workers, perhaps even fundamental paradigms of what constitutes an organization 
and how people work together all may be affected by telework. So it may be appropriate for institutional 
theory to be brought to bear on telework in that fundamental changes in the institution could be required 
by the adoption of telework [e.g. 10, 22]. A third perspective is that telework is a technology to be 
adopted. In this view it is the individuals who must change their behavior, use the technology and accept 
changes in organizational relationships. This research stream is typified by Davis [8] with the Technology 
Acceptance Model and later Taylor and Todd [19] with the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior. On this 
basis the decision to adopt telework may fit into the technology acceptance model in that we are talking 
about a new technology and whether or not that technology kvill actually benefit the employee or the 
manager in the pursuit of their job objectives. But if telework is to be viewed as a decision, what influences 
that decision? This paper focuses on the employee as decision-maker. Ruppel and Harrington [17] demonstrated 
that employees appear to be the driving force behind teleworking initiatives. Thus, clearly identifying 
specific factors that could be used to positively motivate employees to telework could increase the frequency 
of teleworking from its current less than expected levels. 2. A SIMPLIFIED DECISION MODEL Clark looked 
at a variety of decision models and then synthesized and tested a decision model that included over 20 
attitudinal factors and their relationship to the intent to telework by employees or to allow telework 
by managers [4, 5]. From this work came a Simplified Decision Model (SDM) for Employees, shown in Figure 
1, through post-hoc analysis of the data gathered. This model was compared to the Technology Acceptance 
Model ]8] as well as an extension of the Theory of Planned Action [1] and found to do a better job accounting 
for variance in Behavioral Intent. Using conservative corrections specified by Cohen &#38; Cohen [7, 
p. 106] for post hoc-analysis these four factors explained 51% of the variance in Behavioral Intent. 
This was true at the p < .01 level based on the tables of Wilkinson [23] which were developed to check 
for the significance of R 2 in a stepwise regression. Brief descriptions of the components of this model 
is in order: 2.1 Behavioral Intent Behavioral Intent is the dependent variable in this model, and is 
based in Fishbein and Ajzen's [11] work on the Theory of Reasoned Action. Clearly the intent to behave 
in a specific   I Perceived Behavioral Control I Perceived Legitimacy ] Behavioral I Commute Intent 
Distance I Work Social Structure  Figure 1 Simplified Decision Model for Employees - manner, and actual 
behavior, may differ. Intentions to lose weight, exercise regularly, stop smoking, or keep one's mouth 
closed at particular points in time may require behaviors that are difficult. Sheppard et al. [18] performed 
a meta-analysis of 87 studies and found "strong overall support for the general predictive utility of 
the Fishbein and Ajzen model" (p. 336). They found this despite considerable use of the model outside 
its originally specified boundaries. They also found strong support for a substantial relationship between 
individuals' intentions and performance. 2.2 Perceived Behavioral Control The Perceived Behavioral Control 
construct is derived from Ajzen's (1985) [1] work on The Theory of Planned Behavior. The construct focuses 
on the perception of the individual as to the availability of the resources, skills, and opportunities 
necessary in order to either telework or supervise a teleworker. It measures a perception of to what 
degree is it possible to actually perform the desired activity. 2.3 Perceived Legitimacy Perceived Legitimacy 
is derived from Westfall's [22] theories on telework from the perspective of Institutional Theory. This 
construct has to do with the social pressure that comes from the perception that others within the firm 
are (or are not) engaging in remote work. Legitimate actions within an organization relate to the official 
acceptability of those actions. To the extent that the decision-maker sees others within accepting telework 
as legitimate, there is additional pressure to telework or at least less of a barrier to engaging in 
such activity. 2.4 Commute Distance Commute Distance is seen as a measure of the degree of pain involved 
in traveling to the office. While not a precise measure of pain, it has been shown by Clark [5] to be 
highly correlated to Behavioral Intent. While this item is not to be tested for causality, it has shown 
good predictive power in the past and continues as part of the model. 103  2.5 Work Social Structure 
The Work Social Structure construct is also derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior. This construct 
focuses on what others in the workplace might think about the issue, in this case telework, and what 
influence they might bring to bear on whether or not the decision-maker should engage in this activity. 
While Work Social Structure is similar in some ways to Perceived Legitimacy, Work Social Structure is 
a measure of whether or not a person perceives others within the workplace believe that employees of 
this organization should themselves telework. In this sense, Perceived Legitimacy is less specific to 
the organization. (For example, an organization may have a prevalent belief structure that fighting fires 
is a legitimate activity but that employees should not be engaging in that activity.) 2.6 Further Support 
for the SDM In a recent study, Clark and Olfman [6] confirmed the strong correlations described in the 
SDM. In that study of 416 subjects they found that Perceived Behavioral Control, Perceived Legitimacy, 
Commute Distance, and Work Social Structure accounted for 63% of the variance in Behavioral Intent at 
the p < .001 level. 3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS While these studies [4, 6] demonstrated the tight relationship 
between Behavioral Intent and the four antecedent factors, they failed to show a causal relationship. 
In order to be prescriptive a model must be causal. That is, if one or more of the precursors in the 
Simplified Decision Model is manipulated it must influence a change in Behavioral Intent., Since the 
original modeling done by Clark [5] was synthesized from the well accepted Theory of Planned Behavior 
[2] causality could be assumed. However, Clark's [5] study only indicated a strong correlation between 
the four factors in the SDM; it was not experimental and thus no causal relationship could be deduced. 
In the second study, Clark and Olfman [6] were unsuccessful in their attempts to manipulate any of the 
precursors and thus did not show the model's causality. Thus, the key research questions are: QI: Can 
the precursors in the Simplified Decision Model be manipulated? Q2: If we can manipulate one or more 
of these factors, will that result in an increase in Behavioral Intent? 3.1 Research Design A quasi-experimental 
study was designed in order to address the research questions. The experiment is a posttest only design 
with four treatment groups. The goal was to determine if presenting particular information on (manipulating) 
a specific factor could increase the correlation of that factor on Behavioral Intent. For this study 
an additional "control" precursor, Perceived Usefulness, was added to the model as shown in Figure 2. 
In the original study [5] Perceived Usefulness did not show significant correlation to Behavioral Intent 
and when added to the SDM model did not significantly alter the results. This revised model actually 
was used in the Clark and Olfman Study [6] and again Perceived Usefulness did not contribute to the variance 
in Behavioral Intent. It is included in this study again in order to determine whether manipulating a 
factor that did not contribute to Behavioral Intent will change that dynamic. Perceived Behavioral Control 
 Perceived Legitimacy Commute Behavioral 1 Intent Distance I Work Social Structure I Perceived Usefulness 
 Figure 2 -Test Model There were two "real" treatment groups and two "control" treatment groups. We felt 
that Perceived Behavioral Control and Commute Distance would be factors that were effectively resistant 
to manipulation. At the same time, we felt we might be able to manipulate Work Social Structure and Perceived 
Legitimacy, two factors that showed a strong correlation to Behavioral Intent. We also felt that we might 
be able to manipulate Perceived Usefulness even though it had shown no correlation to Behavioral Intent. 
Thus four groups were established. In the first two groups we attempted to manipulate the perception 
of Work Social Structure and Perceived Legitimacy, which might in turn increase Behavioral Intent. The 
other two groups were used as controls. The first manipulated Perceived Usefulness to look at the manipulation 
of a factor that has not been shown to contribute to Behavioral Intent. The second was the Control group 
which, instead of manipulating a specific factor, raised generic interest in telework by emphasizing 
that it is a good thing for society and the environment.  3.2 Questionnaires Four questionnaires were 
developed, corresponding to the four treatment groups. The first page consisted of an identical generic 
introduction and request for help in the form of a short letter from the authors. Niles' [14] definition 
of teleworking as "moving the work to the workers instead of moving the workers to work; periodic work 
out of the central office, one or more days per week either at home or in a telework center" (p. xix) 
was given at the beginning of the survey to be used by respondents when considering the answer to questions. 
The second page contained 11 background questions, followed by one of four fabricated press releases. 
Three of the press releases were designed to manipulate a single construct (Work Social Structure, Perceived 
Legitimacy, or Perceived Usefulness). Each of these three was four paragraphs and approximately 230 words 
long. The text of the "Perceived 104 Usefulness" press release appears in Appendix A. The fourth (the 
control) was two paragraphs totaling 175 words that generally advocated teleworking without targeting 
a particular construct. In each of the four press releases, the first and last sentences were made to 
look very similar. A good deal of effort and consultation went into making these press releases believable 
and something that might also change people's opinions about whichever construct they addressed. Several 
iterations were written and reviewed by a marketing expert. The last two pages of the questionnaires 
were identical, consisting of 28 questions which were on a 7 point Likert scale from "Strongly Disagree" 
to "Strongly Agree", a single question on Commute Distance, and a single question asking the average 
number of days per month the respondent intended to telework ~. For the purpose of this study, the respondent's 
actual reported one way Commute Distance was converted to a 7-point scale as follows: 1 less than 10 
miles 2 I0 to 19.9 miles 3 20 to 29.9 miles 4 30 to 39.9 miles 5 40 to 59.9 miles 6 60 to 79.9 miles 
7 80 or more miles Because subjects were told in the introduction that we wanted opinions about the press 
release (and the title was "Press Release Survey" on the front page), the first nine of these 29 questions 
asked for opinions about the press release itself. This 9-question scale was subdivided into two additional 
scales broadly indicating the value of the press release and whether it had sufficient details. The Perceived 
Legitimacy scale consisted of three questions that focused more on whether the subjects thought others 
in the workplace thought that teleworking was legitimate. The three- question scale for Work Social Structure 
focused on general questions about who should telework. The scales for Perceived Usefulness, Perceived 
Behavioral Control, Commute Distance, and Behavioral Intent consisted of 9, 3, 1, and 2 questions, respectively. 
A few changes were made in the questionnaire as compared to the one used in the Clark and Olfman study 
[6]. An additional question was added regarding Perceived Value of the press release. Perceived Legitimacy 
was previously a two-question scale that was focused on the frequency the subject actually saw others 
telework. In the current version, 'T' was changed to read "others in the organization." Work Social Structure 
questions previously were more general. The other four scales remained the same as in prior studies. 
(See Appendix B for details of the changes in the Perceived Legitimacy and Work Social Structure Scales.) 
The surveys were collated into one large stack which had survey 1 followed by survey 2, survey 3, survey 
4, and then survey 1 again. The surveys looked identical, and the stack thus appeared to be one large 
set of a single questionnaire. n For all respondents, regardless of whether they currently telework, 
this scale focused on intention to telework during the coming year 3.3 Sample Population This was a field 
study using an accidental (non-probability) sampling [12] survey of 407 employees working for a variety 
of companies in the vicinity of New York City. Sixty graduate students (all employed adults) were given 
the opportunity to earn extra credit by handing out and collecting surveys (to a maximum of 10 surveys 
per student) from others within their organizations. The students themselves filled out one questionnaire 
and then were asked to distribute copies to colleagues. They were not informed that there were different 
versions of the survey. They were asked not to duplicate the surveys at work but simply to take the number 
of surveys they wanted from the stack. No attempt was made to target a particular level of an organization 
or population within an organization. These students were all taking an introductory course in the Management 
of Information Systems, so their occupations and interests may not be representative of a larger population. 
 4. RESULTS A total of 407 responses were received. As shown in Table 1, there were approximately equal 
numbers of subjects in each treatment category. From Table 2, we can determine that 36.4% of respondents 
reported being female, 59.7% reported being male, while 7.5% chose not to report gender. Press Release

categories. Table 4 shows that 49.4% of respondents reported a one-way commute distance of less than 
20 miles. The average reported one-way commute distance was 22.6 miles with a standard deviation of 21.4 
miles. Table 5 shows that 17.0% of respondents reported that they telework at least 1 day per week while 
Table 6 shows 7.1% of respondents actually supervise teleworkers. Both of these are very similar to the 
percentages found in Clark and Olfman [6]. As shown in table 7, the six question scale designated Press 
Release I (Value) had a Cronbach's alpha of .79 while the three question scale designated Press Release 
2 (Details) had an alpha of only .39. The overall 9-question Press Release scale had an alpha of.68 which 
is better than the similar 8 question scale in the Clark and Olfman [6] study where the value was .58.

Intent was .79, which is slightly lower than the .86 in the Clark and Olfman [6] study. Perceived Behavioral 
Control was .61, also down from the .67 for the same scale in the earlier study. The third scale, which 
was unchanged between the two studies was Perceived Usefulness had an alpha of .90 that was slightly 
less than the .94 of the prior study. The first of the two modified scales, Perceived Legitimacy, had 
a Cronbach's alpha of .68, which is lower than the .92 of the earlier study, but according to Cohen and 
Cohen [7] is still acceptable for exploratory research. The other modified scale, Work Social Structure, 
also dropped from an earlier Cronbach's alpha of .92 to a respectable .72. Table 8 shows the means of

the groups. The column on the far right is the probability that these mean scores (and more accurately 
the pattern of scores in each group from which the group mean is derived) could happen by chance. In 
the case of Behavioral Intent, there is a 62% chance that the variation in scores between groups happened 
by chance. Thus we see that it is highly unlikely that there is any real difference between the groups 
in terms of Behavioral Intent, Perceived Behavioral Control, Perceived Legitimacy, Commute Distance, 
Press Release attitudes (overall), and Press Release 1 (Value) attitudes. The reported differences for 
all of these scales can be accounted for by chance. Work Social Structure and Perceived Usefulness scales 
do show a variation which is significant at the p < .10 level, however looking at the data it appears 
as if this is because the Perceived Usefulness treatment group scored noticeably lower than the other 
three groups on both of these measures. Behavioral Intent was regressed on the five precursors for the 
entire population and by group. The results are shown in Table 9. While the five precursors accounted

Another difference is that neither Perceived Legitimacy nor Commute Distance had any uniqueness to contribute 
to the variance. Work Social Structure was significant at the p < .01 level for two of the treatment 
groups, but not for two others and, more importantly, not for the entire subject population. This is 
different than previous studies in which all three contributed to Behavioral Intent. Finally, Perceived 
Usefulness actually did contribute significantly to Behavioral Intent for both the Control Group and 
the Perceived Legitimacy Group although it had not been shown to do so in earlier studies. Work Social 
Structure's contribution to the variance in Behavioral Intent is significant at the p < .01 level for 
the Perceived Usefulness and Work Social Structure treatment groups, and the Behavioral Intent has a 
higher R 2 in both those groups. 5. DISCUSSION As shown in Figure 3 and Table 9, Perceived Behavioral 
Control contributes strongly to the variance of Behavioral Intent at the p < .001 level. Also consistent 
with the SDM, in two of the treatment groups, Perceived Usefulness and Work Social Structure, the Work 
Social Structure component contributes to the variance of Behavioral Intent at the p < .01 level. After 
that, the results begin to differ considerably. Measure Behavioral Intent (adjusted R 2) Perceived Behavioral

0.17 100 Perceived Legitimacy showed no contribution to Behavioral Intent in any of the groups or in 
the population as a whole. In Clark and Olfman [6] it contributed at the p < .01 level for two of the 
treatment groups, not significantly for two groups, and at the p < .001 level for the population as a 
whole. One explanation for the change is that the Perceived Legitimacy scale was changed between this 
study and the previous ones. The previous Perceived Legitimacy scale asked questions about the visibility 
of telework and teleworkers within the organization while this new version of the scale asked subjects 
whether or not people within their organization perceived telework as a legitimate activity (see Appendix 
B for more details). Commute Distance also showed no contribution to the variance in Behavioral Intent. 
In Clark and Olfman [6] it contributed at the p < .05 level for two of the treatment groups, not significantly 
for one group, and at the p < .001 level for the control group and the population as a whole. In the 
previous study, subjects worked in Southern California, while in this study the population worked in 
the area in and around New York City. The transportation systems are notably different in these two regions. 
While there is a significant lack of the infrastructure for public transport in the metropolitan Los 
Angeles area, the commuter rail services in the greater New York area are well developed, One of the

Figure 3 -R 2 and Path Coefficients (13) for all Subjects Angeles Freeway System to riding the New Jersey 
commuter rail system. It may well be that the real issue in commuting - and thus its contribution to 
the intent to telework -is the pain associated with the commute and not the distance itself. Perhaps 
in the earlier study Commute Distance was a reasonable surrogate for "Commute Pain" while in this study, 
because of the ease of mass transit, it is not a reasonable surrogate. The Work Social Structure construct 
showed mixed results in this study. It was a significant contributor (at the p < .01 level) to the variance 
in two of the groups, but not significant in the other two or in the population as a whole. In the Clark 
and Olfman [6] study it contributed at the p < .001 level for all of the treatment groups and the population 
as a whole. Work Social Structure was the other scale that was modified. In this study the questions 
were less specific to the individual subject. It may be that the critical aspect of Work Social Structure 
with regard to Behavioral Intent has to do with the details specific to the individual, not the organization 
as a whole. It may be, for example, that people in an organization generally think most employees should 
telework, but that "Bob" as an individual should not. Or they could think that telework is a bad idea 
in general but that is not the case for "Sue". It seems to make sense that an individual might pay more 
attention to the attitudes specific to him or her than to less specific/more general attitudes. It is 
interesting to note that the R 2 was quite a bit higher in the two groups for which Work Social Structure 
contributed significantly to Behavioral Intent (that is in the Perceived Usefulness and Work Social Structure 
groups). In this study the contribution of Perceived Usefulness to Behavioral Intent was significant 
at the p < .001 level for all subjects. This was also true for the Control group. For two other groups, 
Work Social Structure and Perceived Legitimacy it was significant at the p < .05 level. This finding 
is far different than in prior studies in which Perceived Usefulness showed no correlation to Behavioral 
Intent. Unexpectedly, it is only the group in which we tried to increase Perceived Usefulness in which 
Perceived Usefulness does not contribute significantly to Behavioral Intent. In the Control Group the 
mean for Perceived Usefulness is high while the Behavioral Intent is the lowest. In fact, the Control 
Group scores on all the precursor measures are at or near the highest of the four groups but they have 
the lowest score with regard to Behavioral Intent. This study failed to demonstrate manipulation of any 
of the precursors in the SDM. It also failed to manipulate Behavioral Intent. It may have failed in these 
areas because the mechanism employed, that is the press release, is simply inadequate to the task. It 
may be that Work Social Structure, Perceived Legitimacy, and Perceived Behavioral Control are very specific 
to the individual's workplace and altering people's perceptions means changing those perceptions within 
the context of their work environment rather than in a more general approach (e.g., telework can benefit 
the employee). This would make sense in that the best match between atttitudes and behavioral intent 
comes from questions worded to be very specific about the potential behaviors (Ajzen &#38; Fishbein, 
1975). It can not be ruled out that a better-written, longer, or more persuasive article may have had 
some manipulative effect. In any case it is clear that these attitudes are not easily changed. More importantly, 
this study shed some light on some of the constructs of the model. Commute Distance should perhaps be 
changed to "Commute Pain" or "Commute Aversion". It would make sense that it is really the degree to 
which the commute is disagreeable that affects an individual's desire to telework, and not simply the 
distance traveled. It also seems reasonable that for Work Social Structure the perceptions of how others 
in the organization view the affected individual in particular might be a stronger influence than how 
they view the more general employee population. Thus Work Social Structure is more likely the individual's 
view of the immediate situation, not that of the company as a whole -at least as it affects Behavioral 
Intent toward telework. With regard to Perceived Legitimacy, the earlier studies measured the visibility 
of telework within an organization as a surrogate for legitimacy. The argument was that if others in 
the organization were doing it then it was a legitimate activity within that organization. This certainly 
had a better correlation with Behavioral Intent than the current study's scale that simply asks about 
legitimacy. In the older studies both Perceived Legitimacy and Perceived Behavioral Control were significant, 
but Perceived Behavioral Control did not have nearly as high a Beta as in the current study. It may be 
that the old scale had partial overlap with Perceived Behavioral Control. If others in the organization 
are seen teleworking, then it may be more within another individual's control to make that true for himself 
or herself. Perhaps another name for the measure such as "Program Visibility" is appropriate. Or it may 
be that there is a relationship here to Work Social Structure and organizational norms. Individuals may 
prefer to do what is actually seen as a normal behavior in the organization rather than what is simply 
verbalized as acceptable or legitimate. 6. CONCLUSION This quasi-experimental study further confirmed 
the SDM, but showed that factors may be work-context sensitive. Consideration should be made with regard 
to modifications of three scales. Commute Distance should be changed to reflect the pain or aversion 
of subjects to the daily commute. Perhaps "Commute Avoidance" might be the new factor that might include, 
actual distance, time, and level of distaste questions. Perceived Legitimacy should remain in the newer 
form and directly explore the subjects' perceptions about others beliefs. A new scale "Telework Visibility" 
could be added, which makes use of the questions from the old Perceived Legitimacy scale. This factor 
(which in previous studies was called legitimacy) has shown a strong correlation to Behavioral Intent. 
It may be that seeing others adopt this work style successfully is a strong motivator. If true, it certainly 
has implications for how Telework programs are implemented in organizations. The Work Social Structure 
scale should return to the more personal questions in which the subject reflects on whether or not others 
within the organization believe that he or she personally should telework. It would appear to make sense 
that employees are more sensitive to opinions directed at them as compared to more general opinions. 
Future Research should consider these scale modifications and attempt manipulation of specific factors 
within specific organizations after assessing the work context of each. The goal would be to determine 
if the SDM can help an organization decide what factors will lead it to encourage employees and their 
managers to use telework. 7. REFERENCES I. Ajzen, I. From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned

of scientists from Indiana University, UCLA, and the University of Oslo, 27 percent of teleworkers felt 
they had greater control of their work. The findings were presented by Dr. S. Dimock at the Virtual Environments 
Conference in Baltimore last month. The study also found that managers, who were often initially dubious, 
judged their teleworkers more effective and more productive than their counterparts by a margin of almost 
three to one. Seventeen percent of teleworkers reported that their jobs were more interesting and 8% 
found their jobs were easier. "Prior to this work many have seen telework as just appropriate for a select 
few 'Knowledge Workers' - often working in the IS department of larger organizations," Dimock reported. 
"Now we are finding that it can be used effectively by loggers, florists, tour guides, manufacturers 
and designers, as well as by financial analysts and others in the services sector. Surveying over 400 
organizations from diverse industries we learned that 62% of them have discovered the usefulness and 
value of telework It will be an important and perhaps essential tool in making corporations more competitive 
well into the 21 st century." Once the stuffof dreams and science fiction, it looks as though telework 
is finally taking off. It has been found extremely useful to society, individuals and to a wide variety 
of companies as well. Appendix B -Modification of Scales Perceived Legitimacy The Perceived Legitimacy 
scale was changed because of concern that the earlier scale made an assumption that the visibility of 
telework implied it was perceived as legitimate. Instead, we decided to directly ask subjects their perceptions 
of the belief structures of others in their workplace. Old Perceived Legitimacy Scale: i. I have a number 
of co-workers who telecommute. 2. A number of people in my department telework.  Revised Perceived Legitimacy 
Scale: 1. My colleagues and coworkers think/would think that telecommuting is a legitimate way of working. 
 2. My boss/supervisor/manager thinks/would think that telecommuting is a legitimate way of working. 
 3. My subordinates think/would think that telecommuting is a legitimate way of working.  Work Social 
Structure The Work Social Structure scale was changed because of concern that the earlier scale focused 
too much on the subject's opinion of what he or she in particular should do. Instead, we decided to ask 
subjects about more general pressure to telework. Old Work Social Structure Scale: 1. My colleagues 
and coworkers would think that I should telecommute. 2. My boss/supervisor/manager would think that 
I should telecommute. 3. My subordinates would think that I should telecommute.   Revised Work Social 
Structure Scale: 1. My colleagues and coworkers think/would think that more people in this organization 
should telecommute. 2. My boss/supervisor/manager thinks/would think that more people in this organization 
should telecommute. 3. My subordinates think/would think that more people in this organization should 
telecommute.  110
