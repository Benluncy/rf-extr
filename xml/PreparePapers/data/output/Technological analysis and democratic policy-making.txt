 TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND DEMOCRATIC POLICY-MANING By: Marshall H. Whithed Political Science Department 
 Temple University Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122 Abstract The paper centers upon the implications 
of technical analytical methodologies, espe- cially those which are computer-based, for public policy-making. 
A generalized analysis of the lack of suitable educational and experiental background of most public 
policy- makers is presented, and it is suggested that this lack makes it difficult for such offi- cials 
to adequately evaluate technical analyses. Means to ameliorate this problem are discussed, and a model 
of policy-maker/computer methodology interface is presented. The example used is based on a computer 
simulation model and related methodologies which are presently developed for HUD to study New Town fiscal 
and economic viability. TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND DEMOCRATIC POLICY-MAKING The increasing necessity 
to utilize modern technology in the service of the governmen- tal process has raised the necessity of 
dealing with the question of the interrelationship between the technological experts and decision-making 
in a democratic context, and also the question of the educational preparation of both these two groups 
to deal with these problems. The question issues in several forn~s. One of these forms was illustrated, 
several years ago, by the debate over ABM policy. A major difficulty for policy-makers in the political 
process was the fact that the technological experts, the scientists, could not themselves agree upon 
the effectiveness of the proposed system. In fact, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) was moved to assemble 
a team of scientists to prepare a volume of pro and con papers on the subject; this collection was subsequently 
found to be so useful that a publisher produced the volume for public consumption. Until that time, however, 
copies of the Kennedy volume, in typescript form, were very sought-after items. Something like the potential 
workability of the ABM is, of course, a very detailed and technical question, and it becomes obviously 
difficult for public policy-makers, not knowledgeable in the technological detail required to comprehend 
and evaluate the pro and con arguments, to go on to make substantive public policy decisions. This example 
is one wherein policy-makers must deal with conflicting scientific advice regarding the merits of a proposed 
technology, with the policy-makers expected to go on and determine whether to adopt the system or not. 
This situation is a common one, and poses difficulty, obviously. But, some would suggest, things become 
even much more sticky when the technological experts directly propose public policy directions, based 
on their expertise (or professed such). This is particularly the case as the social scientists become 
more active in (i) developing a technology --or at least the appearance of same (preferably using, somehow, 
computers and producing computer printout); and (2) suggest- ing that their policy recommendations are 
based on their technological expertise --which methodology or expertise is not understood by the policy 
decision-maker any more than he understands missile technology. What is being suggested, in this instance, 
is that those situations wherein the "ex- pert" becomes much more direct in suggesting policy determinations 
to the elected decision- makers are becoming more frequent. The increasing activity of governmental 
processes in social areas --such as environ- ment, cities, education, etc. --in effect guarantees that 
the social scientists and others will be turned to more and more for their professional advice. A corrolary 
to this is the likelihood that more and more of these situations will be such that the expert will be 
providing recommendations directly for public policy formulation, rather than, as in an earlier day, 
the engineering technician was asked for professional advice on the technical feasibility of a proposal. 
 Illustrations of this are to be found in many of our domestic social-engineering pro- grams designed 
for our poverty and/or inner-city problems during the 1960's. A much more glaring example is to be found 
in American foreign policy, particularly with reference to Southeast Asia. Although it perhaps is not 
generally known amongst the population at large, the role of selected social scientists, and particularly 
those of so-called "coun- ter-insurgency school" of thought, was prominent in the decision-making processes 
which 75 involved this country so deeply in that part of the world. With the increasing demands for 
governmental action to deal with the crisis of many social problems, including those of the environment, 
technologically-oriented profession- als are going to be increasingly called upon to provide, based upon 
their expertise, in- puts to the political decision-making process. That this is so should suggest the 
neces- sity of undertaking a searching examination of the role and place of technological inputs to public 
policy-making in a democracy. For the problem is, basically, that if the tech- nicians control the decisions 
(even if by default of the supposed decision-makers --or even if the technicians, given their supposed 
expertise, are allowed in effect to set the agenda for discussable alternatives to be considered by elected 
public officials), these major public decisions are being made by persons whom the public does not know 
and has no control over through the ballot box. P_olitics, Seniority, and Lack of Computer Education 
 We might note in this context that the evaluation of new technologies falls particu- larly heavily upon 
the political decision-making system, and most particularly the legis- latures. For in political decision-making 
contexts, it is very much the case that age seniority is a corrolary of important political position. 
Individuals tend to advance in political power in the executive branch of government somewhat more slowly 
than in the business, or even the academic worlds. In the legislative branch, the seniority system comes 
full flower, in that the most important committee positions, where most of the major decisions are really 
made, are occupied by aged men. In short, the political decision- making structure in most countries 
is occupied by aging men. It might be remembered that in 1960 John F. K~nnedy, a very abnormally young 
president in terms of historical precedent, beeame the first president (and indeed, probably the first 
head of state of a major country in the world) to be born in this century. Most of our major political 
decision-makers have, in short, been born and also under- gone their formative eduoation (through the 
college level and thereafter) before the ad- vent of such major political system-affecting events as 
 --Space travel --The ICBM --Television (which only became wide-spread in the '50's) --The computer 
(the first, cumbersome and electro-magnetic, was put together in WWlI) --Operations Research (from 
Britain, in WWII) --The Bomb --and the possibility of instant obliteration of all life --The possibility 
of collapse of the coo-system --The possible decline of revolutionary communism --The jetplane --and 
indeed, long distance air travel at all --The photocopy machine (various variants) --Etc, etc, etc. 
 --Even --the "discovery" of poverty in the U.S. In short, many of the major issues in this country 
today --and many other countries, for that matter --are simply beyond the educational preparation patterns 
of many of the aged people making the political decisions today --both in the U.S. and in other coun- 
tries as well. It may also be interesting to note that the social sciences exhibit, in terms of personnel, 
a somewhat similar time lag. The university-level "methodological course," particularly one that deals 
with the use of computers, is a relatively recent phenomenon in political science education --dating 
from the last decade for the most part. And a detailed discussion of the implications of modern computer 
capabilities for politieal/so- cial analysis in terms of substantive possibilities is still almost ignored 
in political science curricula --up to and including that of the doctoral level. So, all of this and 
more raises, pointedly, the question of an appropriate role for technological and/or analytical expertise 
in terms of political democratic theory, and appropriate computer education for this purpose. It seems 
that there may be an increasing interest amongst political decision-makers for technological inputs to 
political decision- making which are framed in a manner so as to be of use to them instead of being framed 
in a manner primarily oriented to the needs of bureaucratic systems. There are also indica- tions that 
there are an increasing number of political decision-makers who feel the need for a more adequate education 
in computer analysis techniques, at least to the point where they may more adequately evaluate implications 
for public policy. 76 An Illustrative Model A model of a system to deal in part with this problem 
may be taken from a project the writer presently is involved with for the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. The project was a feasibility study of adopting a previously-developed urban simulation 
analysis system to a procedure for evaluating the fiscal and financial viability of New Town development 
plans or proposals. I In this work an adaption of the previous urban analysis system to an analysis 
of a specific New Town was made, and the resultant prototype New Towns Simulator is called NUCOMS. This 
prototype NUCOMS system has been utilized to explore the development of one New Town, and it also constitutes 
the basis for a more extended analysis system being de- veloped for generalized New Towns proposal evaluation. 
 Historical Development of the NUCOMS Project The components of the Basic NUCOMS System have evolved 
over a period of about ten years. Part of the historical antecedents of the work can be traced back to 
the pioneer- ing work of Professor Ira Lowry,2 and its modification by Crecine as represented in "TOMM," 
the Time Oriented Metropolitan Model. 3 The TOMM model has been modified for use as a component in the 
New Community Simulator (NUCOMS) by substituting generalized "at- tractiveness coefficients" for the 
geographic distance parameters used in the original Lowry model and TOMM systems. 4 Other components 
of the New Communities Simulator find their intellectual antecedents in the SCANCAP and SCANPED Systems, 
developed in 1966 and 1968 respectively. These sys- tems augmented TOMM by producing detailed projections 
of neighborhood characteristics such as health, education, crime, ethnic composition, and others. These 
various components, and other refinements, were brought together in the Provin- cial Municipal Simulation 
System (PROMUS) under development by D.F. Blumberg and other staff members of Decision Sciences Corporation. 
It incorporates the features described above, and in addition, contains a complete urban financial model 
for use in planning and budgeting. It is being developed for the city of Toronto, Canada. The PROMUS 
system (Figure i) consists of two major sub-systems: The Community Model Subsystem (CMS) -- which describes 
an existing or new community in terms of size, location, internal diversity, etc. The Financial Policy 
Planning Subsystem (FPPS) -- which provides the basis for computing the costs, cash flow, and return 
on invest- ment of given development and operation programs. Within this system is a specific model used 
for the financial evaluation of new community or area development pro- grams. These two models are connected 
through a policy implementation program. In essence, the community development plan is first tested 
in terms of its initial financial viability (i.e., cash flow, basic return on invested capital, etc.). 
The community structure is then implemented through the community model (through the Policy Implementation 
Program), and the actual community growth and change is then projected, considering both the inter- 
 nal demographic-economic structure and the exogenous factors which may affect the commun- ity. This 
system, in conjunction with other elements of the Financial Planning Model will IThis work was carried 
out in 1971 by Decision Science Corporation, in fulfillment of con- tract #H-1496 for the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. 2Lowry, I.S., A Model of Metropolis, RAND Corporation, RM-4035,RC,

Model, see "The Lowry Model Heritage," by W. Goldner in American Institute of Planners Journal, March 
1971. The revisions in the original Lowry Model made by Decision Sciences Corp. are de- tailed in New

Penna., 1971. 77 then evaluate and project the effects of the internal development plan of the community 
on housing mix, community services and government, social factors (which can be quantitative- ly measured), 
etc. Thus, the PROMUS system provides the basic capability to evaluate the viability of the community 
plan, as well as the economic, demographic, social and indus- trial impact which will result from this 
plan. The PROMUS system also incorporates a graphic output subsystem called SYMAP, original- ly developed 
by the Harvard Computation Laboratory as a general graphics output system. This system produces maps 
showing urban growth characteristics on the regional level, the study area level, and at the community 
level. Capabilities permit a wide variety of physi- cal, economic, and social outputs to be displayed. 
A representative SYMAP output for the City of Toronto is shown in Figure 2. Basic New Community Simulator 
(NUCOMS) Structure The collection of programs described above formed the nucleus for the Basic NUCOMS 
evaluator system. The Basic NUCOMS System is comprised of three separate, but inter- locking submodels 
as shown in Figure 3. The first is the Small Area Submodel which pre- dicts the change in population 
and employment by small area. Optionally, the Small Area Submodel may drive the Neighborhood Submodel 
which can produce tabular output, as well as graphic ouput through SYMAP. In this case, the Neighborhood 
Submodel combines the poli- eies of local governments and institutions, the changes in employment and 
population, and past socio-economic indicators to predict future soeio-economie patterns. The basic spa- 
tial organization predicted by the Small Area Submodel from regional and study area data drives the Financial 
Model System (FMS). The FMS produces tabular output establishing the financial viability of the New Community 
proposal. NUCOMS and Public Policy-Makers One of the several fundamental goals of this research program 
is to produce a manage- ment information system which can assist HUD in the evaluation of New Community 
proposals. The system being proposed must meet higher demands than most management information sys- tems 
because of the special requirement placed upon it: The necessity for policy-makers to interact with 
the system and to explore the ef- fects of alternative policies. The need for a system that is easy 
and simple for decision-makers to utilize. A system that is complicated to use, no matter how useful 
its output, will tend to be under-utilized by decision-makers. It follows, given the busy schedules 
of decision-makers, that it is desirable to auto- mate the evaluation system as much as possible, consistent 
with the policy content of the data, so that as much of the review process as possible may be accomplished 
by lower level administrators. Conversely, however, control over policy content must be allocated to 
th~ higher level policy-makers. The distinction here is between bureaucratic implementation of policy 
and higher level formulation of policy. The problem of creating a management information system for 
new communities is fur- ther complicated by the necessity to incorporate qualitative and/or subjective 
factors in- to the review process. Such factors, while difficult to incorporate into an analytical and 
systematic process, nevertheless may play a major role in the success or failure of the proposed new 
community. The research undertaken in this study suggested the potential of making explicit these subjective 
evaluation data which, although present in existing decision analysis modes, are often unrecognized as 
playing a role in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the output of the New Communities evaluation 
system must clearly be matched to HUD's modus operandi for decisions of the magnitude of New Town loan 
guarantees. A simple "yes or no" answer would be inappropriate, but so would a highly detailed techni- 
cal report which is extremely difficult for public officials to comprehend. The ideal in- termediate 
solution is a hierarchial information structure in which suitable outputs are provided to each level 
within HUD in a sequential fashion. Based upon these considerations the proposed structure of the evaluation 
system in which the New Towns evaluation programs are to be embedded should have the following char- 
acteristics: A step-wise graduation of review modes starting with checklist criteria against which the 
developer's proposal can be verified by low level administrative 78 assistance; If the developer's 
proposal passes this easy-tQ[administer checklist, the proposed development data are passed through a 
computerJ~imulation model (NUCOMS) to evalu- ate the financial and eeonomic feasibility of the new community 
proposal. The NUCOMS system produces extensive quantitative output in terms of tables and maps for various 
future periods in the New Community project. Given the high speed of modern computers, alternative planning 
and program mixes for the new community can be explored, and extrapolations of projected outcomes for 
ten or twenty or more years into the future rapidly obtained. Since this procedure is in large measure 
mechanistic, most of these analyses can be accomplished by relatively low-level bureaucrats. If the 
developer's proposal has passed these thresholds or cut-off criteria, it is necessary to move on to incorporate 
policy and qualitative factors into the evaluation procedure. The proposed system incorporates policy-makers 
at this stage of the process, after the preliminary evaluation steps listed above which can be handled 
by lower level eople have been executed. This is the point at which the knowledge and expertise of the 
igher level people should be brought to bear upon the qualitative aspects of the proposed new community 
plan. Figure 4 shows the general scheme of this parallel qualitative and quantitative evalu- ation process. 
The individual steps are described below. The step numbers are also in- dicated on Figure 4. Step i: 
The developer prepares an initial analysis and decides to go ahead with develop- ment of a proposal. 
He will check informally with HUD periodically and develop a formal proposal for submission to HUD. The 
data format requirements of HUD for these proposals should be such as to expedite the evaluation steps 
below. Step 2: After the proposal is received at HUD, those aspects of the proposal which are easiest 
and most mechanical to check are examined first. Consequently, the pro- posals can be screened in the 
early stages by lower-level personnel at HUD, and some proposals may be screened out at this stage without 
requiring effort by higher-level personnel of use of a simulation analysis. Step two provides a checklist 
of some basic quantitative requirements; the de- veloper's proposal can be quickly examined to see if 
a fit is obtained. If not, the proposal is returned to the developer. If the proposal meets the checklist 
criteria, lt is passed on to step three. Step 3: Data from the developer's proposal is prepared for 
computer input (HUD's applica- tion format requirements Mould be established with these needs in mind), 
and in- put into the NUCOMS System. NUCOMS computer runs on some developer proposals may quite obviously 
indicate lack of financial and/or economic viability, and thus the proposal would be returned to the 
developer as unacceptable. Step 4: The output of the NUCOMS evaluation stages would then be submitted 
to a minimum quantitative acceptability test. This would consist of a codification of accept- able outputs 
from the Advanced NUCOMS model. It should also be noted that up to this point the evaluation process 
has been quite mechanical and procedural and has required little or no attention from busy upper-level 
personnel. Step 5: Step five would involve evaluation and weighting procedure. For example, some proposals 
may rank lower on some factors but quite high on others. Additionally, HUD,poliey guidelines, which may 
change over time, may suggest that certain per- formance criteria be given special weight. The establishment 
of these weighting factors is obviously a matter of public po- licy. Stage five, therefore, envisions 
a team of high-level policy-makers who establish these weightings. This need not be done for every developer 
proposal but only when it is desired to change the policies reflected in weightings. Step 6: Step six 
in the review process concerns the qualitative factors pertaining to the acceptability or non-acceptability 
of the new community proposal. Some of these qualitative factors can be dealt with by evaluating the. 
proposal against a check- list. This step, too, is one that can be dealt with on a routine basis by sub- 
 ordinate personnel. Step 7: If the developer's proposal has passed all of these checkpoints successfully, 
it now goes to an evaluation team. Note that this is the first step in the process that the valuable 
time of these persons is called upon. This final step is one in which subjective factors are weighed. 
The results of the previous steps are available as inputs into this process, along with the system data 
base which makes relative evaluation of competing proposals possible. In addition, the out- put of the 
formal risk analysis procedures, which establish the degree of uncer- tainty in the New Community projections, 
can be considered by the evaluation team. The focus of this part of the New Communities Evaluation system 
has been to develop an interface between the computer simulation analysis system (NUCOMS) and the non-technologi- 
cally oriented public policy-maker who must use the results from the computer simulation analysis as 
an input to his decision-making. The success or failure of this particular model, designed in a Phase 
One contract, will have to await implementation in a Phase Two project. Irregardless of the success or 
otherwise of this particular model~ however, the problem of providing a proper educational backing to 
both the computer specialists and others who will design the computer-based analysis systems, and the 
public policy-makers who will have to utilize the outputs of those analyses in their decision-making 
will in- creasingly be one of critical importance. Potential Application of Interactive Time Share Procedures 
 One approach to the problem of the public decision-maker/computer analysis system in- terface now being 
considered for possible implementation in future development of a more advanced New Communities Analysis 
system is the utilization of interactive time share com- puter programming in a conversational mode. 
The use of such techniques could be applied in the utilization of other policy analysis schemes as well, 
thus providing the policy- maker with a means of interacting directly with the computer analysis models. 
 As illustrated by several instructional urban simulation models we are using in classes at Temple University, 
a remote computer terminal is utilized to type out instruc- tions and questions in regular English language 
format, and the user types in the request- ed decision information in simple English language or numerical 
format. Figure 5 illus- trates such an interactive conversational mode environment. Computer programming 
in this instance is in FORTRAN, and is run on a time share CDC 6400 computer at Temple University. These 
programs have also been run by us on UNIVAC 1108 and General Electric Mark Two (commercial) time share 
machines, as well as the CDC commercial (Kronos) time share ser- vice. The application of such procedures 
to public policy analysis computer models, whether as we hope to do with the NUCOMS project or in other 
similar applications, has a number of significant implications for the policy-maker/technology interface 
problem: --Policy-makers can interact with the analysis system directly. --Policy-makers gain confidence 
and skill in working with computer analysis modes, and this sense of confidence may subsequently carry 
over into the use of computer tech- niques for other applications. --Policy-makers are enabled to utilize 
the computer analysis system directly them- selves without having to rely upon intermediaries. This may 
be important in terms of lessening policy-makers' reliance on anonymous technicians whom the public cannot 
hold accountable to them at the ballot box (a critical aspect of political account- ability in a democracy 
is that the voters may hold decision-makers to account at periodic elections, but if the policy decision-makers' 
decision alternatives are in reality structured by technical personnel, this element of democratic political 
ac- countability fails). --If political policy-makers are enabled to utilize sophisticated computer-assisted 
analysis models through utilization of time-share interactive conversational mode formats~ without the 
necessity to know computer programming they may be encouraged to explore policy alternatives which they 
would not if they had to utilize the ser- vices of time-delaying and/or security-leaking assistants. 
 The utilization of such techniques, then, may make computer-assisted public policy analysis projects 
much more useful (and much more likely to be utilized) to policy deci- sion-makers. Just as technological 
developments and potentials in the computer industry pose challenges to political decision-makers, so 
also are challenges posed to the computer specialists to adapt their work and abilities to the environmental 
needs of the policy decision-maker. 80 W z ~ ~ oo o ¢. .J 0 ~ c 0 o w ~ ~ O 0 8.~ °° Hi I oil I.uLu
