 This paper presents the Hyper-Ring (HR) as a hierarchical and scalable ring-based topology which eliminates 
the major disadvantages of large-scale rings. The paper also presents the properties of the HR as well 
as a one-to-one routing algorithm for the HR. With a fixed node degree, a low cost, symmetric properties, 
and a simple routing scheme, the HR topology is very suitable for small-scale to large-scale dedicated 
multicomputer systems as well as for networks of workstations. I. INTRODUCTION Recent advances in network 
and distributed software technology have promoted workstation cluster- based parallel processing in which 
PVM[I-2] or Linda[3] run on workstations interconnected by standard local area networks including rings. 
These advances made parallel processing more affordable and more widely available. Among the more recent 
ring designs are the Cambridge Backbone Ring (CBR) [4], the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) [5], HANGMAN 
[6], and Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Ring Network (CSMA/RN) [7]. Furthermore, recent commercial hierarchical 
virtual shared memory muitiprocessors such as Kendall Square Research's KSR-I[8-9] as well as older multiprocessors 
such as the CDC Cyberplus and the Maryland Zrhob [I0] are based on the ring topology. Both the KSR-i 
and the Cyberplus use a hierarchical 2-level ring network whereas the Maryland Zmob muitiprocessor uses 
a simple slotted token ring network. Moreover, recent interconnects such as the Scalable Coherence Interface 
(SCI)[16] support the ring topology. This is hardly surprising since the ring topology is cheap from 
an implementation perspective. Indeed its cost grows no faster than the number of nodes attached to it 
and its node degree is fixed at two leading to a cheap and simple network interface at each node. Multi-node 
communication operations such as broadcasts are easily implemented over the ring. Due to its symmetry 
and fixed node degree, it is expandable in a simple and straightforward way. The ring is also l-link

ACM 0-89791-969-6/98/0002 3.50 with minimal reconfiguration. However for a large number of nodes, the 
ring suffers from a large diameter and the average communication latency under a uniform message distribution 
is proportional to half the total number of nodes attached to the ring, a very large amount considering 
the fact that a message's transmission time exceeds the execution time of 50 processor instructions. 
For this reason, the ring topology is not suitable for large-scale systems. This paper presents the Hyper-Ring 
(HR) as a hierarchical and scalable ring-based topology which eliminates the most fatal disadvantages 
of large-scale rings. With a fixed node degree, a low cost, symmetric properties, and a simple routing 
scheme, the HR topology is very suitable for small-scale to large-scale dedicated multicomputer systems 
as well as for networks of workstations (NOWs). Interconnecting departmental workstation clusters to 
clusters at a higher hierarchy or interconnecting the high-performance nodes of a dedicated hierarchical 
multicomputer can be simply and cost-effectively achieved with the HR topology. Unlike the hypercube 
[11] and the k-arc n-cube with variable (size-dependent) node degrees, the HR enjoys a fixed node degree 
(2 or 4) which is independent of the system size. This reduces the system cost particularly for large- 
scale systems. Unlike two-dimensional meshes and tori with a node degree of 4 and cube connected cycles 
(CCC) [12] with a node degree of 3, most of the nodes of the HR have a degree of 2 as in their ring counterpart. 
However nodes that serve as gateways to higher hierarchies have a node degree of 4. Thus the number of 
links which reflects the cost of the network is lower for the HR than it is for two-dimensional meshes, 
tori, or the CCC. The paper is organized as follows. In section II, recent ring-based network designs 
are briefly reviewed. Section III describes the construction of the HR. Section IV explores the properties 
of the HR. A one-to-one routing algorithm for the HR is presented in section V. The paper concludes in 
section VI. 2. RING NEqI3htORKS Along with the ethernet, the ring has been a favorite local area network 
(LAN) choice. Among the prominent ring networks are the token ring [13], Cambridge Backbone Ring (CBR) 
[4], HANGMAN [61, and the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB aka IEEE 802.6) [5], some of which are compatible 
with ATM 607 while others are not. Also among recent packet ring LANs is the Carrier Sense Multiple 
Access/Ring Network (CSMA/RN) [7]. Partridge [13] summarized the main features of these networks. The 
ring topology has been adopted in the Zmob multiprocessor system [10] and in the KSR-I [8-9]. The KSR-I 
uses a ring of rings topology and consists of a 2- level cache only memory architecture (COMA) multiprocessor 
system using an ALLCACHE memory and supporting 1088 processors. The KSR-I is an example of a recent commercial 
multiprocessor adopting a hierarchical ring topology. Due to its cost-efficiency, ease of implementation, 
and broadcast and multicast support, the ring has jumped back to the forefront of interconnection topologies 
for multiprocessors and multicomputers. 3. THE HYPER-RING TOPOLOGY In this section, we start with the 
construction of the HR. In the simplest case, an HRI(N0) is a regular ring of N O nodes labeled 0 to 
(NO -1) in a clockwise increasing fashion as depicted in Fig. I. To build an HR2(N0, NI) from an HRI(N0), 
N 1 HRI's are duplicated and labeled 0 to (NI " !) in a clockwise increasing fashion as shown in Fig. 
2. The nodes in each HR 1 are now labeled by the HR! label concatenated with the node's label in the 
HRI. The HRi's are interconnected together on a higher ring, dimension (dimension 2) via nodes X0 and 
XI_No/2.1, where X represents don't care. In this fashion, the HR ! rings are interconnected together 
over a dual ring rather than a single ring to reduce the network congestion and improve the network's 
fault tolerance and bisection width. In larger i-dimensional HRi's (i23), the HRi's labeled X...X0...0 
(with d.1 zeros) of each HR d (where 3<d~i) are interconnected together over dimension d via gateway 
nodes X...X0...0YI and X...X0...0Y(LN0 / 2J +1), where Y= d -3 and the number of shown zeros between 
"X" and "Y" in these node labels is also d -3. For instance, to build an HR4, the HR i's labeled X00 
in 2 or more HR3's are interconnected together over dimension 4 via nodes X011 and X01(LNo/2J +!). In 
general, a HRi (NO, NI ..... Ni. 2, Ni.l) is constructed by interconnecting together the i-dimensional 
gateway nodes of N i HRi.I(N0 , N 1 ..... Ni.3, Ni.2)'s via symmetrically-positioned dual rings. Higher 
dimensioned HWs can be recursively built in this fashion. Fig. 3 depicts the HR3(6, 4, 4). The gateway 
nodes of the HR3(6 , 4, 4) to dimension 5 are nodes 021 and 024. Note that NI=0 for i=l, NI>2 for i=2, 
3, or 4, and N12 i - 2 for i25. In other words, NI=2 can support HR 2, HR 3, and HR4, N i=3 can support 
HR~ to HR5, and N !=4 can support HR 2 to HR 6 and so on. m generm, N l=k can support HR2 to HRk+ 2. 
Generally, the node labels in HRi are i digits long starting with the label (i-i digits long) of the 
HR i to which the nodes belong followed by the node's number in that HR 1. This can be repeated until 
the top-most hierarchy (HRi.I) is reached. For instance, in Fig. 3, the 4 HR2's of the HR3(6, 4, 4) are 
labeled O, !, 2, and 3 in a clockwise increasing fashion. The HR 1 rings in the bottom left HR 2 (labeled 
3) are labeled 30, 31, 32, and 33 in an clockwise increasing fashion. The nodes of the HR ! ring (labeled 
32) at the bottom of the HR2 labeled 3 are labeled 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, and 325 in a clockwise increasing 
fashion. 4. PROPERTIES OF THE HR The HR. is symmetric but not fully symmetric (not all nodes are connected 
to a higher dimension) as in the Hypercube. Like the Cube Connected Cycles (CCC) [12], it sacrifices 
full symmetry for a lower node degree and consequently a lower network cost. Indeed the CCC drops the 
full symmetry of the hypercube for a fixed node degree of 3. The HR is very similar to the CCC in the 
sense that at the lower level the nodes are connected in a ring (cycle) fashion. Two major differences 
are striking at first glance. In the CCC, each node, of degree 3, serves as a gateway to the next dimension, 
whereas in the HR "regular" nodes which have degree 2 are not directly connected to the higher dimension 
while "gateway" nodes, of degree 4, connect the ring to a higher dimension. The other difference is that 
the rings of the CCC are interconnected in a hypercube fashion whereas the rings of the HR are interconnected 
in rings. In this sense, it is fair to say that the HR is more symmetric than the CCC because it uniformly 
employs the same interconnection function in all dimensions. This difference also makes the routing simpler 
and more uniform in the l-lg than it is in the CCC. The ring is tolerant of one link fault. One broken 
link transforms the faulty ring into a healthy line bordered by the two nodes which are located on the 
two sides of the faulty link. To bring the fault tolerance of rings up and to reduce the diameter of 
large-scale rings, chordal rings of degree 3 (one extra link is added to each node) or 4 (two extra links 
are added to each node) have been introduced. The Hit has the advantage of a lower node degree over chordal 
rings. Unlike chordal rings, the HR also can be simply adapted to interconnect networks of workstations. 
Next, we present the basic quantitative properties of the HR. Property I: The number of nodes in the 
HR i (N 0, N 1 ..... Ni.l) is given by i-! Num) = j[-[=O N j ( ! ) : The number of links in the HR i 
(N 0, N i,..., ~ s given by LI(N0 ) = N O for i=l L2(N0, N 1) = (N0+2) N ! for i=2 Li(No, N I ..... Ni. 
i) =('"(((NO +2)Ni +2)N2 +2)...)Ni. 1 i-! i-! i-i =2 E ([1 N k) -I'INj fori~3 (2)j~0 k=j j=o For instance, 
the HR3(6, 4, 4) of Fig. 3 has 6x4x4--'96 nodes and 6x4x4+2x4x4 +2x4= 136 links. Property 3: The diameter 
of HR i (N 0, N 1 ..... Ni.I), d i , Which represents the maximum distance between any pair of nodes 
is given by dl(NO) = LNo / 2] for i=l ] i-2 / / / /  + E iN./2/)+/Ni.,/2/,.-., fori 3 (3, j = i L J/ 
J 608 The "1" term in the above equation represents the hop from the X0 (or X[No/2.], whichever i.s 
closer) gateway node to the h!gher dimension XI (or X(LNo / 2.1 ~ + 1), whichever ts closer) gateway 
node. The "1_ [No / 2] / 2/" term represents the maximum number of hops needed to exit the HRI ring (over 
the shortest path). In this term, N O is divided by 2 twice owing to the presence of two 2nd dimension 
gateway nodes in each HR 1 ring. For instance, the diameter of the HR3(6, 4, 4) of Fig. 3 is 10. This 
maximum distance interconnect one of {021,022, 024, 025} to one of {221,222, 224, 225} or alternatively 
one of {121, 122, 124, 125} to {321, 322, 324, 325}. The diameter represents an upper bound on the delay 
in the congestion-free and deadlock-free network or a lower bound on the communication time between a 
maximally-distanced pair of nodes, Both the number of links and the diameter affect the network cost. 
: The bisection width, defined as the minimum links needed to be removed from one HR i to yield two equally 
sized HRi.l'S is 4 (for i>l) because a dual ring interconnects smaller HR's to a higher dimension HR 
and cutting two rings in half requires 4 cuts. Thus the bisection width of HR is twice that of a ring. 
Table I compares the parameters affecting the network cost and latency for the HR and the most popular 
network topologies for a system size of around 100 nodes. As demonstrated by Table I, the HR has the 
lowest node degree and number of links (except for the CCC-4 with an unfairly lower node count of 64) 
at the expense of a low bisection width. The diameter of the HR is surprisingly competitive with the 
CCC and Torus considering its low cost. Its diameter is significantly better than that of the popular 
2D Mesh. 5. ROUTING In this section, we develop a distributed one-to- one routing algorithm for the HR 
network. This simple and nonadaptive algorithm is depicted in Fig. 4 and reflects the symmetry (as well 
as the asymmetry) of the HR topology. The algorithm takes a message packet M and the destination's ID 
for input and makes a copy of the message for the current node if the current node's ID matches the destination 
ID, otherwise it directs the message packet to one of its neighbors such that the message travels to 
its destination over the shortest path possible. The current node M is represented by its ID Mi.l... 
M2MIM0, the destination, D, is represented by its ID Di. I... D2DID0, and di (a, b~-min(la-bl, N i -la-bl). 
The algorithm attempts to deliver the message over the higher dimension links first as it starts by comparing 
the most significant bits of the destination and the current node's IDs. If the most significant bits 
of M and D are different, and M happens to be a gateway node to the unmatched higher dimension then the 
message is directly sent to the neighbor on that dimension. Since on a ring a packet can travel either 
clockwise or counterclockwise, M sends the packet on that higher dimensioned ring to the neighbor which 
is closer to D. This is reflected in the two choices for U. If M is not a gateway node to the unmatched 
higher dimension, and does not belong to HR d -which is the HR 1 ring which contains the gateway node 
to that higher dimension- but happens to be a gateway node to the 2nd dimension (in the terminology of 
Fig. 2), then the packet is directed to the neighboring HRI ring which is nearest to HR d. This is reflected 
in the two choices for X. Otherwise if M is not a gateway node to any dimension, then the message is 
directed to the nearest 2rid dimension gateway node. If the most significant bits of D and M match, the 
algorithm moves on to the next lower bits and repeats the above. If all bits of D and M match down to 
bit 2 but DI;~M 1, the packet is sent to the neighboring HR, 1 ring nearest to D ifM happens to be a 
2nd dimension gateway node, otherwise the packet is directed to the 2rid dimension gateway node nearest 
to M. To illustrate how the algorithm works, say source node S=221 wants to send a packet to destination 
node D--035 in the HR3(6 , 4, 4) of Fig. 3. Initially M is 221(=S). Since D2,M 2 the packet is directed 
by S to the nearest 2nd dimension gateway node 220. When the packet reaches node 220, the algorithm seeks 
to route the packet to the nearest 3rd dimension gateway node (node 201) and thus sends the packet to 
node 210. Note that node 201 (actually 200) can be reached on the 2nd dimension ring either clockwise 
or counterclockwise because both paths are equal in length and thus the algorithm could have chosen node 
230 instead of 210 without any significance. The packet continues its counterclockwise path to node 200 
which reroutes it to node 201. At this point, gateway node 201 seeksto deliver the packet over the 3rd 
dimension to the gateway node which belongs to the HR3 that contains D, i.e. node 001. Towards that end, 
node 201 routes the message to node 301 (node 101 could have been chosen because the clockwise and counterclockwise 
paths connecting 201 and 001 are equal in length). Next, node 301 routes the packet to node 001. We have 
now reached a node for which the body of the first IF conditional statement of the algorithm is skipped 
since D and M now have identical most significant bits. Since DI*MI, node 001 directs the packet to the 
nearest 2rid dimension gateway node (000). Node 000 routes the message to node 030. At this point bits 
2 and 1 of D and M are identical so node 030 routes the packet in a counterclockwise direction to I)--035. 
Thus the total 9-hop route traveled by the message is S=221--~ 220"->210--->200-->201 ---> 301 -"> 001-'> 
000--~030--->035=D. 6. CONCLUSION As network of workstations-based parallel processing becomes more and 
more common, scalable network topologies with a low cost, supporting a wide range of number of nodes 
(small scale to large scale), and requiring the fewest modifications to existing LAN-connected PCs and 
workstations, become more and more desirable, Furthermore, scalable multicomputer intercon- nection costs 
have risen sharply for large-scale dedicated multicomputers based on network topologies with variable 
(size-dependent) node degrees. In this paper, we presented the Hyper-Ring (HR), a hierarchical and scalable 
ring-based topology which eliminates the most fatal disadvantages of large-scale rings. The paper described 
the simple and recursive construction of the HIL discussed and analyzed some of its major properties, 
and presented a distributed routing algorithm for the HR. For a fixed number of nodes (about 100), the 
HR's cost was shown to be lower than many of its competitors and its diameter was comparable to that 
of the CCC and 2D Toms and superior to that of the 2D Mesh. With a fixed node degree, a low cost, symmetric 
properties, and a simple routing scheme, the HR topology is very suitable for small-scale to large-scale 
dedicated multicomputer systems as well as for networks of workstations. 609 ~.i ": ~" +'-~:'~., "~
