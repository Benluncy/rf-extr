 A POLYNOMIAL REDUCTION FROM MULTIVARIATE TO BIVARIATE INTEGRAL POLYNOMIAL FACTORIZATION.* Erich Kaltofen 
University of Delaware Abstract Given an arbitrary but fixed integer r e 3. We show that testing r-variate 
polynomials with integer coefficients for irreducibility is m- reducible in polynomial time of the total 
degree and the largest coefficient length to testing bivariate polynomials for irreducibility. Factoring 
r-variate polynomials into irreducibles is polynomial time Turing-reducible to completely factoring bivariate 
polynomials. i. Introduction Algorithms for factoring multivariate poly- nomials with integer coefficients 
have been studied extensively in the literature. One hundred years ago L. Kronecker introduced a reduction 
from multivariate to univariate factorization [KRONi882, p.ll] which has since become a popular device 
in polynomial arithmetic. In 1969 H. Zassenhaus discovered the applicability of the Hensel lemma of p-adic 
analysis to the factorization problem whose multivariate counter- part has been used successfully in 
the past decade (cf. [MUSD75], [WANG78], [ZIPR81]). This method also reduces the problem to first factoring 
a univariate polynomial derived from the input polynomial by evaluating all but one variable at certain 
integers. However, the running time of both methods suffers from the fact that in rare cases an exponential 
number of factor candidates obtained from the univariate factorization may have to be tested to determine 
the true factors. It appears natural to ask *This work has been partially supported by the National

works in polynomial time of the size of the input. Before we can state our result we need to clarify 
what we mean by input-size. We will assume that our input polynomials are densely encoded that is all 
coefficients including zeroes are listed. Hence the size of a polynomial with r variables, given that 
the absolutely largest coefficients has ~ digits and the highest degree of any variable is n, is of 
order 0(znr). Let r, the number of variables, be a fixed integer. Then testing r-variate integer poly- 
nomials for irreducibility is polynomially m-reducible to testing bivariate integer polynomials for irreducibility. 
Moreover determining all irreducible factors of r-variate integer polynomials is polynomially Turing- 
reducible to completely factoring bivariate integer polynomials. We wish to mention that in [ADOD81] 
a similar reducibility was conjectured from univariate polynomials to integers. The reduction from bivariate 
to univariate polynomials must also remain an open problem. Furthermore, we remark that there is no known 
algorithm which factors univariate polynomials in polynomial time [KAMS81]. Our proof is based on Kronecker's 
reduction and the idea of using Puiseux series expansions for a certain version of the Hilbert irreducibility 
theorem [FRAW31]. We also have to estimate the coefficient growth of the used power series expansions. 
 We shall briefly outline the organization of this paper. For the sake of clarity we will present the 
proofs for thet~ivariate to bivariate reduction only. However, in section 5 we will briefly sketch how 
our methods generalize to the r-variate case. Section 2 establishes our notation and some well-known 
facts needed in our proofs. In section 3 we introduce a preliminary transformation on our input polynomials. 
The proofs of our main theorems are contained in section 4. Section 6 concludes this paper. 2. Notation 
and Mathematical Background By Z we denote the integers, by Q the rationals and by i/r Z those rationals 
whose denominator divides the integer r; C denotes the complex numbers. If D is an integral domain, 
D[u,v,x] denotes the ring of polynomials in  261 u, v, and x over D; degu(f) denotes the highest degree 
of u in f e D[u,v,x], degu,v(f ) the highest total degree of monomials in u and v in f, and deg(f) = 
degu,v,x(f) the total degree of f. The coefficient of the highest power of x in f is referred to as 
the leading coefficient of f in x, ZCx(f). We call f monic in x if £Cx(f) is the unity of D. As is well-known, 
D[u,v,x] is a unique factorization domain (UFD) provided that D is a UFD. In this case the content of 
f D[u,v,x] in x, cOntx(f), is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all coefficients of f(x) as elements 
in D[u,v]. The primitive part of f in x ppx(f) = I/contx(f) f and we call f primitive in x if f = ppx(f). 
We also note that the total degree of any monomial in a factor of f is less than or equal to the total 
degree of that monomial in f. The infinity norm of f Q[u,v,x], the maximum of the absolute values of 
the rational coefficients of f, will be denoted by Ifl. Let f(x) = azx Z + aZ_ixZ-l+...+a0 , g(x) bmxm+...+b0 
with ai,b j D[u,v]. By Sylx(f,g) we denote the Sylvester matrix of f and g a~ a~_ 1 ... a 0 m rows 
Sylx(f'g)= Im bmbm-lbm-l"" bOaZ a£-i b 0 O ao I "'"  "'" Z rows b m bm_ 1 b 0 Its determinant is the 
resultant of f and g with respect to x and will be denoted by res (f,g) = x det(Sylx(f,g)).  Lemma 
i: Let f and g be given as above. Then degt(reSx(f,g)) ~ ~ degt(g) + m degt(f) for t = u or v.  The 
next lemma establishes coefficient bounds for the factors of multivariate polynomials. Lemma 2: Let 
gl,...,g m C[u,v,x], let f = and let n = degu(f)+degv(f)+degx(f). gl...gm Then, m  Hi=l Igil ~ en 
Ifl with e = 2.71828. Proof: See [GELA60, pp.135-139]. We now can bound the resultant of a factor and 
the cofactor of a polynomial in one variable. Lemma 3: Let f(x) = g(x) h(x) be a non-trivial factorization 
of f C[x] of degree n. Then if M is any (n-l) by (n-l) submatrix of Syl(g,h), its determinant satisfies 
 det(M) ~ ( n~-I 3 n Ifl) n-I Proof: By lemma 2 we know that each entry in M is bounded by 3nlfl. Hadamard's 
determinant inequality then gives the bound.  In theorem 2 of section 4 we will need the algebraic 
closure of polynomial domains and we shall introduce the theory now. Let K be a field of characteristic 
0, K its algebraic closure. By K(t)* we denote the fractional power series domain in t over K, any element 
of which is of the form ~i=_k ai tl/q  with k,q c Z, q e 1 and a. K for i z -k. It is 1 a classical 
result in complex analysis that every algebraic function admits a fractional power series expansion which 
converges in a neighborhood of zero. We state this theorem in its algebraic version as a lemma. Lemma 
4 (Puiseux's Theorem): Kit], the algebraic closure of K[t], can be embedded into K(t)*. Proof: See [VdWA39, 
pp.50-54]. We write K(u,v)* for (K(u)*)(v)* and notice that K(u,v)* contains the algebraic closure of 
 K[u,v]. 3. Initial Transformations  In this section we will review some well- known methods which 
will make the input poly- nomials monic and squarefree. We first notice that all arithmetic operations 
on Z[u,v,x] including substitutions and GCD computations take time polynomial in the input size (cf. 
[KNUD81, pp.399-416]). Let f Z[u,v,x] be our input polynomial which we want to factor or prove irreducible. 
 First we separate the content and primitive part of f by calculating the GCD of all coefficients of 
f(x). We then squarefree decompose the primitive part of f, f = ppx(f), by repeated multivariate GCD 
computations of the type GCD(f,~f/3x) [YUND76]. We now proceed with factoring all squarefree factors 
of f. Let g be  such a factor. A standard technique makes g monic in x. Let n = degx(g) , c(u,v) = 
ZCx(g) and let h(u,v,x) = c(u,v) n-I g(u,v,x/c(u,v)) .  Then h is monic in x and a complete factorization 
of h = hl...h m gives a complete factorization of g g(u,v,x) = Hi=im ppx(hi(u,v,c(u,v),x) ) [KNUD81, 
p.438, exercise 18].  Finally we translate the variables u = u+a and v = v+b With a,b Z such that 
h(],~,x) = h (u+a,v+b, x)  is squarefree at u = 0 and v = O. To show that we can find such integers 
a and b in polynomial time we prove the following lemma. Lemma 5: Lee h(u,v,x) Z[u,v,x] be squarefree 
(in x) and let d = max(degu(h),degv(X)). Then there exist integers a and b with 0 N a,b ~ 2d2-d such 
that h(a,b,x) Z[x] is also squarefree. Proof: Since h is squarefree its discriminant D(u,v) = resx(h,Sh/Sx 
) # 0 [VdWA53, p.86]. By lemma 1 the highest degree of any variable is 2d2-d. If we write D(u,v) as 
a polynomial in (Z[u])[v] not all coefficients in Z[u] can be zero. Since their degrees in u are bounded 
by 2d2-d, not all of the 2d2-d+l numbers 0,1,...,2d2-d can be roots of one particular non-vanishing 
 coefficient. Therefore there exists an integer a with 0 ~ a ~ 2d2-d and D(a,v) # 0. The same argument 
shows the existence of a proper b. The above len~a shows that we at most have to test (2 deg(h)) 2 
pairs of points a and b. Testing whether h(a,b,x) is squarefree is again a GCD computation as mentioned 
above. 4. Main Theorem In the next lemma and theorem the following predicate repeatedly appears under 
a summation sign and we shall therefore introduce a separate symbol for it, namely ~(i,j,s,t) ~ 0~s~i 
and 0~t~j and l~s+t~i+j-i . The following lemma estimates the size of a general version of Calalan numbers. 
 Lemma 6: Let d01 = dl0 = 1 and let dij = ~(i,j,s,t) dstdi-s,j-t for i ~ 0, j ~ 0, i+j ~ 2. Then  
= (2 (i+j)-21 ~ 8(i+J ) dij i+lj i+j-i " i!j ! < with (~) denoting the usual binomial coefficient. 
 Proof: Let G(u,v) = [i+j_>l dij ulv3 be a generating function for dij. Then G(u,v) 2 = G(u,v)-(u+v) 
 and thus G(u,v) = i/2(l-/(l-4(u+v))) = oo 2k-2 k [k=l I/k ( k_l ) (u+v) which yields one formula. 
The estimate (~) < 2 C~ then implies our inequality. [~ Our first theorem estimates the coefficient 
growth of a power series expansion for our trans- formed input polynomial. Theorem i: Let f(u,v,x) e 
Z[u,v,x] be monic of degree n in x such that f00(x) = f(0,0,x) is squarefree. Let g00(x) h00(x ) = 
f00(x ) be a non- trivial factorization of f00(x) in Z[x] i.e. g00(x) Z[x] and 1 <- deg(g00 ) < n. 
 Then there exist unique polynomials gij (x), hij (x) with i ~ 0, j _> 0, i+j ~> 1 and deg(gij ) < deg(go0), 
deg(hij) < deg(h00) such that ( co f(u,v,x) = ([~',j=0 gij(x)ulv3) [i,j=0 hij(x)uivJ)" Furthermore, 
let R = res(g00,h00 ) and let T be an upper bound for any (n-l) by (n-l) subdeterminant of Syl(g00,h00 
) (see lemma 3). Let N = max(n2,nlfl) and let d.. be as defined in lemma 6. 13 Then for all i a 0, 
j ~ 0, i+j z 1 gij(x) and hij (x) (i/R2(i+j)-iZ)[x] and both Igijl, lhijl ~ dij(NT) 2(i+j)-I Proof: 
The existence of gij and hij follows from lemma 4 or from the Hensel lemma which we will also use to 
obtain our estimates. Let f..(x) denote the coefficient of the monomial Iv3 in f as an element of (Z[x])[u,v]. 
Since f is monic in x, deg(fij ) < n for all i+j a i. Hence for all i ~ 0, j ~ 0, i+j a 1 the polynomials 
gij' hij are uniquely determined by the given degree bounds, (i) g00(x)hij(x) + h00(x)gij(x ) = bij(x 
) with b01(x ) = f01(x), bl0(X ) = fl0(X ) and for i+j ~ 2. (2) bij(x ) = fij(x) -[~(i,j,s,t)gst(X)hi_s,j_t(x) 
" Now let Cij = max(IgijI,lhijI,Ifl) and let Bij = Ibij I. Since deg(gst ) < deg(go0 ) and deg(hi_s,j_ 
t) < deg(h00) we can conclude that Igsthi_s,j_t I ~ (n-l) IgstIlhi_s,j_tl (n-l)CstCi_s,j_ t. Observing 
that any Cst is at least of size Ifl we obtain from (2) (3) Bij ~ n[~(i,j,s,t)CstCi_s,j_ t for i+j 
e 2 . If we solve (i) by undetermined coefficients for gij and hij we encounter Syl(g00,h00 ) as the 
 coefficient matrix, namely (4) (gij'~ij) Syl(g00'h00) = ~ij for i+j ~ 1 . By p we mean the coefficient 
vector (pm,Pm_l,...,p0) of the polynomial p(x) = Pmxm+...+p0 . Using Cramer's rule for (4) and the 
fact that det(Syl(g00,h00)) = R is an integer not equal to zero (f00 is squarefree) we get the estimate 
 (5) Cij s max(Ifl,n Bij T) . Our claims now follow by induction on i+j. Case i+j = i: Since bol,bl0 
 Z[x], Cramer's rule applied to (4) yields g01,gl0,h01,hlo (1/R Z)[x]. Also B01,Bi0 s Ifl and hence 
by (5) C01,Ci0 ~ n Ifl T ~ NT = doiNT = dloNT. Case i+j e 2: Applying the hypothesis to (2) we obtain 
bij (i/R2(i+j)-2Z)[x]. Again by Cramer's rule we conclude from (4) that gij,hij (I/R2(i+j)-Iz)[x]. 
By the hypothesis we get from (3) that  C C Bij -< n[~(i,j,s,t) st i-s,j-t < n (NT) 2 (i+j)-2 X~ 
 (i,j, s, t) dstdi-s,j-t  = n(NT) 2(i+j)-2 d... lj By (5) we finally obtain Cij -< max(Ifl,nBijT ) 
~-dijn2/N(NT)2(i+j)-i _< d.. (NT) 2(i+J )-I 13 Our second theorem is the essence of our paper and states 
that if the above polynomial f(u,v,x) is irreducible then for any integer exponent s the polynomial 
f(u,cuS,x) remains irreducible for almost all integers c. The difficulty is to show that c can be chosen 
poly- nomially large.  Theorem 2: Let f(u,v,x) c Z[u,v,x] be monic of degr_ee n in x such that f(0,0,x) 
is squarefree. Let R be the maximum of all R = res(g00,h00) derived from any non-trivial factorization 
 f(0,0,x) = g00(x)hoo(X) in Z[x] and let T be an upper bound of any (n-l) by (n-l) subdeterminant of 
all Syl(g00,h00). Furthermore assume that f(u,v,x) is irreducible. Let d = degu,v(f). Then for any 
given positive integer s and for any integer c with Icl -> 4sd ~4sd-i 82s2d(N~)4s2d-i f(u,cuS,x) is 
irreducible in Z[u,x]. Proof: By lemma 4 and the subsequent remark the polynomial gc,s(U,X) = f(u,cuS,x) 
has n roots in Q(u)* and f(u,v,x) has n roots in Q(u,v)*. Each of the roots of gc,s corresponds to a 
root of f with v = cu s. Hence each factor of gc,s(U,X) Q(u)*[x] corresponds to a factor of f(u,v,x) 
Q(u,v)*[x] with v=cu s . We will show that for an integer c of the stated size no factor derived from 
f in such a way can be an integral poly- nomial dividing gc,s" Our plan is the following: We first show 
that any candidate factor h(u,v,x) of f(u,v,x) e Q(u,v)*[x] contains at least one monomial b uPvqx m 
with b # 0 and pqm pqm sd < p+q _< 2sd. From it we get a monomial t(c)uP+SqxTM in h(u,cuS,x) where t(c) 
is a non- zero po.~ynomial in c. Since degu(gc, s) <_ sd no polynomial factor of gc,s has a higher degree 
in u. By choosing c larger than the absolute value of any root of t(c) we force degu(h(u,cuS,x)) -> 
p+sq > sd and hence h(u,cuS,x) cannot be a poly- nomial dividing gc,s(U,X). Theorem i will assist us 
to estimate the size of any root of t(c). Let h(u,v,x) = Ik=0 l~.,j=O bijkUlV3X k be the product of 
Z linear factors of f(x) with coefficients in Q(u,v)* and let h(u,v,x) = n-£ " " ~k=O ~,j=O bijk ulv3xk 
be its cofaetor, i.e. f = hh. We first can assume that h(O,O,x) ~ Z[x]. Otherwise h(u,cuS,x) could not 
be an integer poly- nomial at all. Now there must exist at least one bij k or bij k with sd < i+j ~ 
2sd and bij k # 0 or bij k # 0. To see this assume the contrary. Then (~=0 ~i+j<sd bijkuivJxk) (Tn-Z~k=0 
~i+j<sd- bijkuivJxk) = f(u,v,x) since no monomial %ulvJx k with sd < i+j ~ 2sd in the left product could 
be canceled by higher terms in the product of the complete expansions h and h. However, f was assumed 
to be irreducible. Without loss of generality we now can assume the existence of p, q and m such that 
b # 0 with pqm sd < p+q ! 2sd. We collect all non-zero b.. 13m with i+sj = p+sq and select among them 
b with yzm z maximal. Then the following inequalities are easily verified (i) z ~ y+z ~ 2sd and sd 
< i+sj ~ 2s2d for i+sj = p+sq . We now consider the coefficient t(c) of uP+Sqx m in h(u,cuS,x), namely 
 t(c) = byzmcZ+...+bpqmCq+...+bp+sq,0,m It is well known that the absolute value of any root ~ of a 
polynomial F(x) £ C[x] is bounded by I~I ~ 2 deg(F) IFl/l~c(F) I By Theorem I with gOo(x) = ~=0 b00 
kxk and n-Z  ho0(X) = ~k=0 b00 kxk it follows that byzm i/R2(Y+Z)-iz. Since b # 0 we conclude from 
 yzm (i) that ll/byzm I ~ R 4sd-l. Also from theorem 1 and lemma 6 we get Ibijml ~ 8i+J(NT) 2(i+j)-I 
 and again by (i) it follows that Ibijml 82s2d(NT) 4s2d-I for i+sj = p+sq. Finally using (i) once 
more we obtain  (2) 2 deg(t)Itl/IZc(t) I 4sd 8 2s2d (NT) 4s2d-1 R 4sd-1  Thus for any integer c absolutely 
larger than the RHS of (2) we know that t(c) # 0 and therefore h(u,cuS,x) contains a non-zero monomial 
 t(c)uP+Sqx m and cannot be a polynomial factor of gc,s(U,X) as argued above. Our given bound then 
obviously works for any factor candidate h. D We shall provide a corollary to make theorem 2 more palatable. 
 Corollary: Let f(u,v,x) c Z[u,v,x] be monic in x, irreducible and such that f(O,O,x) is squarefree. 
Let s be a given positive integer. Then there exists an integer bound B(Ifl,deg(f),s) of length polynomial 
in log(Ifl) , deg(f) and s such that for every integer c with Icl ~ B(Ifl,deg(f),s) f(u,cuS,x) is irreducible 
in Z[u,x]. Moreover B(If I ~deg(f),s) can be chosen to grow monotonously with ~fl, deg(f) and s. Proof: 
Since all possible g00 and h00 (as defined in Theorem 2) are monic we can bound R = res(goo,h00) ~ 23. 
Since all monomial degrees are not larger than D = deg(f) we obtain the following bounds. (i) T ~ (~ 
3DIfl) D by lemma 3, (2) N s D21fl by its definition in Theorem i, and (3) B(Jfl,D,s) ~ 4sD (2T) 4sD 
82s2D (NT) 4s2D by Theorem 2. The statement including monotoni- city now immediately follows from (1)-(3). 
 We now state and prove our main result for the trivariate case. Theorem 3: Let f(u,v,x) Z[u,v,x]. 
Then there is an algorithm which constructs a polynomial g(y,x) in time polynomial in deg(f) log(If I) 
such that g is irreducible over the integers if and only if f is irreducible over the integers Furthermore 
assume that we possess an "oracle" algorithm which splits any bivariate polynomial h(y,x) e Z[y,x] into 
irreducible integral factors in time polynomial in deg(f) log(Ifl). Then there is an algorithm using 
this oracle which completely factors f into irreducibles over the integers in time polynomial in deg(f) 
log(Ifl). Proof: First we treat the irreducibility test. If after the initial transformations described 
in section 4 f turns out to be non-primitive or non- squarefree then f is composite and we can set 
 g(y,x) to any composite bivariate polynomial Otherwise we can assume that f is monic in x and f(0,0,x) 
is squarefree. All there is not left to do is to compute an integer c > B(Ifl,deg(f),l) with B from 
the previous corollary and to set g(y,x) = f(y,cy,x). If f = flf2 then g(y,x) = fl(Y,cy,x) f2(Y,cy,x), 
while if f is irreducible then by our corollary so must be g. The full factorization part requires 
Kronecker's trick. Again we first compute cont (f) and the squarefree decomposition of x 2 ft Since 
cont (f) involves at PPx (f) = flf2 "'" t" x most 2 variables our oracle can be called directly in order 
to factor it. We proceed to factor all fi and note that t < degx(f) making only poly- nomially many 
applications of the following procedure necessary. Let g be derived from an f 1 as at the end of section 
4 such that g is monic and g(0,0,x) is squarefree. Let D > max(degu(g),degv(g)) and let G be the factor 
coefficient bound for g given in lemma 2. We now compute an integer c > B(G,deg(g),D) with B from our 
corollary and call the oracle with h(y,x) = g(y,cyD,x) . By 1 we denote a modified inverse of the 
 Kronecker reduction performed on the variables u and v only, taking also into account the multiplier 
c: SD 1 is additive and if %yi+Dj is a l(%yi+Dj monomial with % ~ Z[x], i,j < D then S~ ) = %uZvJ/c 
j. We now claim that if h I is a factor of h then s~l(h divides Since the transformation I)~ g.  Sn 
I can be executed in polynomial time a full factorization of h will yield one for g and applying our 
method for all fi finishes our proof. We finally show our claim. Assume SDi(hl ) does not divide g. 
There exists an irreducible factor gl of g such that h I divides gl(Y,cyD,x). But Igll < G and deg(g 
I) < deg(g) hence gl(Y,cyD,x) remains irreducible by our corollary, in contradiction to its divisibility 
by h I . D 5. The r-Variate Case A complete proof for the general case will appear in [KALE82] but 
the ideas are very similar to the trivariate case. Lemma 6 and Theorem 1 generalize without difficulty. 
Theorem 2 and its corollary can be generalized as follows. If f(u I ..... Ur,X ) e Z[u I ..... Ur,X] 
is monic in x, irreducible and such that f(0,...,0,x) is squarefree then there exists a bound B(Ifl,deg(f),s) 
of length polynomial in log(Ifl), deg(f) and s such that f(ul ,cul,u3,s "'''Ur'X) remains irreducible 
in Z[Ul,nB,...,x] for integers c with Icl ~ B(Ifl,deg(f),s). The proof follows the main line of the 
proofs for Theorem 2 and its corollary with but one complication. The generalization of the main theorem 
then is shown by a simple induction on r. Notice that our reduction can be viewed as to factoring (after 
the initial transformations) a bivariate polynomial D D 2 D r-2 f(xl,ClXl,C2X 1 ,.--,Cr_2X 1 ,x r) 
 with suitably large integers Cl,...,Cr_ 2 and D larger than any single degree of f. This reduction 
appears to be a hyprid of Kronecker's device and the evaluation process. 6. Conclusion An effective 
version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem together with Kronecker's idea lead to our result. Similar 
approaches seem not to work for the reduction from bivariate to univariate factorization. The difficulties 
which arise are twofold. First there seems to be no effective way to compute an evaluation point t o 
 Z for an irreducible polynomial f(t,x) Z[t,x] such that f(t0,x) remains irreducible in Z[x]. We conjecture 
that such a point of length polynomial in deg(f) log(If I) must exist yielding at least a succinct 
certificate for f. On the other hand substituting cx s for t into a root ~(t) e Q(t)* of f(t,x) maps 
the corresponding linear factor x -e(t) into a series domain in x whose factorization properties are 
unclear. As to the author's knowledge these difficulties are yet to be overcome. Acknowledgement: The 
problem of polynomial time reductions was suggested to the author by Prof. George Collins. The author 
also wishes to thank Prof. Bobby Caviness for his encouragement to pursue this approach. REFERENCES
