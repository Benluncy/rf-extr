 The viewer is guided through the history of jazz by examining sculptures that exhibit distinct silhouettes 
when viewed from different angles in a virtual walkthrough of a shadow art museum. Shadow art is a unique 
form of sculptural art that exploits the fact that we can recognize objects from their shadows or silhouettes. 
Improvisation, a key ingredient of jazz, is mirrored in the ambiguity of shadow sculptures, where many 
different 3D shapes can cast the same 2D shadow. The movie highlights five different milestones in the 
evolution of jazz: the early songs of field workers, ragtime, New Orleans jazz, swing, and bebop. Each 
era is represented by a room containing 3D sculptures that cast multiple shadow images at the same time. 
This unique property is achieved using a novel computational method for interactive creation and manipulation 
of shadow art. Given a set of desired silhouette images, a global geometric optimization builds a 3D 
shadow volume that can subsequently be edited by the artist using a set of 3D modeling tools. The reinterpretation 
of jazz and non-jazz music is crucial in jazz pieces. In the same way, a shadow object can be seen as 
a 3D interpretation of the desired 2D shadows. Directors Hardware/Software Dominik Käser Shadow Art Creator
