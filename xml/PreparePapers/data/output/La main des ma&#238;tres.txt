takes its graphical direction from the early 20th century s Art Nouveau and Victorian styles. Beneath 
the graphics is the society of the working class during the industrial revolution as it relates to class 
struggle. The major artistic influence on the overall animation style is the painter Alfons Mucha. From 
this inspiration, everything went to Steam­punk, which contributed more craziness and freed the genre. 
The production culminated as a 2D animation short built with 3D animation tools in one year with a three-man 
team. All the characters were modeled in 3D. They were rigged and animated with cloth simulations and 
rendered with a sort of toon shader. Once animated, using a custom MELScript UI to manage them, they 
were rendered and fixed in 2D to add facials, correcting penetrations, lines, and shadows, and to composit 
everything in an attempt to match 3D characters with non­animated 2D characters and matte paintings. 
Moreover, having 3D characters allowed us to match with 3D visual effects. Directors Adrien CaYuS Toupet
