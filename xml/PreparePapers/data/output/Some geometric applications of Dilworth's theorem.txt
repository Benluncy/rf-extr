 Some Geometric Applications of Dilworth s Theorem J~NOS PACH* Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Dept. 
Comp. Sci., City College, New York pach@cims6.nyu.edu Abstract A geometric graph is a graph drawn in 
the plane such that its edges are closed line seg­ments and no 3 vertices are collinear. We set­tle an 
old question of Avital, Hanani, Erdos, Kupitz and Perles by showing that every ge­ometric graph with 
n vertices and m > k4n edges cent ains k+ 1 pairwise disjoint edges. We also prove that, given a set 
of points V and a set of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, then either there are k + 1 rectangles 
such that no point of V belongs to more than one of them, or we can find an at most 2 . 105 ks element 
subset of V meeting all rectangles. This im­proves a result of Ding, Seymour and Winkler. Both proofs 
are based on Dilworth s theorem *Research supported by Hungarian National Foun­dation for Scientific

[ES] rediscov­ ered Ramsey s theorem [R] to show that out of ~:24 points in the plane it is possible 
to select () n points which form a convex n-gon, combina­torial geometry has been a rich area of appli­cation 
for Ramsey theory (see [GRS] ). Many classes of geometric objects can be equipped with natural ordering 
relations, and this infor­mation is often lost when we apply Ramsey s theorem. For example, given n convex 
bodies in the plane, Ramsey)s theorem only implies that we can choose ~ log2 n of them which are either 
pairwise disjoint or pairwise intersect­ing. However, as we have shown in a recent paper [LMPT], one 
can also choose nl/5 ele­ments with the above property. Our proof was based on the following wellknown 
result [D]. Dilworth s Theorem Let P be a parizalzy or­ dered set containing no chain (totally ordered 
subset) of k + 1 elements. Then 1 can be COV­ ered by k antichains (subsets of pairwise in­ comparable 
elements). In this note we shall present some further applications of the same idea. A geomet~ic graph 
G is a graph drawn in the plane by (possibly crossing) line segments, i.e., it is clefinecl as a pair 
(V(G), E(G)), where V(G) is a set of points in the plane in general position and E(G) is a collection 
of closed line segments whose endpoints belong to V(G). The following question was raised by Avital ancl 
Hanani [AH], Kupitz [K] ancl Perles: De­termine the smallest number e~(n) such that any geometric graph 
with n vertices and m > e~(n) edges cent ains k + 1 pairwise disjclint edges. An old result of Hopf and 
Pannwitz [HP] and Erdos [E] implies that e,(n) = n. Alon and Erclos [AE] showed that e2(n) ~ 6n, which 
was subsequently improvecl by O Donnel ancl Perles [OP] and Goddard, Katchalski and Kleitman [GKK] to 
ez(n) < 3n. In the latter paper it has also been established that e3(7z) < 10n ancl, for any fixed k, 
e~(n) < ckn log~-3 n with a suitable constant c~. Theorem 1 Any geometric graph with n ver­tices and 
more than k% edges contains at least k + 1 pairwise disjoint edges. This means that ek(n) s k4n for all 
k and n. Moreover, we can show that if a geometric graph has much more than e.~(n) edges then it has 
many (k + 1)-tuples of pairwise clisjclint eclges. Theorem 2 J o~ eve~y k the~e ezists CL :> 0 such that 
any geometrzc graph with n vertices and m > k4n edges has at least c~m2~f~/nz~ (k+ 1)-tuples of pairwise 
disjoint edges. PuT­ ihermore, this bound is asymptotically tight apart from the exact value of c~. Our 
next result can also be established by repeated application of Dilworth s theorem. It is a substantial 
improvement of a theo­rem of Ding, Seymour and Winkler [DSW], whose original proc)f requires moire involved 
techniques. Theorem 3 Let V and R be a set of poznt.~ and a set of axis-parallel rectan~gles in the plane, 
respectively. Then for any natural num­ber k, either (i) there are k + 1 rectangles in 72 so that no 
point of V belongs to more than one of them, or (ii) one can choose at most 2. 105k8 points of V so 
that every member of 7? contains at least one of them.  In [DSW] the same result was proved with (k+ 
63)127, instead of 2. 105k8. 2 Geometric Graph/s First we prove Theorem 1. Let G be a geomet­ric graph 
on n vertices and m edges, contain­ing no k + 1 pairwise disjoint edges. Let x(v) and y(v) denote the 
~-coordinate and the y­coordinate of a point v, respective] y. For any two edges e = 7J1vZ, e = vjvj 
G E(G), we say that e precedes e (in notation, e << e ) if X(vl) ~ Z(V( ) and X(V2) < z(vj). Furthermore, 
e is said to lie below e , if there is no vertical line 1 (parallel to the y-axis) which intersects both 
eand e with Y(1n e) 2 y(l n e ). If e is below e , than we shall write e < e . Note that < is not necessarily 
a transitive relation on E(G). Finally, let ~(e) denote the orthog­onal projection of e onto the z-axis. 
Define four binary relations <i (i = 1, ....4) on E(G), as follows. Two eclges can be relat ecl by any 
of these relations only if they are dis­joint. Given two disjoint edges e, e c E(G), let e<1 et if e<<e 
and e< e , e~ze if e<< e ancl e> e , e <3 e if 7r(e) ~ 7r(e ) ancl e < e , c <4 e if m(e) S 7r(e ) ancl 
e > e . It follows reaclily from the clefinitions that (a) each of the relations <; (i = 1, ....4) is 
transitive, (b) any pair of disjoint edges is compared by at least one of the relations -+ (i = 1,..., 
4).  None of the partial orders (13(C), <;) con­tains a chain of length k+ 1, otherwise G would have 
k + 1 pairwise disjoint edges. By Dil­worth s theorem, for any Z, E(G) can be parti tioned into at most 
k classes so that no two eclges belonging to the same class are com­ pared by <i. Superimposing these 
four par­titions, we obtain a decomposition of E(G) into at most k4 classes Ej (1 < j < k4) so that no 
two elements of Ej are related by any <~. Hence, by @), none of the classes Ej con­tains two disjoint 
edges, which implies that ]Ej/ < cl(n) = n. Therefore, m = IE(G)I = @_l Il?j I s k n, as desired. l Next 
we deduce Theorem 2 from Theorem 1, by using an idea of Ajtai, Chv6.tal, New­born ancl Szenler6di [ACNS]. 
Given a geomet­ric graph G with n vertices and m 2 e~(n) + n edges, let ~(G) denote the number of k + 
1­tuples of pairwise disjoint edges in G. We are going to show, by induction on n, that (*) f(G) > (6k)- 
(2;+2)(5)2 + whenever m ~ e~(n) + n. Itfollows from Theorem 1 that f(G) > m ek(n), which is stronger 
than (*) if e~(n) + n s m s e~(n) + 2n, and it also shows that (*) holds for n = k4 +3. Suppose now that 
n > k4+3, m > e~(n)+2n and that we have already established the above inequality for all graphs with 
at most n 1 vertices. For any v c V(G), let d(v) clenote the number of edges of G incident to v, and 
let G v stand for the graph obtained from G by the deletion of v. Using the induction hypothesis, we 
get (n-2k-2)f(G) = ~ f(G -v) ~ v6V(G) () n 1 (6k)- k ~::+:k+l~ (m -d(.)) + () VCV(G)2 (Notice that G 
v has at least m (n 1) 2 e~(n 1)+(n 1)edges.) However, by .Jensen s inequality, m cl(v))2k+1 > 2( 
v~V(G) ~b 2k 2k+1 (n_ ~)2k+lm2k+l x (~ -d(v)) = ~2k ? ( VEV(G) ) and (*) follows. This proves the first 
part of Theorem 2. To show that for any fixed k the bound is tight up to a constant factor clepending 
OCJy on k, assume that n s m ~ n2/16 and set ~ = \&#38;J. Divide a circle into 2t equal arcs Al, ...A2t, 
and pick n vertices on the circle as equally clistributed among the arcs as possible. .Join every vertex 
belonging to Ai to all vertices in Ai+~ by line segments (1 < z < t). The re­sulting geometric graph 
has 72 vertices and at least m eclges. Furthermore, for any (k + I.)­tuple of pairwise clisjoint eclges 
of G, there ex­ists an i such that all endpoints of these edges lie in Ai U A;+t. Thus, the number of 
these (k+ 1)-tuples cannot exceed 72 z~+z < (loTn) ~+ /r12k, t [jjl completing the proof of Theorem 
2. R 3 Systems of points and rectangles In this section we are going to establish Theo­ rem 3. Let V 
be a set of points and R a set of axis­ parallel rectangles in the plane. Two rectang­ les R, S c 7? 
are said to be almost disjoint if R n S contains no element of V. For any R c XI, let 7rz(R) and TV(R) 
denote the or­ thogonal projections of R onto the z-axis and onto the y-axis, respectively. Given two 
inter­ vals 1, J on the x-axis (or on the y-axis), we say that 1 precedes J (or, in notation, I << J) 
if the left and right endpoints of 1 precede the left ancl right endpoints of J, respectively. Define 
eight binary relations <i (i = 1, ....8) on %2, as follows. Two rectangles can be re­lated by any of 
these relations only if they are almost disjoint. Given a pair of almc)st disjoint rectangles R, S C 
R., let R<3S if It follows from the definitions that (a) each of the relations <i (i = 1, ....8) is transitive, 
 (b) any pair of almost clisjoint rectangles is  comparable by one of the relaticms <i (i = 1 ~...? 
8). We can assume without loss of generality that none of the partial orders (R, <~) cent ains a chain 
of length k +1, otherwise condition (i) of the theorem holds. Hence, by thle repeated application of 
Dilworth s theorem, we obtain that X can be partitioned into k8 classes l+ (1 < j s k ) so that no pair 
of rectangles bel;nging to the same class is comparable by any of the relations <i. This means, by (b), 
that the intersection of any two rectangles be­longing to the same class contains at least one point 
of V. To prove the theorem, it is sufficient to show that for any j one can select at most 2 105 points 
of V such that every member of %3j con­tains at least one of them. Lemma 1 Let V be a set of points, 
and let 7?0 be a set of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane such that the intersection of any two members 
contains at least one element of V. Then one can choose at most 2.105 points of V so that every member 
of 7?0 contains at least one of them. ProoE By Helly s theorem, (-lRo # 0. Thus, we can assume without 
loss of gener­ality that the origin (O, O) is contained in ev­er y member of %?O. Suppose, for simplicity, 
that no point of the coordinate axes belongs to V. Let ~ denote the set of all points of V lying in the 
i-th quadrant of the coordi­nate system (i = 1, .... 4). Let ~~ consist of all points (z, y) e Vi for 
which there is no (x , y ) 6 U with x c [0,z], y c [0,y]. Fi­nally, set V = V{ U ... U Vi. Notice that 
(a) if we number the elements of W according to their (say) z-coordinates, then the in­tersection of 
any rectangle R 6 T&#38; with ~ consists of a single interval of consecw tive points (i = 1, . ...4); 
(b the intersection of any two members of RO contains at least one element of V . l_ general theorem 
of Gy&#38;f&#38; and Lehel [GYL] states that, for every p and q, there ex­ists ~(p, q) < co with the 
following property. Let .F be a family of sets, each of them ob­tainecl as the union of p intervals taken 
from p parallel lines. If .F does not have more than q pairwise disjoint members, then one can find at 
most f(p, q) points so that every member of F contains at least one of them. This easily implies, by 
(a) ancl (b), that V has a subset of size ~(4, 1) ~ 2. 105 meeting every member of %&#38;. 0  4 Concluding 
remarks Given a partially ordered set of m elements, in 0(rn2) time one can perform a topological sort 
and find a maximal chain (cf. [CLR] ). Hence, the proof in Section 2 also yields the following result. 
Corollary 1 There is an 0(m2)-izme ,algo­rithm for finding at least (m/n) l/4 pairwise disjoint edges 
in any geometric graph with n vertices and m edges. Note that the proof of Theorem 3 can be easily extended 
to higher dimensions. Theorem 4 Let V and B be a set of points and a set of axis-parallel boxes in Rd, 
respec­ tively. Then, for any natuTal number k, either (i) there are k + 1 boxes in B so that no point 
of V belongs to more than one of them, or (ii) one can choose at most cdk22d- points in V so that any 
member of B contains at least one of them, where cd is a constant depending only on d.  Using some related 
techniques we can also establish the following strengthening of a the­orem of B&#38;rAny and Lehel. Given 
two points ~, y e Rd, let 130x(z, y) denote the smallest box parallel to the axes, which contains z and 
Y. Theorem 5 Any set of points V &#38; Rd con­ tains at most 22 elements Xi (1 < i < 22 ) such that
