NASA Langley Research Center ABSTRACT It is frequently suggested that computer science curricula are 
generated in a vacuum with little or no regard for the "real~world needs" of the student's ultimate employer. 
Furthermore, the question has recently been raised whether computer science programs should prepare their 
graduates to be "tool users" or "tool builders." The panel, composed of distinguished representatives 
from industry and Government, will relate their past experience with computer science graduates and will 
address their immediate personnel needs (i.e., areas of required expertise for new employees). Each panel 
member will then present his candid view of the proposed updates to "Curriculum '68" currently being 
prepared by ACM's Curriculum Committee on Computer Science. 92
