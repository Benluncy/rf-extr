complexion basedonthetimeandtheplace.Each aspectofrainprovidesa uniqueimpression, soexperiencingitin 
distant places and different times would be a new way of shar­ing information. To represent rain, we 
focused on an umbrella as a user interface to connect humans and rain. Generally, peo­pleexperiencerainwithsounds,sights, 
or sometimes smells;how­ever, in our proposed system, we exploit the vibration perceived through an umbrella 
s handletolet peoplefeeltherain.Weimple­mentedavibration-giving mechanismbased onaspeaker andmi­crophone 
not onlytogivevibrationsbut alsotorecordthem sothat they reconstruct rain. Using this mechanism, we propose 
a novel umbrella-likeuserinterface named Funbrella that canrecordand replaytherainwithFUN(Figure1). We 
developedtwointerest­ingapplications. Oneistofeelvarious kinds ofrain,andtheother transmits raintodifferentplacesin 
realtime. Withsuch applica­tions,people canenjoyrainthatisusually annoying. 2 Funbrella Inthis section,we 
describethedetailsofFunbrella sstructure. Peopleperceive thevibrationcausedby raindropshittingthecloth 
of the umbrella through its handle. Since the vibration s strength andtimingareirregularandcomplex,anewmethodis 
necessaryto recordandreplaythe actualvibrationoftheraindrops.Wefocused onaspeaker andamicrophonetorecordandgeneratevibrations.

motions to electric signals that resemble a microphone. The system can store vibration data as well.Funbrellacanalso

en­tertainwith rain.Inthissection,we describetheseapplicationsin detail. Crazy Rain: Participants hold 
Funbrella to experience various kindsof rain thatwerestoredinadvance. In addition,wepro­vide the recorded 
sound of the rain with a speaker because the simultaneous usage of vibrations and sounds creates a feeling 
of being immersed in rain. We recorded not only normal rain with threelevelsofstrengthbutalso such impossible/unlikely 
rainsas waterfromabucketaswellasrainthatis recordedwithsnaketoys, marbles,BBbullets,and spaghetti. Throughthis 
application, par­ticipants canfeel andexperience many unusualtypesof rainwith actual vibrations. Tele-rain: 
Twoparticipants holdFunbrellasapartfrom eachother and one s rain is transmitted to the other, as a telephone. 
Figure 3shows the entire system. The electric signal recorded by thein­put side of the Funbrella is sent 
to its output side and generates the vibration. The Funbrella input can be output and vice versa, so 
Funbrella is bi-directional. This means that participants can changetheirpositionfromeither sendingto 
receivingtheinforma­tionof raindrops.Thisenables participantswhoarein Japanand theUnitedStatestosharetheirrainwitheachotherinrealtime. 
 4 Conclusion Weproposedanew umbrella-likeuserinterface, Funbrella, that recordsandreplaysdifferentkindsofrain 
using vibrations gener­atedbytheprincipleof dynamicspeakersandmicrophones. This userinterface canstoreavarietyof 
rain, andparticipantsexpe­rience not only normalbutalso crazy rainsthattheyhave never experienced before.Inaddition,twoparticipantsindifferentplaces 
can feel each other sraininrealtime. Inthefuture, we areplan­ning to improve the vibration-generating 
mechanism to store and produce many kinds of vibrations. This system might become a brandnewway of sharinginformationbecauseit 
can representthe faintpresenceofhumansor physicalobjectsormovementsassub­tle vibrations. Copyright is
