jplefort1@yahoo.fr ABSTRACT In this paper we show that unlike in Bayesian frameworks asymmetric information 
does matter and can explain dif­ferences in common knowledge decisions due to ambiguous character of 
agents private information. Agents share a common, but-not-necessarily-additive, prior beliefs repre­sented 
by capacities. It is shown that, if each agent s in­formation partition is made up of unambiguous events 
in the sense of Nehring [12, Mat. Soc. Sci. 38, 197-213], then it is impossible that the agents disagree 
on their commonly known decisions, whatever these decisions are: whether pos­terior beliefs or conditional 
expectations. Conversely, an agreement on conditionalexpectations, but not on posterior beliefs, implies 
that agents private information must con­sist of Nehring-unambiguous events. The results obtained allow 
to attribute the existence of a speculative trade to the presence of agents diverse and ambiguous information.

share a common prior probability distribution, and their posterior beliefs for some .xed event are common 
knowledge, then these posteriors must coincide, although they may be conditioned on diverse information. 
Aumann s result has been extended in a num­ber of directions. For instance, [7] showed that the agents 
can neither disagree on the values of common knowledge posterior expectations. [10] proved that the only 
common knowledge posterior trade, among the agents with the same risk attitude, is the zero trade. All 
these results suggested that within Bayesian frameworks, combined with the doc­trine of common priors, 
asymmetric information has less ex­planatory power than has been thought: Di.erences in deci­sions cannot 
be explained solely on the basis of asymmetric information. In this paper we show that asymmetric infor­mation 
does matter and can explain di.erences in common knowledge decisions due to ambiguous character of agents 
private information. In order to explain di.erences in commonly known decisions, [11] advocated to weaken 
the commonness assumption of prior beliefs, while still assuming that the agents are subjec­tive expected 
utility maximizer. Here, we suggest an alter­native approach. We maintain the assumption of common prior 
beliefs, but weaken the additivity requirement by al­lowing the agents to be Choquet expected utility 
maximizer in the spirit of [13]. According to Schmeidler s theory subjec­tive beliefs are represented 
by a normalized and monotone, but-non-necessarily-additive, set function, called a capacity. The notion 
of capacity allow ambiguity and di.erent ambi­guity attitudes to play role when making decision. In the 
presence of non-additive beliefs expected utilities are com­puted by means of Choquet integrals. Throughout, 
we assume that the agents share a common capacity distribution over an algebra of events generated by 
a .nite set of states. Furthermore, each agent is character­ized by a partition over the set of states 
which represents her private information. There are two stages: ex-ante and ex-post. At ex-ante stage 
the agents share identical infor­mation. At ex-post stage, the agents receive private signals, they incorporate 
the receipt of new information by updating their prior beliefs conditional on their private information 
and then they announce their decisions. We consider two types of decisions: posterior capacities for 
some .xed event and conditional Choquet expectations of some .xed action. Our .rst objective is to characterize 
the properties of events commonly known at . if and only if M(.) .E (e.g., see in each agent s information 
partition which guarantee that [1]). it is impossible that the agents disagree on their common knowledge 
decisions. A natural candidate for such events are those events for which probabilistic information is 
given. Recently, several notions of unambiguous events have been suggested, e.g. by [12] and by [14]. 
In Bayesian frameworks all uncertain events are unambiguous. In non-Bayesian se­tups, however, only some 
of them may be unambiguous. We start our analysis by assuming that each agent s information partition 
consists of unambiguous events, while other events may be ambiguous. It turns out that, whenever each 
agent s information partition is made up of unambiguous events in the sense of [12, ] then it is impossible 
that they disagree on their commonly known decisions, whatever these decisions are, whether posterior 
capacities or conditional Choquet ex­pectations. Furthermore, it is shown that even a small de­parture 
from Nehring s notion of unambiguous events may create an opportunity for a disagreement. That is, by 
adopt­ing a weaker notion of unambiguous events, as proposed by [14], it is shown that at some state 
agent s posterior capac­ities for some .xed event are common knowledge, but they are not the same. As 
next we focus on a converse result. It turns out that when observing an agreement in posterior beliefs 
or in posterior expectations for some .xed binary action, nothing can be said about the properties of 
events in agents information partitions. Motivated by these observations we consider the set of more 
general actions. It is shown that an agreement on conditional Choquet expectations for some many-valued 
action implies that each agents private information is made up of N-unambiguous events. Based on the 
previous results, we generalize the no-trade theorem of [10] in the context of ambiguity. It is shown 
that, whenever each agent s information partition is made up of Nehring-unambiguous events then the only 
trade, for which it is common knowledge among the Choquet expected utility maximizers that each of them 
is willing to engage in it, is the zero trade. Thus, ambiguity may be seen as o.ering an intuitive explanation 
for the widely observed speculative activities in the real markets.  2. SETUP 2.1 Knowledge Structure 
We consider a .nite set O of states. An event E is a subset of O. Let A=2O be the set of all subsets 
of O. For any E .OwedenoteO\E, the complement of E,by Ec.There is a .nite group of agents I indexed by 
i =1,...,N.Each agent iis endowed with a partition Pi of O, which represents i s private information 
in the usual sense. It is said that the agent iknows an event E at . if Pi(.) .E. The event that i knows 
E, denoted by KiE, is a set of all states in which i knows E, i.e.: KiE = {. .O: Pi(.) .E}. (1) An event 
E is common knowledge at a state . if everyone knows E at ., everyone knows that everyone knows E at 
., N and so on, ad in.nitum. Let M= .i=1Pi be the meet (i.e. .nest common coarsening) of all agents partitions. 
Denote by M(.)the memberof M that contains .. Then, E is  2.2 Static Choquet Preferences According to 
Choquet expected utility theory of [13] agents beliefs are represented by capacities.A capacity . : A. 
R is a set function such that i) .(Ø)=0,.(O) = 1 and ii) .(E) =.(F) whenever E .F .O. Let X be a set 
of outcomes. Actions f :O .X are mappings from states to outcomes. Let Fbe a set of all actions. A preference 
relation : over F admits Choquet expected utility representation if there exists a utility function u 
and a capacity . such that for any f,g .F: ZZ f : g . u.fd. = u.gd.. (2) OO The expectations are taken 
in the following sense. For a given action f let . : {1,...,n}.O be a bijection which orders the partition 
E.(1),...,E.(n) from most to least fa­vorable events under f, i.e. u(x.(1)) =···=u(x.(n)). The bijection 
. expresses the ranking position of events associ­ated with f.The Choquet integral of f with respect 
to . and u is de.ned as: Z u.fd. = O n-1 X [u(x.(j))-u(x.(j+1))] .(E.(1),...,E.(j))+u(x.(n))(3) j=1 For 
a given capacity . and . de.ne a rank-dependent prob­ability distribution p.. on O as: p.. (E.(j))= .(E.(1),...,E.(j)) 
-.(E.(1),...,E.(j-1)). (4) Then, (3) can be equivalently written as Choquet integral of f with respect 
to the rank-dependent probability distri­bution p .. and u, i.e.: Z n-1 X u.fdp.. =[u(x.(j))] p.. (E.(j)) 
(5) O j=1 In the context of ambiguity it is important to localize events that are unambiguous, i.e. events 
on which agents have some kind of probabilistic beliefs. [12] associate ambigu­ity of events with their 
rank dependence. In particular, he calls an event U unambiguous, henceforth N-unambiguous, if the probability 
attached to the event does not depend the ranking position of U.Let Rbe a set of all possible ranks. 
Accordingly, an event U .A is called N-unambiguous if p.. (U)= .(U) for all ..R.Let AU be the collection 
of all N U N -unambiguous events. [12] showed that AN is always an U algebra. Furthermore, he showed 
that U .AN if and only if for all E .A: .(E)= .(EnU)+ .(EnUc). (6) [14] suggested an alternative de.nition 
of unambiguous events. He calls an event U unambiguous, henceforth Z-unambiguous, if and only if for 
all E .Asuch that E .Uc: .(E .U)= .(E)+ .(U). (7) U Let AZ be the collection of all Z -unambiguous events. 
It is UU U worth to mention that AN .AZ ,since AZ does not need to be an algebra.  2.3 Updating Choquet 
Preferences At interim stage agents are informed that the true state is ., they revise their beliefs 
conditional on Pi(.) and con­struct conditional preferences with regard to their new be­liefs. Throughout, 
we assume that each agent s private in­formation consists of non-null events, that is .(Pi(.)) > 0 for 
all states . .Oand forall i .I. If the true state is ., we denote by :Pi(.) agent i s conditional CEU 
preferences over F given her information Pi(.), i.e. for all f,g .F: f :Pi(.) g .. ZZ u.fd.(·|Pi(.)) 
= u.gd.(·|Pi(.)), (8) OO where .(·|Pi(.)) is a capacity conditional on Pi(.). In the class of probabilistic 
models agents revise their beliefs by using the Bayes rule. In non-probabilistic models there are many 
possible ways how to update beliefs (see [8]). Be­side the Bayes rule there are two common revision rules 
for capacities: the Maximum-Likelihood updating rule, intro­duced by [4], and the Full-Bayesian updating 
rule suggested by [9]. In [5] it has been shown that when updating on N-unambiguous events then the Maximum-Likelihood 
up­dating rule as well as with the Full-Bayesian updating rule coincides with the Bayes rule.  3. AGREEMENT 
THEOREMS 3.1 Suf.cient Condition Let D be a non-empty set of possible decisions. Decisions are determined 
by i s decision function di :O .Dwhich is a function of i s private information, i.e. di(.)= di(Pi(.)). 
We mainly consider two types of decision functions: i)a conditional capacity for some event E .A, di(.)= 
.(E |Pi(.)), (9) or ii) a conditional Choquet expectation for some action f .F, Z di(.)= u.fd.(·|Pi(.)). 
(10) O Let Di(.i)= {. : d(Pi(.)) = .i} be the event that the agent i makes a decision .i. Essentially, 
an agreement theo­rem states that if at some state agents decisions are common knowledge then they must 
be the same the same. Formally, if at some state . * the event T Di(.i) is common knowl-i.I T edge, i.e. 
M(. * ) . Di(.i), then .1 = .2 = ··· = .N . i.I When the decision function di(·) is de.ned as a conditional 
probability (9) and the agreement theorem holds true, we designate this situation as an Agreement in 
Beliefs.When the decision function di(·) is de.ned as a conditional expec­tation (10) and the agreement 
theorem holds true, we term this situation an Agreement in Expectations. In the existing non-Bayesian 
extensions of probabilistic agree­ment theorems, established for instance by [2], the nature of agents 
subjective beliefs is inessential and the decision function may be an arbitrary function. To guarantee 
that the agreement theorem holds it is required, that agents are like-minded and that the decision function 
d(·) satis.es the Sure-Thing-Condition (STC), i.e. for any partition E1,...,En of O it is true that: 
n [ di(E1)= ···= di(En)= .i . d( Ej )= .i. (11) j=1 Note, in the class of probabilistic models, decision 
func­tions such as conditional probabilities as well as conditional expectations satisfy the STC on any 
partition. In non­probabilistic models, however, the decision function may satisfy the STC on some .xed 
partitions, but not on oth­ers. For this reason our .rst objective is to .x a partition and to look at 
properties of events of that partition which are su.cient for a decision function d(·) to satisfy the 
STC on it. It turns out that the decision function di(·), whether it is a conditional capacity or a conditional 
Choquet ex­pectation, satis.es STC on a .xed partition whenever this partition is made up of N-unambiguous 
events. This condi­tion on its own is a su.cient condition for agreement the­orem to hold under ambiguity. 
That is, if each agent i s private information is represented by a partition Pi made up of N-unambiguous 
events, then the agents cannot dis­agree on their commonly known decisions, whatever these decisions 
are: whether conditional capacities or conditional Choquet expectations. Theorem 1. Let . be a common 
capacity distribution on U O and let AN .Abe a collection of N-unambiguous events. Let P1 i,...,Pki,...,Pi 
be the events in i s partition Pi.If K PiU k .AN for all k =1,...,K and all agents i.I, then the following 
statements are true: (i) Agreement in Beliefs holds, (ii) Agreement in Expectations holds.  How strong 
is the su.ciency condition in Theorem 1? In particular, suppose that we adapt a weaker notion of unam­biguous 
events, for instance, the one proposed by [14]. Is the claim still true that a disagreement in commonly 
known decisions is impossible? Example 1 answers this question negatively. Even a small departure from 
Nehring s notion of unambiguous events may create disagreement opportunities. Example 1. Consider two 
agents I = {A,B}, called Anna and Bob, the set of states O= {.1,.2,.3,.4},the set of de­cisions D=[0,1] 
and the decision function de.ned as in (9). Let PA = {{.1,.2},{.3,.4}}and PB = {.1,.2,.3,.4}be the agents 
information partitions. Anna and Bob face the following capacity distribution on A: 1 .(.j )= 10 , for 
any j =1,...,4, .(.j ,.k)= 12 , for any j+ k=5 , .(.j ,.k)= a, for any j+ k =5 where a .[ 1 ; 1 ), 10 
2 6 .(.j ,.k,.l)= 10 , for any j,k,l =1,...,4. Note, all events {.j ,.k}with j+ k =5 are Z-unambiguous, 
but not N-unambiguous. To see this, consider the event {.1,.2} and its complement {.3,.4}. On this partition 
the capacity sums up to one. Now, if these events were N-unambiguous, then according to (6) the capacity 
for the event {.1,.3}were .(.1,.3)= .(.1)+ .(.3)= 1 ,butnot 5 1 2 . One can verify that the capacity 
. satis.es (7). Accord­ingly, AU = {Ø,{.1,.2},{.3,.4},{.1,.3},{.2,.4},O} is Z thecollectionof Z-unambiguous 
events. Therefore, Anna s partition is made up of Z-unambiguous events which are not N-unambiguous. Consider 
the event E = {.1,.3}. At any state Anna and Bob announce their posterior beliefs for the occurrence 
of E given their private information. Given Bob s private information he announces dB (.)= .(E |PB (.)) 
= 1 at any state . . O. Anna 2 has .ner information than Bob and therefore she announces dA(.)= .(E |PA(.)) 
= 1 for all . . O. Note, Anna s 5 decision function dA(·) violates the Sure-Thing Condition on her partition. 
Furthermore, since M =O, the event 11 that Anna s decision is and that Bob s decision is is 52 commonly 
known at any state. But, these decisions are in fact not the same. This shows that, if for one agent 
her private information is made up of Z-unambiguous events, which are not N-unambiguous, than the STC 
is violated and it is possible that the agents end up with agreeing to disagree!  3.2 The Converse Result 
In this section we address the following issue. Suppose that agents decisions satisfy the STC on their 
information parti­tions and that the agents cannot disagree on their commonly known decisions. Can we 
infer something about the nature of agents private information? In principle, the answer is Yes . However, 
what we may infer observing an agreement depends on the type of decisions on which agents agree to agree. 
There are situations in which Agreement in Beliefs is present and nothing can be said about the nature 
of agents private information. The reason is the following one. We can easily .nd a capacity distribution 
and an updating rule such that at some state an agreement on posterior beliefs for some .xed event holds 
true and the agents information partitions are neither made up of N-unambiguous nor of Z-unambiguous 
events. For instance, [6] characterize the family of updating rules for neo-additive capacities, axioma­tized 
by [3], which are necessary and su.cient for Aumann s agreement theorem to hold in the context of such 
beliefs. However, for this type of capacities, by construction, it is impossible that only some sub-algebra 
of events is unam­biguous (the only possible unambiguous algebra is Aas in the probabilistic case). Furthermore, 
it turns out that if at some state . it impos­sible that the agents agree to disagree on conditional 
capac­ities for some event E then it is also impossible at . that they agree to disagree on conditional 
Choquet expectations of binary actions de.ned on the event E. A binary action b = xE y is a function 
which assigns the constant outcome f(.)= x.X to each state .in E and the constant outcome f(.)= y .X 
to each . in Ec . Proposition 1. Let . be a common capacity distribution . on O.Let Pi be i s information 
partition and let di(·) be i s conditional capacity for some event E .A. Suppose that at some state . 
* Agreement in Beliefs holds true. Consider a binary action b = xE y de.ned on the event E.Let di be 
i s conditional Choquet expectation of b. Then, Agreement in Expectations holds true at . * . Thus, for 
the same reason as above, nothing can be said about the nature of events representing agents private 
in­formation when knowing that the agents cannot agree to disagree on expectations for some binary action. 
For this reason we constrain our attention to the whole set of possible actions F and ask again whether 
it is possible to infer something about the nature of events in an agent s partition knowing that the 
agents reached Agreement in Ex­pectations for more general action f. Theorem 2 answers this question 
in the a.rmative. Agreement in Expectations for a many-valued action implies that agents information 
partitions are made up of N-unambiguous events. Theorem 2. Let . be a common capacity distribution on 
O.Let A' be a sub-algebra of A.Let di(·) be the Choquet conditional expectation for some many-valued 
action f in F. If for any information partition P= P1 i,...,Pki,...,Pi iK such that Pki .A' for all k 
=1,...,K and all agents i.I, di(·) satis.es the STC on Pi,then A' is the algebra made up of N-unambiguous 
events.  4. REFERENCES [1] R. J. Aumann. Agreeing to disagree. The Annals of Statistics, 4:1236 1239,
