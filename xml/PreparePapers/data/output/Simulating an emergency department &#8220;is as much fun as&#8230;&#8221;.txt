MD 21801, U.S.A. ABSTRACT The purpose of this project is to improve the operation of Peninsula Regional 
Medical Center s (PRMC) Emergency Department (ED) and decrease patient dissatisfaction with length of 
stay. The goal is to reduce patient throughput times and determine the appropriate staffing levels. An 
additional goal is to aid in identifying other system changes to improve patient and department flows 
in the ED through the use of simulation. 1 INTRODUCTION The objectives of this project are to reduce 
the patient s length-of-stay in the ED, and to decide the appropriate staffing levels for registered 
nurses and technicians. The operating environment of the ED had experienced significant changes in the 
past two years, first was a 160/0reduction in patient visits, second were operational changes that required 
a revision of the productivity system that had not been updated in four years, and last was increased 
patient dissatisfaction with long waiting and treatment times in the ED. The project examined 11 different 
alternatives to improve patient flow and determined the appropriate staffing mix based on patient volume. 
The top three alternatives were: first using a fwt track system in minor care, second the staging of 
patients to the next available treatment room, and third using point-of-care testing. The impact of changes 
is a reduction in patient turnaround time by 38 minutes. 2 OVERVIEW Peninsula Regional Medical Center 
is a 400+ bed tertiary care medical center in eastern Maryland. The ED typically treats 40,000 patients 
per year. The ED is the only level H trauma center on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, it has minor care 
facilities, serves as the regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) base station, and an acute psychiatric 
evaluation center. The ED was experiencing significant changes in its environment: (1) a reduction in 
the number of patient visits over the past two years from 48,000 to 40,000, (2) departmental productivity 
and comparative indicators were declining, (3) the department had recently completed an expansion and 
renovation, and (4) patient dissatisfaction with length-of-stay in the department was increasing. All 
these factors lead the staff and management to believe that a systematic approach was needed to determine 
the appropriate staffing and services levels, and identify other methods to improve patient flow. A project 
team composed of nursing and department management, ED nurses, ED physicians, ED technicians, and management 
consulting was formed to investigate methods to improve these department processes. The team chose simulation 
as a tool to examine the current system and to test any proposed changes. MedModelTM simulation software 
was selected because of easeof use and the graphical interface that allows the visualization of the simulated 
system. 3 CURRENT SYSTEM To build the simulation model the first task for the team, was to collect data 
about the operation of the ED. Data was collected from patient charts, emergency department logs, computer 
information systems, interviews, observations and data collection where information was not available. 
Information about arrival times by hour of day were taken from a three-month sample period. The arrival 
pattern that the department experienced was used to distribute the patient arrivals during the day. Once 
this data was captured, the next step was to flowchart the patient and staff activities. The team developed 
detailed flows for the following nine patient types; abdominal pain, lacerations, fractures, non red 
and yellow trauma (non life threatening), red and yellow trauma (life threatening), medical emergencies, 
cardiac emergencies/clnest pain, assault (sexual and physical), ar{d minor-care. Each of these patient 
care categories were subdivided into five levels of increasing patient acuity. Each flow was a compilation 
of detailed activities fbr 1039 1040 Kirtlancl et a]. each patient type, and acuity, the use of consulting
