 Strategic Change and Information Technology: Simplification and Integration Across the Value Chain 
Philip W. Yetton University of New South Wales, Australia Kim D. Johnston University of New South Wales, 
Australia ABSTRACT Attempts to gain strategic alignment of IT strategy with business strategy have usually 
involved fitting IT management into an established divisional organisation design, rather than using 
IT as one of the strategic drivers of the design. This dominant divisional design is characterised by 
high levels of differentiation, and driven by a desire for bottom-line accountability. The current IT 
management solution to the dual pressures for cost and technology -driven centralisation on the one hand, 
and business driven devolution on the other, has typically involved a federal IT structure, essentially 
fragmenting IT services among the differentiated units and levels of the organisation. In this paper 
we examine these current patterns of IT management, describe their problems, and outline an alternative 
strategic IT perspective. Whereas the dominant design utilises hierarchical structures to achieve differentiation, 
the alternative is concerned with horizontal structures to achieve integration. IT can provide a powerful 
platform for such integration and hence plan a proactive role in business redesign. We illustrate this 
perspective with four Australian case examples of strategic IT management. The complete paper was unavailable 
at the time of this publication.
