 Tezcatlipoca Short Animation contact Robin George robingeorge@southern.edu USA Tezcatlipoca is a three-minute 
animation inspired by the music from Tchaikovsky s Swan Lake. In the tradition of Walt Disney s Fantasia 
, it combines the elements of classical music and imaginative animation to retell the Aztec myth of Tezcatlipoca, 
the deity who descends from heaven in the form of a jaguar. Tezcatlipoca was a senior project at Southern 
Adventist University s School of Visual Art and Design. From September 2007 to January 2009, the film 
moved from conception to completion as a solo project, from storyboards and animatics, to modeling, rigging, 
texturing, preliminary set design, character animation, and ultimately to final sets, backgrounds, lighting, 
rendering, and finally compositing. Director Robin George Story Robin George Art Director Robin George
