 Domatic Partitions and the Lov£sz Local Lemma Aravind 1 Our result. We resolve the problem posed as 
the main open question in [4]: letting 5(G), A(G) and D(G) respectively denote the minimum degree, maximum 
degree, and domatic number (defined below) of an undirected graph G = iV, E), we show that DiG ) > (1 
- oil))5(G)/ln(A(G)), where the "o(1)" term goes to zero as A(G) ~ co. A dominating set of G is any set 
S C V such that for all v E V, either v C S or some neighbor of v is in S. A domatic partition of V is 
a partition of V into dominating sets, and the number of these dominating sets is called the size of 
such a partition. The domatic number D (G) of G is the maximum size of a domatic partition; it is NP-hard 
to find a maximum- sized domatic partition. This is a very well-studied problem especially for various 
special classes of (perfect) graphs: see, e.g., [2, 6, 7] and the references in [4]. Recent interesting 
work of [4] has given the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for the domatic partition problem, 
whose approximation guarantee is also shown to be essentially best-possible in [4]. Let n = [VI, 5 = 
5(G), and A = A(G). It is easy to check that D(G) < 5 + 1. An efficient algorithm to find a domatic partition 
of size (1 -o(1))5/In n is shown in [4], where the o(1) term goes to zero as n increases; thus, this 
is a (1 + o(1)) Inn approximation. It is also shown in [4] that for any fixed e > 0, an (1 -e)lnn-approximation 
algorithm for D(G) would imply that NP C DTIME[n °O°gl°gn)]; hence such an algorithm appears unlikely. 
An interesting point is that this seems to be the first natural maximization problem proven to have a 
O(logn) approximation threshold. Can we say something better for sparse graphs? It is shown in [4] that 
D(G) > ( 1 -o(1))5/(31nA), where the o(1) term is a function of A that goes to zero as A increases, iAmong 
the very few such lower bounds known before was that DiG ) > [n/(n -5)] [8]. This is relevant primarily 
for very dense graphs. For instance, when 1 < 5 < n/2, this bound says that D(G) > 2; however, D(G) > 
2 is readily seen to hold if (and only Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, 600-700 Mountain Avenue, Murray

its complement are dominating sets.) One of the main open questions asked in [4] is whether D(G) > (1 
- o(1))5/In A; we answer this in the affirmative, iAs a step in this direction, the problem is resolved 
in [4] for graphs with girth at least 5.) This D(G) bound is best-possible up to lower-order terms. We 
are mainly motivated by the work of [4]; as in [4], the LovAsz Local Lemma (LLL) [3] will be key to our 
analysis. The main difference is that we apply a "slow" (two-stage) partitioning that helps prune the 
dependencies in applying the LLL, leading to our improvement. The first partition is small-sized, but 
has properties much stronger than being domatic; the second partition refines the first, and crucially 
benefits from these useful properties of the first partition. THEOREM 1.1. There is a constant a > 0 
such that for any graph G with minimum degree 5 : 5(G) and maximum degree A = A(G) _> 3, D(G) _> [lnA+alnlnAJ" 
(The value o/ D(G) for A _< 2 is known via a case analysis, and there is a corresponding linear- time 
algorithm.) 2 Proof sketch for Theorem 1.1. We will assume throughout that A is large enough, i.e., for 
some constant Ao, we assume that A > A0. iIf A < Ao, Theorem 1.1 holds by setting a large enough.) Define 
[k] -~ {1, 2,..., k}, and let exp(x) denote e ~. Let N(v) denote the set of neighbors of vertex v, and 
define g+(v) = {v} U N(v); let d(v) = Ig+(v)f. Suppose 5 < In 4 A. Letting ~ = [5/(lnA + alnlnA)J, choose 
a color uniformly at random from [e], independently for each vertex. We can show via appropriate use 
of the general (asymmetric) version of the LLL (Lemma 1.1 in Chapter 5 of [1]) that with positive probability, 
all colors will be covered by N + (v) for each v. Next consider the more challenging case where 5 > ln4A. 
Let e = 1/(lnA). Define el = [e35j and e2 = [ln 2 A/(1 + b(lnlnA)/lnA)J for a suitable constant b. We 
will show the existence of a coloring X : V ~ [~1] × [g2] such that for every vertex u, there is at least 
one vertex of each color in N + iu). We apply a two-stage coloring: the first coloring determines the 
first components of the vertex-colors, and the second coloring is for the second components. Thus, the 
first coloring is a coarse partition, which the second coloring turns into a fine partition. The crucial 
role of the first coloring is to reduce certain dependencies in applying the LLL to analyze the second 
coloring. The first coloring independently colors each vertex with a random color from [gl]. By an application 
of the Chernoff bounds and the symmetric version of the LLL (Corollary 1.2 in Chapter 5 of [1]), we can 
show that with positive probability, the number of vertices in N+(u) with color c lies in the range d(u)(1 
5= 3e)/~1, for all pairs (u, c). (Note that this property is much stronger than the coloring being domatic.) 
Fix any such "good" coloring X1 : V ~ [elf. In the second coloring, choose a random color X2(U) E [e2] 
for each u, independently of all other vertices; the final color of u is the pair (Xl(U),X2(U)). Let 
Bu,c,,~2 be the bad event that there is no vertex of color (cl, c2) in N+(u). We use the asymmetric LLL 
to show that all these bad events can be avoided with positive probability. For each vertex u and each 
c E [~1], let N~c = {v C g+(u) : Xl(U) = c}. Fix an event 13~,,~,c2. We can show that Pr[B~,~i,c2] _< 
exp(-(1 -3¢) (1 + b(ln in A)/In &#38;). (ln &#38;)- d(u)/~) < (zX(ln A)b)-O-z,). Which other events 
does Bu,cl,~2 depend on? For S C_ V, let N+(S) ~ I.J.esN+(v). We can check that B~,~1,c2 only depends 
on the events in S(u, cl,c2) = {Bv,c~,~ : v c N +(N~c~) and c~ = c~}. By the general LLL, it suffices 
to display a real Y~,~,c~ E (0, 1) for each (U, el, C2), such that for all (u, Cl, 52) , Pr[Bu,cl,c=] 
< Yu,cl,c2" H (1 - yv,~i,c~). t I ( v,c l ,c2 ) ~ s ( u,c, ,c2 ) This bound can be shown via the properties 
of the first coloring by choosing Yv,ci,c~ = exp(-(1 -e) (1 - 3e). (1 + b(lnlnA)/lnA). (lnA). d(v)/6). 
A complete proof of this result appears in [5]. An interesting open problem is to obtain an algorithmic 
version of this lower bound on the domatic number. Acknowledgements. I thank Uri Feige, Magnfis Halld6rsson

be simplified to usage of the symmetric LLL by suitably preprocessing the graph. References [1] N. Alon
