 NEEDS, INTERESTS, AND REINFORCER PREFERENCES OF DATA PROCESSING PERSONNEL Theodore C. Willoughby The 
Pennsylvania State University It is a privilege to be with this group which has done some outstanding 
research work. Any reader of the proceedings of this conference has seen 75 percent of the decent reported 
research on computer personnel. Thus I consider it an honor to be asked to describe my thesis to this 
gathering. A portion of the research I am about to describe was reported earlier I and is available 
through the MISRC at the University of Minnesota. Therefore, I will describe today only those details 
of that report neces- sary to provide a setting for reporting further results. The Theory of Work Adjustment 
2 was the base upon which this research effort was designed. THE THEORY OF WORK ADJUSTMENT Proposition 
I An individual's work adjustment at any point in time is indicated by his concurrent levels of satisfactoriness 
and satisfaction. Proposition II Satisfactoriness is a function of the correspondence between an individual's 
abilities and the ability requirements of the work environment, provided that the individual's needs 
correspond with the reinforcer system of the work en- vironment. Corrollary IIa Knowledge of an individual's 
abilities and of his satisfactoriness permits the determination of the effective ability requirements 
of the work en- vironment. Corrollary IIb Knowledge of the ability requirements of the work environment 
and of an individual's satisfactoriness permits the inference of an individual's abilities. 119 Proposition 
III Satisfaction is a function of the correspondence between the rein- forcer system of the work environ- 
ment and the individual's needs, provided that the individual's abilities correspond with the abil- ity 
requirements of the work en- vironment. Corrollary IIIa Knowledge of an individual's needs and of his 
satisfaction permits the determination of the effective re- inforcer system of the work environ- ment 
for the individual. Corollary IIIb Knowledge of the reinforcer system of the work environment and of 
an individual's satisfaction permits the inference of an individual's needs. Proposition IV Satisfaction 
moderates the func- tional relationship between satis- factoriness and ability-requirement correspondence. 
 Proposition V Satisfactoriness moderates the func- tional relationship between satis- faction and need-reinforcer 
correspondence. Proposition VI The probability of an individual being forced out of the work environ- 
ment is inversely related to his satisfactoriness. Proposition VII The probability of an individual 
voluntarily leaving the work environ- ment is inversely related to his satisfaction. Combining Propositions 
VI and VII, we have: Proposition VIII Tenure is a joint function of satis- factoriness and satisfaction. 
 Given Propositions II, III and VIII, this corrollary follows: Corrollary VIIIa Tenure is a function 
of ability- requirement and need-reinforcer correspondence. Proposition IX Work personality-work environment 
 correspondence increases as a func- tion of tenure. Figure 1 The effort will ultimately have something 
to say about Proposition VIII. Current research, however, was pri- marily along the lines of Proposition 
III. The instruments chosen for the study are shown in Figure 2. QUESTIONNAIRES USED Biographic Information 
Inventory Position Information Inventory Jurgensen Job Preference Blank Strong Vocational Interest 
Blank Minnesota Importance Questionnaire Minnesota Job Description Questionnaire Minnesota Satisfaction 
Questionnaire Figure 2 Each questionnaire will be described to some extent later. The subjects were 
"professional" data processors work- ing for firms which sponsor the MISRC and enough other local Minneapolis-St. 
Paul area organizations to pro- vide better sample balance. Each subject spent about 1 3/4 hours completing 
the set of questionnaires. BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION INVENTORY Using the first of the questionnaires, 
the biographic information inventory, the characteristics of the sample were obtained. This biographic 
data was compared with the Bangs 3 sample and with the Perry and Cannon 4 sample. The Bangs sample was 
extremely well done and probably represents the best picture we have of the characteristics of the 1966 
data processing population. My sample is younger, has more women and is better 121 educated than the 
Bangs sample. Investigation has shown that probably a major cause of the differences is the larger 
size of the data processing installa- tions in my sample. This bias may not be all bad in that whatever 
use is made of the results is more likely to be made in larger installations. The sample was composed 
almost entirely of business data processors rather than scientific personnel. The larger proportion of 
women in the sample accounts for the age difference because, as usual, the women were younger than the 
men. A comparison with the Perry and Cannon sample showed an important switch in major away from mathematics 
and engineering toward business administration. A regression equation was used to estimate income. Those 
subjects substantially overestimated were given a satisfactoriness score of i; those substantially underestimated 
were given a score of 3; others were scored 2. POSITION INFORMATION INVENTORY A checklist was used 
to get information about work activities of the subjects. The responses were factor analyzed. Three factors 
were used to construct scales. The scales have a maximum intercorrelation of .33. The Hoyt internal consistency 
estimate of each of the scales is above .88. The three scales are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5. Responses 
were scored with the resulting scales. Some subjects scored high on more than one scale. A set of decision 
rules was developed which resulted in the definition of seven jobs: 1. Programmer  2. Systems Analyst 
 3. Data Processing Supervisor  4. Systems Project Leader  5. Programmer AnaLyst  6. Programmer Trainee 
 7. Miscellaneous  The numbers of subjects assigned to each job by the process is similar to the 
statistics shown by Bangs and estimates by Brandon. 5 SCALE 1 -PROGRAMMER Translate detailed flowcharts

 In 1945, the day after V-J Day, Cliff Jurgensen found his personnel office at the Minneapolis Gas Company 
crowded with applicants. No Minnesota dust bowl em- piricist could stand seeing i00 people just sitting 
there doing nothing. So Cliff jotted down some long brewing ideas, had them typed and run off on ditto. 
Soon the applicants were busy completing forms. Since that day over 50,000 people have responded to this 
 form. The preference responses on the Jurgensen are rankings of the items in Table i. Table 1 ADVANCEMENT 
 BENEFITS COMPANY CO-WORKERS HOURS SECURITY SUPERVISOR TYPE OF WORK WORKING CONDITIONS Cross 
classification of responses to the Jurgensen with bio data showed many significant results. The co-work- 
er scale was ranked higher by young, female, single, less educated, nonbusiness educated, and lower income 
subjects. Advancement was ranked higher by married men and business majors. Benefits were ranked higher 
by nonbusiness educated men. Company was ranked higher by higher income, married, business majors. Hour8 
were rated higher by low income subjects who had no profes- sional society membership. Pay was ranked 
lower by women. Security was ranked lower by the more educated. Low income subjects and women ranked 
supervisor higher. Type of work was more important to the educated. Work- ing Conditions were of more 
importance to single people. The responses differ from Jurgensen's data particularly on the company, 
security, type of work, and pay scales. This sample ranks the first two reinforcers lower and the last 
two higher. Examination of the Jurgensen Minnegasco data suggests that the current, younger, more educated 
subjects tend to respond somewhat as 125 this group. However, no Jurgensen subgroup is as ex- treme 
as this sample. The evidence is clear that young people have different values than their elders. Data 
processors appear to be comfortable among the "now" generation. The Theory of Work Adjustment predicts 
no direct re- lationship between needs and satisfaction or satis- factoriness. Comparison of rankings 
found that those people who were more satisfied ranked hours and pay lower. The more satisfactory employees 
tended to rank type of work higher but hours, benefits, and security lower than did their less satisfactory 
peers. Before leaving the Jurgensen, the diversity of re- sponses should be noted. Each reinforcer was 
ranked in each position by at least two subjects. While we can learn by examining means, we must remember 
that people are different. This means that every company policy will be dysfunctional for some employees. 
You can't please all of the people, period. STRONG VOCATIONAL INTEREST BLANK (SVIB) The SVIB was scored 
on the 84 male and 81 female keys. Let's first look at the female results. The choice reflects one of 
my biases. In ¶table 2, a selection of the means is shown. Table 2 MEAN SVIB SCALE SCORES Women by

38.79 Means by age are also shown in Table 2. Scores on the computer programmer key were substantially 
lower than those of the validation group. The means by age show some interesting patterns. The younger 
women have a more jagged profile than their elders. Male profiles on the SVIB tend to be much more jagged 
than female profiles. Thus female interest may be changing toward patterns similar to those for males. 
 The female scores on the entire scientist group were at least one standard deviation higher than those 
for women in general. The scores on the artsy-crafty type of occupations were generally about one standard 
devia- tion below those for women in general. Average on the femininity scale was 42, compared with a 
women-in- general score of 50. This femininity score is a good indicator of a switch away from the more 
traditional female pursuits. Generally the group tends to have substantial professional and scientific 
interests. The differences on the computer programmer key plus the changes which seem to be occurring 
on the profile as a whole suggest that the female SVIB computer programmer key should be reviewed. Some 
of the more interesting male responses are shown in Table 3. Table 3 MEAN SVIB SCALE SCORES Males

35.6 40.0 46.9 OIE 50.18 53.6 48.8 47.6 First, it will be noted that the mean score of 45.70 on the 
computer programmer key is significantly lower than the standard score of 50. But then look at the scores 
 by job. I expected that programmers would score higher than systems analysts or supervisors. Before 
trying to explain this strange situation, it might help to con- sider some other characteristics of 
the responses. You will note that there are several scales on which this group scored substantially 
lower than the Perry arid Cannon group used to develop the key. These are proba- bly partly accounted 
for by the differences in the demo- graphic characteristics of the two samples. On the new basic interest 
scales for the SVIB, this group scored high on the mathematics and adventure scales. The other basic 
interest scores ranged from 46.62 to 53.53 and are of little practical significance. The masculinity 
score was 59.35. Only four of the oc- cupational scales have higher masculinity scores. Couple this 
with the low female score on the femininity scale. These consistent results define one character- istic 
of the people in data processing jobs. The scales where the total score was substantially below the 
key group tend to show supervisors closer to the key group than either systems analysts or programmers. 
It will be noted that the managerial orientation key shows this tendency. There are several possible 
explanations for the discrep- ancies shown. First, the sample might be bad. The evidence described earlier 
shows some sample biases. However, the data indicates that the sample is more representative of the population 
than the Perry and Cannon sample. Second, the current supervisors may be very representa- tive of the 
group tested as programmers by Perry and Cannon. The evidence tends to support this view. Differences 
between my supervisor group and the key group are those that would be expected considering the differences 
in the demographic characteristics of the two groups. What then of my programmer group? Will they change 
in the direction of their supervisors? All the longitudi- nal evidence for the SVIB says no. Are they 
just the inexperienced who after culling for satisfactoriness and satisfaction will resemble their supervisors? 
The inexperienced were classified as trainees; Table 4 shows that satisfaction is not the answer; and 
Table 5 shows that satisfactoriness seems not to be the answer either. I must therefore conclude that 
the programmers in the current sample are really different. They re- semble neither their supervisors 
nor the SVIB key pro- grammer group. They are a psychometrically distinct group. Each of you can examine 
the data processing field of five years ago as opposed to today and find some ex- planation for the change 
which apparently has occurred. Many are apparent upon examination. The most obvious is that the BA's 
in business do not conceive of pro- gramming as an appropriate job. Table 4 MEAN SVIB SCALE SCORES

38.2 40.4 42.4 3IE 50.18 49.4 50.5 50.2 I must conclude that the present SVIB key is not ap- propriate 
for the job of computer programmer, although it may be adequate for the data processing professional. 
In any event, a new key development study should be considered. You will have noted two potentially 
useful results using the current SVIB computer programmer key. First, the managerial orientation of programmers 
and super- visors differs by one standard deviation. This suggests that supervisors' complaints about 
lack of managerial orientation of programmers may well be justified. Second, the more satisfactory employees 
scored one half a standard deviation higher on the computer programmer key. These two results suggest 
that the SVIB will be a very useful element of a selection test battery. MIQ, MJDQ, MSQ RESULTS The 
Theory of Work Adjustment in Proposition III sug- gest that, given satisfactoriness, the correspondence 
between needs and reinforcers predicts satisfaction. To test such a proposition, one needs to measure 
Needs, Reinforcers, Satisfaction, Satisfactoriness, and Correpondence. Measuring the first four is much 
easier than measuring correspondence. In this study, needs were measured using the Minnesota Importance 
Questionnaire. The MIQ has 20 needs ex- pressed in a complete paired comparison format. In addition, 
there is an absolute judgment section which serves to anchor the measurements. The Minnesota Job Description 
Questionnaire (MJDQ) has the same 20 dimensions plus a 21st-autonomy. These dimensions are arranged in 
tetrads for ranking. An absolute judgment section is added for anchoring. The Minnesota Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (MSQ) exists in long and short forms. The short form which was used in this study consists 
of the 21 items from the MIQ- MJDQ in a five-response format. The response choices are extremely satisfied, 
very satisfied, satisfied, only slightly satisfied, and not satisfied. This arrangement of responses 
gives a good spread of re- sponses over the entire scale. The satisfactoriness measure was described 
earlier. Those whose income was more under-predicted were con- sidered the more satisfactory. As was 
mentioned, correspondence measurement is a most difficult problem. Time doesn't allow for a discussion 
of the various possible alternatives. I chose to tri- chotomize the MIQ and MJDQ responses on each scale 
and calculated mean Satisfaction scores for each of the 9 cells. This method makes it possible to discover 
what- ever relationships exist for each scale. Linearity is not assumed. The mean satisfaction scores 
are shown in Tables 6-25. It will be noted that the correspondence relationship is not the same for all 
scales. For activity high need and low reinforcement correspond with lower satisfaction. This same pattern 
exists for advancement, independence, recognition, and technical supervision. A general trend for greater 
satisfaction with greater reinforcement regardless of need exists in the ability utilization, achievement, 
company policies, creativity, responsibility, social status and human relations supervision. A low need 
and low reinforcement correspond with lower satisfaction for authority and co- workers. A low need with 
more reinforcement are related to low satisfaction on the moral value and security scales. On the working 
condition scale, moderate rein- forcement with substantial need was related to low satisfaction. Nothing 
was significant on the compen- sation, social service, or variety scales, although the peculiar working 
condition pattern was somewhat evident on the variety scale. The data was examined to determine whether 
highly satis- factory subjects had a different pattern than the groups as a whole. Preliminary results 
show no such patterns. 131 Table 6 MEAN SATISFACTION SCORES Ability Utilization N E E D S HIGH

 Analysis of this and other possible moderator rela- tionships is continuing. The literature suggests 
that there is a relationship between satisfaction and turnover. If data processing management wishes 
to reduce turnover the results de- scribed suggest some direction for the effort. A work environment 
in which the ability utilization, achieve- ment, creativity, responsibility, and supervision- human relations 
reinforcement is strengthened should improve satisfaction. Organizations with a strong moral value or 
security emphasis should question the advisability of hiring people who have a low need in these dimensions. 
Organizations with low reinforcers in the areas of activity, advancement,iindependence, recognition, 
and supervision-technical should either change the reinforcement or should question bringing into data 
processing those personnel with high needs in these areas. S UMMARY There are some methodological and 
theoretical implica- tions to this research. However, let's ignore them. Instead I shall review some 
of the ways these results may be of value in managing data processing people. i. On the average data 
processing personnel have dis- tinct needs and interests. 2. Within data processing needs and interests 
vary by job.  3. There exists in the data processing community people with every interest or need pattern. 
 4. Organizations should measure their reinforcer en- vironment.  5. Organizations should measure employee 
and applicant needs.  6. The need-reinforcer correspondence relationship should be used by data processing 
management in its personnel and policy decisions.  REFERENCES i. Willoughby, T. C., ~eeds and Interests
