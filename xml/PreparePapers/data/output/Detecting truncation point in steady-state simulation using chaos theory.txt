of Industrial Engineering Hanyang University Seoul, KOREA ABSTRACT In the steady-state simulation. it 
is important to identify initialization bias for the correct estimates of the simulation model under 
study. In this paper, the methods from chaos theory are applied to the determination of truncation points 
in the simulation data for controlling the initial bias. Two methods are proposed and evaluated based 
on their effectiveness for estimating the average waiting time in M/M/1(m) queueing model. 1 INTRODUCTION 
A simulation method has been used broadly to evaluate the performance of the systcm under study, especially 
when the quantitative analysis using mathematical models is not applicable. The initial conditions of 
the stochastic simulated system may be different each time the simulation is nm. And the estimation of 
true responses in the steady-state simulation is so complicated because of the possible presence of initial 
bias. So. in studies of the steady-state characteristics of a simulation model, it is important to identi~ 
initialization bias. Many researchers have proposed the methods for determining the truncation poims(or 
warm up period) to control initial bias, but these methods seem not to work well as intended. The survey 
by Gafarian et al,( 1978) indicated that published procedures for identifying a truncation points appear 
not to exhibit very good behavior. Kclton and Law( 1984,1985) investigated the deletion effect of initialization 
bias for the three types of point estimator criteria using a particular stochastic model. Schrttben et 
al.( 1982,1983) presented a family of tests for detecting initialization bias in the mean of a simulation 
output data using a hypothesis testing framework. Cash et al. (1992) evaluated the power of a family 
of tests for Hyung-Sool Oh Dcparttncnt of Industrial Engineering Suwon Industrial College Suwon,KOREA 
initialization bias. Variations of the system observations in the transient state are large and irregular 
due to initial bias as compared to those in the steady state. In this paper. wc first propose how to 
measure the difference bctwcc!n the system variation in (he transient state and the variation in the 
steady state and then develop two methods to determine truncation points that can bc uscfd in eliminating 
initial bias of the system. We evaluate the performances of the two proposc(d methods based on their 
effectiveness in estimating the average waiting time using an M/M/l (m) queueing model. These results 
are also compared with the tncthod suggested in the literature. This paper is organized as follows. Section 
2 describes the state space reconstruction to es[irnate a dimension fcm a given time series. Section 
3 explains the Lyapunov exponent which tests the stability of dynamic systcm and the sensitive dependence 
on initial conditions. In Section 4, we discuss the simulation output analysis. Section 5 presents the 
deletion strategies to decide how much data to be deleted in simulation output data. In Section 6 we 
summarize and discuss our experimental results. Finally in Section 7 we present our conclusions and recommendations 
for fhrther work, 2 RECONSTRUCTION OF STATE SPACE Until recently, the motions of determinism and randomness 
were seen as opposites, and were studied as seperate subjects with Iittlc or no overlap. Complicatccl 
phenomena were assumed to result from complicntcd physics among the processes. Simple dynamic systems 
were assumed to produce simple phenomena, so on [y simple phenomena were modeled deterministically. Chaos 
provides a link between deterministic systems and random processes. The chaotic dynamics in a deterministic 
systcm can amplify small differences. Also. 353 354 Lee chaos implies that not all random-looking bchmior 
is the product of complicated physics, An important considcmlion in chaos theory is the dimension of 
the dynamics. ~vhich is to cslimatc (I1c fractal dimension of a hypothesized strang cattmctor . todcfillc 
tllcilsylllptotic solution of a dynamic system, in a reconstructed state space. And a dimension of the 
dynamics counts the minimum number of dcgrccs of freedom ncccssary to clcscribc this motion. Tocslimalc

~ ) } (1) where is called the embedding dimension. If a time series is deterministic and of finite dimension. 
the estimated dimension of the reconstructed attractor should convergeto the dimension of the strange 
attractor as the embedding dimension is increased. On the contrary, if a time series is random, the estimated 
dimension should be equal to the embedding dimension, The Dimension that is considered in this paper 
is expressed as follows[l] : ,+0 IV ,.0 ,=1 where 1, ly S>O H(s)= 0, if S<o { N : total number of points 
in the state space. r: length of side for small cubes. 3 LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS Suppose one has the ability 
to measure a position with accuracy Ax and a velocity with accuracy Av. Then in the position-velocity 
plane (known as the phase space) we can divide up the space into areas of size Ax*Av as shown in Figure 
1. If we are given initial conditions to the stated accuracy, we know the system is somewhere in the 
shaded box in the phase plane. But if the system is chaotic. this uncertainty grows in time to N(t) boxes 
as shown in Figure 1.b. The Size of uncertainty at time t. N(t) can be expressed as follows : N(t) z 
N(0) -e~ (3) and Oh wlcrc constant h is related to the concept of entropy in information thcon and 
will also be related 10 mother concept called thc LyapunoY exponent. The test using Lyapuno\r csponcn[ 
measures the scnsiti~i(y of the systcm to the change in the initial conditions. Conceptually. one imagines 
a small ball of initial conditions in phase space and looks al its dcformotion (a) \. (b) Figure 1: The

d(f) = 67(0).2A d(t) 2 = +log2 (4)d(0) There is a relationship between Lyapunov exponent which test 
the stability of chaotic system and cigenvalue which test the stability of dynamic system, and also a 
relationship bctwccn Lyapunov exponent which test lhc sensitive dependence on initial conditions and 
entropy which measure the growth of uncertainty. The sign of Lyapunov exponent provides a qualitative 
picture of a system s dynamics such as L >0: chaotic motion k S O : regular motion. (5)  A chaotic systcm

point estimator. The Iitcralarc on simulation methodology contains some tcchniqacs for controlling initialization 
bias as follow. These techniques arc often too elaborate and offer no assurance that initialization bias 
will be effectively controlled. Variations of the system observations in the transient state are large 
and irregular due to initial bias as compared to those in the steady state. In this research, we first 
propose how to measure the difference between the system variation in the tmnsicnt stale and the variation 
in the steady state and then develop two methods to dclcrminc truncation points that can bc used in climinatinng 
initial bias of the systcm. The equations like (7) or (8) in Table 1 measures tlic level of variations 
of the systcm observations over tinm. The level of varitions is then analyzed using the chaos theory 
to asccrlain whether or not the diffcrcncc in the varitions is significant. The chaos theory used for 
this purpose has some good features. Onc good feature is that it can classify dynamic characteristics 
of the systcm into the regular motion. the chaotic motion. and the rando]nl motion ~vitbout knowing any 
information about the input parameters. This classification process is done according to reconstruction 
state space. di mcnsion. and Lyapunov exponent that arc based on the tirnc series of the syslcm of under 
study. To test the effectiveness of equation (7) and (8). the equation are applied to given simulation 
output data in Table 1. The obtained time series data, reconstructed state space, dimension using cquntion 
(2). and Lyapunov exponent using equation (6) for two equations are al:so shown in the Table 1. As seen 
in the time series of the equation iu Tab]c 1, equation (7) dots not illustrate the systcm wrilion suftlcicntly. 
Also. since the reconstruction attractor lMS an inti nitc dimcasion and Lyapunov exponent results in 
a positive value, the variation rate evalutcd using equation (7) is under the random motion. This implies 
that equation (7) fails to distinguish the trmsicnt staIlc from the steady state. 356 Lee and Oh i -,

cerrectly using simulation output data. Two methods have been proposed to handle this problem using chaos 
theory. The suggested methods have been compared with the method by Cash et al.(1992) using M/M/l(m). 
We could find that the method M2 of which batch size is 40 among the three methods produced the best 
results with respect to P=O.5, P=0.7 and P=O.9 especially. Truncation point cannot be found in some cases. 
This means that system behavior fails to reach steady state, with the given the present run length. For 
these cases, we could natually think that the run length should be increased to get more data. Some statistical 
work is required to determine the most appropriate criteria to be used in the proposed methods. REFERENCES
