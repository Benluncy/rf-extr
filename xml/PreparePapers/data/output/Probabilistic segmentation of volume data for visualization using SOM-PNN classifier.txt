few of these classtiers produce probabilistic classtication, which is highly desirable in volume rendering 
[4]. Tradhiondly, mixture models are often used for data segmentation in volume rendering [2,4]. h these 
models, voxels are modeled as compositions of one or more materials. Different materird attributes, such 
as the light intensity and transparency, are determined by the percentages of constituent materials. 
Thus in this setting probtillistic classifiers are more desirable than rdl足or-none methods in reducing 
artifacts in rendering. Classification is given in terms of the percentage of each material from the 
original dak For each voxel in the volume data reprwented by a d dimension f-e vector x = Rd, the percentage 
of materird i in this voxel is determined by the posterior probability p(xli) p(ilx) = ~ (1)  ~p(xlk) 
k=]  where p(x] k) is the class condition probabili&#38; density of materhd k of the voxel x and K is 
the toti number of classes [4]. b practice, there are many ways to estimate the probability density fictions, 
such as parametric methods, non-parmnetric methods and semi-parametric methods [1]. The parametric approach 
assumes a spectic form of the density fiction, usually the norrnrd ditibutioq with a number of parametem 
to be op=d by fitting the model to the data seL Maximum Weriood ~) method is usually used to fid the 
optimal vducs of the parameters. For an image pixel represented by d dimension feature vector x = Rd,

{p, X} , where P is the d dimension mean vector and x is the dxd covariance mati The parameters are estimated

The E~ectation-h~on @h~ method is an e=ple of the semi-pammetric method [1]. However, for -h class, in

in advance. This raises another problem which has to be solved exTetienM1y. h this paper, we propose 
a hybrid classfier, the SOM-P~ classfier in which the densi~ function is ~ simply by the com~mation of 
the se~-oreg map (SOW [9] and the probtil~ic ned network ~~ [11,12]. The SOM map is trained with a tminiig 
set W The Pm algorithm is then tied out based on the SOM map traind k addition to the gened form of density

as fo~ows. Swtion 2 gives the backgound of mtitisde image structure and wavelet tiorrn. Section 3 presents 
the Pm, SOhI rdgorhhms and our new SOM-P~ classfier. fiTerimentation redts and conclusions are given 
in Sections 4 and 5 respecti~rely. 2 MULTISCALE IMAGE FEATURE VECTOR ~RACTION USING WAVELET TWNSFORM 
 It hos been shown that the ody operator fkrnily s-g the nti front-end *ion constraints of ~meari~, s~ 
varianw, rotation vtianc% and sde invariance is the bsian and W its pardd derivatives [~. This operator 
Wy provides a complete representation of image structure. For tw-ensiond hnage% the five irreducible 
invariant of up to second order derivatives can be represented using tensor notations {L, L,L,, L , L,LOLJ,L,LJJ 
(5) where L is the image intensity, L&#38;j the squared norm of the gradieng and L,, the Laplacian of 
the image. It has been shown that the segmentation of intensiv images can be done using ody the zero 
and fist derivatives of tie Gaussi~ wtie the second order derivatives are useti when d~g with te= images 
[q. 72 The nmnerid dculation of these elements can be performed with the type of wavelet transform described 
by Mdlat [10] when the Gaussian is used as the smoothiig function in the wavelet transfom For each pkel 
in the irn@e, our feature vector is then formed by 9 components: the original intensity value, the smoothed 
intensiv value and the gradient magnitude of the smoothed images from scale 1 to scale 4 by following 
Wls idea Let be the ddation of tbe smoothiig function O(x,y) at sdes. The two wavelet fictions are de(x,y) 
 y (x,y) = ~ m(x,y) y (x,y) = (? @ The dilations of tie wavelet functions at sties are (8) The wavelet 
transform of the image, ~(x,y), at scales has two components w,lf(x,y) = f * y: (X,y) W= f(X,y) = f * 
y:(x,y) (9) Sinw = SVU* ~.)(x,Y) > (lo) tie image @lent magnitude at sdes is [~ f (X,y)lz +Iyzf (X,y)tz 
(11) Hence, for each pkel in the image, its smoothed intensity value and the gradient magnitude of the 
image smoothed at each scrde are obtained dwecfly from the discrete wavelet transform. 3 PNN, SOM ALGORITHMS 
AND THE NEW SOM-PNN CLASSIFIER 3.1 The PNN Algorithm The probtilfistic neti networh or Pm, is originated 
from P-n s probtilli~ density estimator [11,12]. For a given data set X+{xl,~,...,xN}, theParzendensity

performance score of the Pm classfier with a given G is determined by the cross-vflldation method h the 
process of cross-vrdidatio% each -g smple is tempotiy removed from tie training set and used as the test 
sample. The remaining training data is then used in the Pm classfier to clnssify tis test sample. H the 
sample is corrdy class-tied the performance score is increased by 1. Repeat this procedure ford tie -g 
-Ies go give the find score. FinMy, a one dimension heuristi~y search is petiormed to fid the optimal 
c with the lnrgest performance score.  3.2 The SOM Algoritim me ~dard Kohonen map [9] is a useti tool 
for clustering topologicrdly or-g and subspace mapping h most cases, the topology of the SOhfisa two

above uses dl the samples in the timg set to ehate the probability density fictions and perform classification 
k image segmentatio~ a -g set often comprises a large number of samples and the evaluation of a new sample 
is very slow for such a large training set On the other han~ data in the training set is not noise free 
and if the tradition~ Pm dgorhhrn is used don% the classtication may be *-wted by the noise. We propose 
a SOM-PN classfier to overcome the ~cdties of the tradition Pm dgonti b the SOh4-P~ classifier, reference 
vectors from each class of the trained SOM map, instead of the originrd training samples of a large she, 
are used to estimate the probtillig density function. Suppose that the tied SOM map has Nk nodes for 
materhd with label k and the ,, b corresponding reference vectors are m}, i=1,2, .... N1, the probtilfity 
density fiction ofmaterid k is then estimated by (16) Having obtained the estimated probability density 
of each material, the probabilistic classification are obtained using formula (l). Our hybrid approach 
as described in tils section has the following advantages. F-through the use of SOM, the Pm algorithm 
is relaed of the burden of having to proms a large S* training se~ Secon&#38; since the trained SOM map 
serves as a good representative of the training samples, its use makes the Pm classfier more robust M 
the presence of noise data in the original trainiig set Ftiemore, the probabilistic classification, which 
is highly d~irable for visudimtion but cannot be obtained with SOM rdone, is achieved naturally in Pm. 
Finrdly, the wmbination of SOM and Pm determines the number of basis functions in the model automatically 
and simplifies the process of probability density estimation as compared with the EM method [1]. The 
procedures of our rdgorithm me shown in Fig. 1. Step 1: SOM trainiig trainiig set SOM map Step 2 Pm

The proposed SOM-P~ classfier has been built for classing both CT sloth volume data and W human brain 
volume dak For dtierent kinds of volume daw we apply different strategies in choosing the f=ture vectors 
to achieve the best segmentations. Compared to the brain volumes, the ~ sloth data is less complicated 
anatomicrdly. The intensity contrast of image pkels in ~ sloth data is dso higher than that in MR brain 
volumes. Moreover, the phenomena of intensiv inhomogeneities in ~ data are much less apparent than in 
MR dam To achieve fast ad accurate segmentations, for each pkel, we use only the originrd intensity value 
and its gradient magnitude at scale 1 to form the !足 f-e vector. Adding more components into the ftiture 
vector in this case would not improve the performacc of the classifier, and 4 t would m&#38;e the algorithm 
less efficient However, for the I segmentation of more complicated MR brain data to be addressed , -. 
 in the second subsection, we will have to use the complete 9 components f~ture vector for each pkel 
as described in Section 2 to get better results. I  _____ . .._  _. -. ~.,, ,- ..,,. 4.1 Sloti CT

which accords with level of a p~~el in tie classfied images is the avemgd vrdue of the very low correct 
rate of test set 2 with the SOM classifier. For * four matends with classified probabilities.the three 
data sets, the SOM-P~ classifier outperforms the PNN classfier due to the clustering abifity of SOM. 
Ml the 128 slice images are classified by the above classifiers. The classified images are stacked together 
to yield a 3D probtilhstic classification. On an SGI hdigo2 Maximum ~A~ wor~tion with 195W RIOOOOCPU 
and 192Mb memory, the time used to perform the classification of the whole 3D ~ sloth data using the 
SOM-PNN, ~, PNN and SOM clmstiers are 241s, 178s, 48524s and 159s, respectively. The um SOM-PNN classifier 
is about 200 times faster than the PNN (a) (c)  classtier. The signticant improvement in efficiency 
makes the proposed SOM-PNN classifier a favorable choice in time-critid applications, where non-parametric 
methods would be too slow to be used. Moreover, the time that Pm classifier takes varies with ~erent 
trainiig sets, while the time used by the SOM-PNN classfier is ahnost the same. The training time of 
the SOM used in the SOM-PNN classifier is 734s while that of the PNN with the full training set is more 
than 20 hours on the same machme. R A direct volume rendering method based on 3D texture(d) (e) mapping

the oti.gind training set retits a segmentation stim to tie one obtained Tvith the SOhI-P~ classifier. 
h Fig. 7 (d), the h~ clustier produces good segmentation in the upper part of the brain but CSF ficts

of tie brain p~~el intensity, the ~vhite matter in tie lo~verpti of tie bmin is under-segmented compared 
~viththe SOhl-P~ class~ed segmentation &#38; seen in Fig 7 (~, the ~vhitematter in the lo~verpti of the

The time used to segment this volume \vith the SOhf-P~, SO~ ~ and Pm classtier is 158s, 134s, 63s and 
14470s respectively. Again significant improvement of efficiency is achieved Ivith the SOM-P~ classifier 
compared tith the original Pm algorithm. The classified volumes are rendered ~vith textie mapping hard~vare. 
h Fig. 8, the five rendered volumes are cfipped corondly \viti the same vie~vpointmd clipping depth. 
k these images, the colors assigned to gray matter, \vhite matter and CSF are r~ ~vhite and ~een respectively. 
From visual inspection the SOM-P~ classifier, the Pm classifier and the h~ classtier yield similar segmentations 
of gray matter and \vhite matter in the upper pti of the brain. The ~ clmsifier over足segments the CSF 
\vhich leads to the noise in the boundary area of the brain. k the Io\ver part of the brain, due to the 
etistence of intensity inhomogeneities, most of the \vhite matter is lost in the SOM segmentation. For 
the other 3 methods, i.e., the ~, Pm, and SOM-P~, the segmentations obtained \vith the SOM-P~ classifier 
are closest to the manual segmentation. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)  fig. 7. The original bwin scan (a), its 
manual segmentation (b), the segmentations with the SOM-PNN(c), ML(d), PNN(e) and SOM (9 classifier respectively. 
For dflerent segmentations, in addition to the visual inspection, nmnerid metrics are needed to compare 
them quantitatively. b tie literature, there are bvo metics often used to compare the similarity behveen 
segmentations. One is tie overlap metric [ln and the other is the percentage of dtierence [15]. For a 
given 75 . . --足 +:.:. . . ____ .-.-__.. -,.,<,.. ____ voxel class assignrnen~ the overlap metric between 
two se~entations is defied as the number of voxek that have this cl= assignment in boti segmentations 
divided by the number of voxels where either of the two segmentations has this class assignment [In. 
~ metric approaches 1.0 for retits that are very stiar and is near 0.0 when they share no stiarly classfied 
voxek. The percentage of ~erence between two segmentations is defined as tie ratio between the number 
of ~erenfly labeled pixeh Mithin the region of interest @O~ and the toti number of pixels ivithin the 
ROI [lq. The percentage of ~erence measures tie sirnilarig between two segmentations in the ROI #obdy 
w~e the Overlap m-es each classes separately. Nthough these two metrics yield a reasonable comparison 
between two se~entatiow they are not appropriate for comparing probabiic segmentations because pixel 
aunting does not accommodate prob&#38;iEties associti with probabiidy classtied voxek However, since 
in the Eterature, many segrnentadons are ody compared with manti segmentatio~ in pardctiar the orerlap 
metric in the ae of the 20 h~ brain volumes we will dso use this metric to compare our results. To evaluate 
a probabi~c segmentation with the overlap metic, the prob~l~ic re~ts must ~ be mnverted into non足prob~l~ic 
ones. To this en~ probabiistidly classified voxek are labeled as the class with the largest probability. 
As with the case 112_2, the other 19 h~ brain volumes are classfied and tested in the same way. The over~ap 
values of CSF, gray matter and white matter are averaged over these 20 normal wes. Table 2 is there-tits 
and the comparison witi other methods reported in ~SR ~lm. The gray matter overlap metric of ~erent methods

with the manti se~entadon than tie other seven methods. For gray matter, the SOM and SOhf-P~ classfier 
are at 1-13% higher than other methods. The most si@mt improvement is the CSF segmentation. The CSF overlap 
of dl methods in ES~ with rqect to the manual segmentatio~ is below 0.1. The CSF overlap of our implementation 
of ~ is only 0.13. However, the CSF overlap of the SOM-P~ classfier with manual se~entation and that 
of the SOM classifiers have achieved 0.3S9 and 0.419 respectively. Besides, as seen in Fig. 9, the performance 
of tie SOM and SOM-P~ classfier varim much less si@candy than other methods, thus consistent classification 
has been achieved for these 20 nonnd MR brain volumes. It is not smprising that the SOM classifier yields 
better numerid resdts than the SOM-P~ classifier with the overlap metric because truncation on the probabilistic 
classification ofiets the accuracy of the SOM-P~ classtier. Since there is a considerable loss of classified 
information when mnverting probabilistic segmentation into a non足probabilistic segmentatio~ to get a 
more reasonable comparison between the SOM-P~ classifier md the SOM classfier, we now propose a generrdked 
difference ratio metric. For pixel n, let the probabilities of segmentation A be PnA= {Pn~,Pn~,..-, P;} 
and that of segmentation B be ~ ={~~, Pn~,..., P~} , the genedied dtierence ratio between A and B is 
defined as (19) where N is the totrd number of voxels in the ROI and K is the number of materials to 
be segmented. Here the ROI is the brain volume without air and K= 3. h the non-probabilistic we, the 
genedtid dtierence ratio is reduced to the percentage of dfierence be~een *O se~entation used in [15]. 
The dfierence ratios of automatic segmentations and the manual segmentation for the 20 norrnrd brain 
volumes are listed in Table 3. Three automatic segmentations, SOM-P~, SO~ and ~, are compared altogether.

a be seen that the avcragd difference ratio of tie SOM-PNN clmsfier is 1.6~% lower than that of the SOM 
cl=~er. Compared with ML metho~ the SOM-PNN classifier has a 5.S96 lower difference ratio. hforeover, 
this refit is quite promising because in [15], the avemgd ~erenm ratio is about 20Yq though ditTerentdata

other automatic classifiers mentioned above. From 2D and 3D inspection it produ= the closest images to

statistid classtiers with the o~rerlapmetric. According to tie genedid ~erence ratio metic, it is *O 
better than the SOM classfier. Compard with the tradition PNN dgoriti the SOM-PNN classifier achieves 
si@cant improvement in eticiency and the classification accuracy is dso irnprovd 5 CONCLUS1ONS N e have 
proposed a new probabiiic classfier, the SOhf-PNN class-tier. for medicrd data classification and volume 
rendering. The new classfier is a serni-pmetric density esdmator and produces probtil~istic classification 
with the Bayesim cofidence masure. The volumes segmented using the SOM-PNN classfier reverd anatomidly 
more meaningful structures than non足probtilfisdc segrnentatiom Nnrneridly, the SOhl-PNN classtier is 
more accurate than other automatic se~entation methods in both the sloth and the brain ens= me SOhI-PNN 
clwfier is dso a M classfier. Based on the noise-free representative reference vectors providti by SOhL 
tie SOhI-PNN classfier segmens the sloti CT data 200 ties -r than the originrd PNN algorithm. Essentially, 
tie SOhI-PNN classfier is an intensity based cl-er and wi~ lose its power when the inter-and intra-scan 
intenshy inhomogeneities present severe problems. However, with the modem h~ sue~ this problem has been 
- d as inditied by tie low ~erence ratios for the last seved cases in tie 20 normrd brain data sets. 
h another aspecc the SOh~-P~ clmsifier needs the semi-automatic segmentation of seved brain scans -ad 
the pre-training of the SOhi map as prepro=s-mg steps. By our exTefien&#38;, segmentation of 2 or 3 scans 
does not present as a big bnrdq and tie pre-tig of the SOhI in the SOhI-P~ classtier can be done in a 
matter of minutes. The problem of quantitatively evdnating probabiiidy segmentation is raisd in this 
paper. The metrics cmrentiy used in fite-e are suitable for non-probtil~ic segmentation and are not appropriate 
for evrduatiag the qufllty of segmentation for volume rendering. For e=ple, although the SOM classifier 
Ao produ= high overlaps with mand segrnentatiow tie volumes se~ented with tie SOhI classifier lose more 
detaik than probtiiicrdly segmented volumes. h this paper, a gene~ed ditimence mtio is proposed in order 
to conduct reasonable comparison among probtilfistic classtien without sacrificing the probtil~ic propm.
