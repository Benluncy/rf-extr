The complicated coordinate transformations in general relativity make coordinate invariant classi-fication 
schemes extremely important. A computer program, written in SHEEP, performing an algorithmic classification 
of the curvature tensor and a number of its derivatives is presented. The output is a complete description 
of the geometry. The problem to decide whether or not two solutions of Einstein's equations describe 
the same gravitational field can be solved if the (non-) existence of a solution to a set of algebraic 
equations can be established, The classification procedure has been carried through for a number of fields, 
and solutions previously believed to describe physically different situations have been shown to be equivalent. 
We exemplify with a physically interesting class of geometries. PHYSICAL BACKGROUND General relativity 
describes gravity gee-metrically, as curvature of space-time. The funda-mental object is the metric g~v 
(x p) which gives the distance ds between arbitrary neighbourin8 points with coordinates x ~ and x D 
+ dx ~ ds2 = g#V (x p)dx ~ dx v The gravitational field is thus describedby the functions g~V (xP).

ACM O-89791-047-8/81-0800-0079 $00.75 The theory is invarlant u~der arbitrary (reasonably regular) coordinate 
transformations. There are no preferred coordinate systems, any continuous numbering of the points in 
space-time is allowed. The form of the metric, however, is highly dependent on the choice of coordinate 
system. The complexity of the coordinate transformations makes this a serious problem. It is difficult 
to interpret the metric: true ly physical effects are confused with effects introduced by the special 
choice of coordinates. In particular, it is non-trivial to decide whether or not two metrics g#V(X p) 
and ~#F(~ D) describe the same gravitational field (i.e. if there is a coordinate transformation ~ (xF) 
transforming g~ into g#y ). This is the so called equivalence problem. These problems are of fundamental 
origin since they are a result of the invariances of the theory. To illustrate the situation we look 
at a simple two-dimensional example: a sphere with two different coordinate systems. ds 2 = de 2 + sin20

Hp is the isotropy supgroup (see [1] or [3]). Two metrics gU P (x p) and 8~u(xxP) are equivalent if and 
only if the algebraic equations @(x) = ~('x'), D@(x) = D~(~) ..... Dk~(x) = = Dk~x) (where Dk~ stands 
for the symmetrized components of the k:th covariant derivative of the Weyl spinet) have a solution~ 
~= ~(xV). It is a non-algorithmic procedure to decide this. In those cases we have considered so far 
it has been possible to establish (non-)equivalence. THE COMPUTER PROGRAM A computer program carrying 
out the classification procedure has been developed by one of us (J.E.~.) [7,9,10]. At present only the 
vacuum case is completed but the generalization to non-vacuum solutions is under consideration. The program 
is written in the algebraic language SHEEP [11] (which at present runs on a PDP-10, but will soon be 
available on other computers as well) with a number of additions, some of them discussed below. Among 
currently available languages SHEEP seems to be the most suitable for the following reasons: - It is 
fast, 10-20 times faster than REDUCE for this kind of calculations. - It is interactive,  It prints 
formulae in a nice multiple line format and it is easy to instruct SHEEP how to write a new identifier 
in such a format. The original language SHEEP does, however, have some limitations which have been handled 
by a number of additions. These additions are written in Standard LISP, using functions special for SHEEP. 
One extension allows SHEEP to use complex quantities and coordinates exploiting relations as f*,z = (f'z 
*)~' where means complex conjugation and comma partial differentiation. The sphere mentioned above can 
be described in complex coordinates z and Z aS: ds 2 = dz dz* (I + ~_)2 Although a metric in general 
relativity can always be written in a real form a complex form may be more suitable and is often used. 
One of the important advantages of SHEEP is its handling of tensors. However, for our purposes we need 
to calculate components of spinets rather than tensors. This made an extensive addition to SHEEP necessary. 
As an example consider ~ab' " Here ~ is a coordinate index taking the values 0, 1, 2 and 3 while the 
spinet indices a and b* take values 0 and 1 only. Furthermore it has an hermitean symmetry =~uba**r- 
for real coordinates. When the component ~3i0 v is requested during a calculation the ~30tl component 
is picked up and complex conjugated. This mechanism resembles the way SHEEP handles antisymmetric tensors. 
The savings achieved by the use of spinors and in particular symmetrized spinets rather than tensors 
are crucial. If we have a worst case (we doubt it exists) the 7:th covariant derivative of the curvature 
tensor R~kl;m;n;p;q;r;s; u has to be calculated. This object has 86016 real components, related by Bianchi 
identities which are technically complicated to make use of. Calculation of that many algebraic expressions 
seems almost unreallstic. When using symmetrized parts of eovariant derivatives the number of components 
we have to calculate in order to obtain the 7:th covariant derivative of the spinors ~, ~ and A will 
only be 187, 169 of them beeing complex. One of the subproblems mentioned above is the determination 
of the number of functionelly independent functions by calculating the rank of the 81 An Algorithmic 
Classification of Geometries in General Relativity Jacobian (the functional determinant). The functions 
to be considered are the real and imaginary parts of , ~, A and their covariant derivatives. These functions 
are studied successively to see if they are functionally independent of the previously tested functions. 
(There are at most four independent functions since this is the dimension of space-time.) Suppose we 
have k functionally independent functions: fl, f2 .... fk. A new function g is independent of theese 
if, for k=O : g'k ~ 0 3 k=i : 2 ~ ¢lmkPft,kg, p~0 ks0 p=0 k<p 3 ks2 : 2 ~ ~ elmkpfi, k ~0 m=O ks0 g' 
m p=0 k<p and analogously for ks3. When a new independent function is found the result is stored as 
the vector $1 k , the antisymmetric tensor j2lmor the vector 33 k respectively. AN EXAMPLE We illustrate 
our method by classifying the Kerr-NUT geometry. This includes the Kerr rotating black hole (I=0), the

function is found in the second covariant derivative. Since the continuous transformation freedom of 
the dyad is not reduced (the dyad is completely determined already by D~) the algorithmic classification 
stops here. RESULTS When classifying a number of the Harrison metrics we found that three of these earlier 
belived to be distinct [5] are in fact equivalent, i.e. there exist coordinate transformations between 
them [7]. The vacuum Petrov type D solutions are all known [12] and include many of the physically most 
important solutions. We have now classified all of them, except one, and hope to complete this work in 
the near future [13]. It is a pleasure to thank Professor Bertel Laurent and Dr. Inge Frick for numerous 
fruitful discussions. REFERENCES 1. E. Caftan, "Lecons sur la Geometrle des Espaces de Riemann" (Gauthier-Villars,
