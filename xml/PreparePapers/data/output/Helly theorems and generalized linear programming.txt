 Helly Theorems and Generalized Linear Programming Nina Amenta * Abstract Recent combhatorial algorithms 
for linear programming also solve certain non-linear problems. We call these Gener­alized Linear Programming, 
or GLP, problems. One way in which convexity has been generalized by mathematicians is through a collection 
of results called the Helly theorems. We show that the every GLP problem implies a Helly theorem, and 
we give two paradigms for constructing a GLP problem from a Helly theorem. We give many applications, 
includlng linear expected time algorithms for finding line transversals and hyperplane fitting in convex 
metrics. These include GLP problems with the surprising property that the constraints are non-convex 
or even disconnected. We show that some Helly theorems cannot be turned into GLP problems. 1 Introduction 
 It haa frequently been noted that recent linear pro­gramming algorithms can be applied to various non­linear 
problems as well. The randomized expected linear time algorithms for fixed dimensional problems of [C90], 
[S90] were applied to specific examples, including con­vex programming. The deterministic fixed dimensional 
algorithms of [D84] and [M83] were generalized to spe­cific non-linear problems with rather more effort 
[D92], [M89]. A major advance waa the sub-exponential algo­rithm of [MSW92]. They defined an abstract 
framework defining the combinatorial structure of a problem solved by their algorithm, and showed a number 
of non-linear problems which it solved. This same abstract frame­work applies to [C90] as well, which, 
with an additional assumption, can be derandomized to give deterministic linear time algorithms for fixed 
dimensional problems [CM93]. We may begin to wonder, then, what is the re­lationship of this abstract 
framework to the vast body of previous work in combinatorial geometry and math­ematical programming?

characterization of easy non-linear problems, such aa convex programming? We will call the class of problems 
described by the abstract framework General­ized Linear Programming, or GLP, problems. In this paper 
we forge a connection to one relevant area of combinatorial geometry, the class of results know as Helly 
theorems. The archetype is Helly s Theorem Let K be a family of at least d + 1 convex sets in Ed, and 
assume K is jinite or that every member of K is compact. Then if evey d + 1 members of K have a point 
in common, there is a point common to all the members of K. This is one of the fundamental properties 
of convexity. There are many similar theorems with the same logical structure, for objects other than 
convex sets, for proper­ties other than intersection, or for special caaes in which d + 1 is replaced 
by some other constant k. These are generically called Helly theorems. Combinatorial ge­ometers collect 
Hell y theorems, in much the same way that computer scientists collect NP-complete problems [DGK63], 
[GPW93], [E93]. The algorithmic implications of Helly theorems has been a question of some interest. 
For Helly s theorem itself, an algorithm given by [AH91] finds a point in the intersection of n convex 
sets, if one exists, with O(nd+l ) calls to a subroutine which finds some point in the intersection of 
d + 1 convex sets. The GLP algorithms find the minimum point in the intersection, with respect to some 
convex objective function (this is the convex programming problem), using only expected O(n) calls to 
a stronger subroutine which also finds the minimum. To apply GLP in an analogous way to other Helly theorems, 
we need to come up with an objective function. Section 2 formally defines these notions. In section 3 
we begin by showing that there is a Helly theorem about the constraint family of every fixed dimensional 
GLP problem; that is, the class of problems for which there are Helly theorems includes the fixed dimensional 
GLP problems. We can use this to produce new Helly theorems from known GLP problems. For example, we 
state a Helly theorem for line transversals of boxes in E3. In the following sections, we give two paradigms 
for constructing a GLP objective function for a family of constraints which has a Helly theorem, using 
some additional geometric assumptions about the constraints. We use these paradigms to show that the 
following are fixed dimensional GLP problems, giving expected linear time algorithms: 1. Finding a line 
transversal of translates of a convex (but possibly complicated) object in the plane, 2. Finding a line 
transversal in Ed for some special classes of objects, 3. Finding the closest hyperplane to a family 
of points under the weighted LW metn c, in which every coefficient of every point is equipped with a 
weight, 4. Finding the closest line to a family of points under the weighted Lw metric, 5. Finding 
the closest hyperplane to a family of points under a convex polygonal metric, 6. Finding, for a convex 
object C of constant complex­it y and a family K of convex objects of constant complexity, the largest 
homothet of C contained in the intersection of K, or the smallest homothet of C cent aining K, or the 
smallest homothet of C intersecting every member of K, 7. Finding a point in the intersection of a family 
of sets, each of which is the union of two convex sets, given that the intersection never has more than 
two connected components.  In the first paradigm, we introduce a scale parameter into the constraints, 
and use this parameter as the ob­jective function. For instance, to find a line transversal for a family 
of translates we scale them down to points, and then gradually grow them until we can fit a line through 
them. In section 5 we show that this paradigm is also useful for formulating certain non-linear opti­mization 
problems as GLP. In the second paradigm, we use a nested family of constraints as an objective function. 
Our examples include problems in which the constraints are non-convex and even disconnected; this shows 
that the class of GLP problems strictly contains the class of convex programming problems. Finally, in 
section 7, we show that some additional geometric assumption on the structure of the constraint family 
is necessary, by exhibiting a set system with a Helly theorem which does not become a fixed dimen­sional 
GLP problem under any objective function. Besides the applications presented here, we expect this work 
will be useful in identifying and solving new GLP problems, It is often difficult and sometimes impossible 
to reduce a GLP problem to linear or convex form; these results give some alternative approaches to getting 
an efficient algorithm. In addition, it makes it easier to implement programs for these problems, since 
a single implementation of a GLP algorithm can be equipped with specialized subroutines to solve any 
one of them.  2 Definitions Let C be a family of objects, and P a predicate on subsets of C. A Helly-type 
theorem for the pair (C, T) is something of the form: There is a constant k such that for all finite 
H ~ C, H has property P if and only if every B ~ H with IBI ~ k has property P The constant k is called 
the Helly number of (H, P). Helly s theorem proper is that convex sets in Rd have Helly number d + 1 
with respect to the intersection property, but there are many other sets systems which have Helly theorems 
[DGK63]. We call a pair (C, P) a Helly system if it has a Helly theorem. Now we review the abstract framework 
for general­ized linear programming from [MS W92]. A generalized linear programming (or GLP) problem 
is a family H of constraints and an objective function w from subfami­lies of H to some totally ordered 
set S. The pair (H, w) must obey the following conditions: 1. Monotonicity: For all F ~ G ~ H: w(F) ~ 
w(G)  2. Locality: For all F ~ G ~ H such that w(F) = w(G) and for each h c H: w(F +h)>w(F) ifandonly 
ifw(G +h)>w(G)   The set S must contain a special maximal element Q; for G ~ H, if w(G) = fl, we say 
G is infeasible; other­wise we call G feasible. A basis for G ~ H is a minimal subfamily B ~ G such that 
w(B) = w(G). Here min­imal is to be taken in the sense that for every h ~ B, w(B h) < w(B). The combinatorial 
dimension d of a GLP problem is the maximum size of any basis for any fessible subfamily G; an infeasible 
subfamily G may have a basis of size d + 1. A GLP problem is fized di­mensional if d is constant. A GLP 
algorithm takes a GLP problem (H, w) and returns a basis B for H. Matou5ek, Sharir and Welzl [MSW92] 
give a randomized GLP algorithm which uses two primitive operations. A basis computation takes a family 
G of at most d + 1 constraints and finds a bssis for G. A violation test takes a basis B and a constraint 
h, and returns true if B is a basis of B + h. Let tvbe the time required for a violation test and tb 
be the time required for a basis computation. Their algorithm runs in expected time linear in n and subexponential 
in d, assuming that both tV and tb are polynomial in d. In our applications, d will always be a constant 
much smaller than n. With the dependence on d hidden in the big-Oh notation, the algorithm takes expected 
O(t n + t~ lg n) time. Thus to get an algorithm which runs in expected linear time, to must be O(1), 
although we can afford to spend up to O(n/ lgn) time per basis computation. 3 Helly Theorems from GLP 
Problems We begin by showing that there is a Helly theorem about the constraint family of every GLP problem. 
Theorem 3.1 Let (H, w) be a GLP problem with com­ binatorial dimension k. H has the property w(H) s m 
if and only if every BGH with IBI ~k+ 1has theproperty w(B) ~m Proofi Let w(H) ~ m. By the monotonicity 
condition, every B ~ H must have w(B) ~ w(H) ~ m. Going in the other direction, H must contain some basis 
B with w(B) = w(H), with IBl < k + 1. So if every B with IBI ~ k+ 1haa w(B) g m, then w(H) = w(B) ~ m. 
c1 It is interesting that this proof does not use the locality condition of the abstract GLP framework. 
Notice that when m is the special symbol 0, this means that every infeasible family of constraints contains 
an infeasible family of size < k + 1. We can use this theorem to prove new Helly theorems. Application 
3.1 Line transversal of boxes in E3. A line transversal of a family of objects is a line which intersects 
every object. Let a positive line transversal be one directed into the positive orthant of Ed. The argument 
in [A92] implies that finding a positive line transversal of a family of axis-aligned boxes in E3 is 
a GLP problem with combinatorial dimension 4. This gives the following Helly theorem: there is a positive 
line transversal of a family of axis-aligned boxes in E3 if and only if there is a positive line transversal 
for every subfamily B of boxes such that IB [ ~ 51 We can also show that certain problems are not GLP 
using Theorem 3.1. This is useful in the same way as a lower bound, in that it rules out a particular 
line of attack. Application 3.2 Line transversal of convex sets in E3. In [AGPWl, they give an example 
of a linearly ordered family A of n disjoint convex compact sets in E3 which has no line transversal, 
although every n-2-element sub­family of A has a line transversal consistent with the 1Nimod Me~idd~ 
hm since reduced this problem to line= programnu rig, but the Helly theorem follows from the fact that 
it is GLP. ordering. This tells us that we cannot hope to apply GLP in this situation, even given a 
linear ordering. 4 First Paradigm Now we turn to the question of constructing a GLP problem, for a Helly 
system (C,?), to determine, for any H G C, whether H has property P. We begin by assuming a rather general 
geometric context. Let X be a set, and C a family of subsets of X. For G~C, wewrite nGfor{z EXlz E h, 
Vh~G}. Let n, with no argument, be the property that (1 G # 0. We say that a family of sets which has 
property n intersects. Assume that (C, n) is a Helly system, with some fixed Helly number k. We say that 
(C, n) is embedded in X. For any H &#38; C, we will construct an algorithm which determines whether H 
has property fl by actually exhibiting some m E X such that m c fl H, if one exists. There are many geometric 
Helly theorems that fall into this context. For instance the theorem in application 3.1 can be restated: 
Let A be the family of all axis-aligned boxes in E3, and for any a c A, let c(a) be the set of positive 
lines which intersect a. Let C be the family {c(a) I a c A}. Then the system (C, n) has Helly number 
5. We can define an objective function on subfamilies G ~ H using some well-behaved ordering on the points 
z c X, just ss we do in linear programming. Recall that S is some totally ordered set. Observation 4.1 
Let C be a family of subsets of X, and let w : .X -S be any function such that w(G) = min{w (m) I m E 
(l G} exists for any G ~ H with flG # 0. Define w(G) = Q when f)G = 0. Then w satisfies the monotonicity 
condition of the abstract GLP framework. It is also true that if the function WI has a unique value on 
every element of z, then (H, w) also obeys the localit y condition. However, such an (H, w) will not 
necessarily have bases of fixed size. We now define some additional structure on a Helly system which 
produces a natural objective function w. Let Z be an interval on the real line 7?. Define a nested family 
~ to be {h~ I~ c Z}, where h~ C X for each A, and hi C hj for i < j. NOW consider a collection ~ of nested 
families ~, all indexed by the same parameter ~. For ~ ~ ~, we write GA as shorthand for {h~ : ~ G ~}. 
For a fixed value of A, we say that ~ intersects at J if fl GA # 0. If ~ haa the property that (HA, n) 
is a~elly system of dimension k, for every A, we say that (H, n) is a parametrized Helly system with 
Helly number k. Notice that if ~ ~ ~ does not intersect at some value ~z, then ~ also fails to intersect 
at all Al < ~2, and if ~ ~ ~ intersects at Al, then ~ also intersects at all A2>A~. A parameterized 
Helly system haa a natural objec­tive function w. For ~ ~ ~, let w(~ be the minimum value A* such that 
G intersects at J*, or $2 if @ doea not intersect at any value of J. The only remaining difficulty is 
that (1 GA. might consist of more than one point, which is insufficient to establish the locality con­ 
dition. In the event, however, that (1 GA. consists of a unique point for every ~ ~ ~, we get a GLP problem 
of dimension k. Theorem 4.1 If (~, n) is a parametrized Helly sys­tem with Helly number k such that, 
for all ~ ~ ~, 1. 1 = w(G) ezists, and  2. lnG~.1=1 when A*#Q  then (~, w) is a GLP problem of combinatom 
al dimen­ sion k. Proof: We can interpret the elements of ~ ss subsets ofthe spaceZxX, sothat apoint 
(i,Z) EZ xX is in ~ if z E hi. Observe that the x are closed subsets of Z x X, and the projection into 
Z is a function w on the points of Z x X. Since we assume that 1* = w(G) always exists, observation 4.1 
tells us that the problem (H, w) obeys the monotonicity condition. We also assume that for any ~ G ~, 
(1 GA. consists of a single point m G X. (~, w) therefore also obeys the locality condition, since for 
~_~ ~ wit~ w(~ = w(~ and any additional constraint h, w(~ + h) > w(~ only when m @~, so that w(7 + ~) 
> w(~) as well. To prove that (H, w) has combinatorial dimension k, we have to show that the size of 
any basis is ~ k. Con­sider any ~ ~ ~ and a basis ~ for ~. The definition of a basis says that for any 
~ c ~, w(3 ~) < w~). Let ~maz = rnaz{w(~ ~) I T c ~. The basis ~ does not intersect at Jmoz, but for 
any ~ E ~, w(B ~) s Area=, which means that ~ ~ intersects at Am . Since (H,raa=, (7) is a Helly system 
with Helly number k, ~ must contain some subfamily ~ with 1~1 ~_., such that ~ does not intersect at 
Am . Every ~ G B must be in ~, since otherwise it would be the case that ~ ~ (~ ~) for some ~. This must 
be false~becauae ~ does not in­tersect at Am = while every (B ~) does. Therefore ~=~andl~l~k. D Application 
4.1. Line transversal of translates in the plane. Let T be a family of disjoint translates of a single 
convex object O in E2. Tverberg [T89] showed that if every family B ~ H with IBI ~ 5 admits a line transversal, 
then H also admits a line transversal. Egyed and Wenger [EW89] gave a deterministic linear time algorithm 
to find a line transversal. Showing that the problem can be formulated as GLP gives a simpler, although 
randomized, linear time algorithm. We assume that the family of translates is in general position (we 
will define general position in a moment); if not, we use a standard perturbation argument. The set X 
is the set of lines in the plane. We abuse notation so that trefers both to a translate t ~ T and to 
the set of lines intersecting t. So a subfamily G ~ T intersects when there is a line which intersects 
every translate in G. We pick a distinguished point q in the interior of the object O. Consider the 
family ~ of homothets formed by scaling translate tby a factor of A keeping the point in t corresponding 
to q tlxed in the plane. Every line which intersects the homothet Al t also intersects J2t for any A2 
> Al. So each ~ is a nested family of lines. For a family G~T,letAG={M ItGG}. IfweletJrange over [0, 
1], then the tAare always disjoint, every (JT, n) is a Helly system with Helly number 5, and (~, n) is 
a parameterized Helly system. The natural objective function w(~) is the mini­mum A such that GA intersects. 
In the case where ~ ~ ~ consists of a single translate, we define w(~ = O. Notice that for certain degenerate 
placements of the translates (see figure 1) it is possible for there to be two or even three distinct 
line transversals at 1 = w(c). Figur~ 1: Degenerate input The general position assumption is that the 
line transversal at 1 is always unique. (~, w) is a GLP problem with combinatorial dimen­sion 5. Either 
the GLP algorithm finds a line transver­sal at some value of J ~ 1, or no line transversal of the input 
exists. When O is a polygon with a constant number of sides, neither this algorithm nor Egyed and Wenger 
s is very interesting, since we can find a line transversal via a constant number of tlxed dimensional 
linear program­ming problems. Either algorithm is intended for more complicated polygons, in which the 
number of sidea de­pends on n, or for non-polygonal objects. Recall that the algorithm described in section 
2 runs in 0(% n + tb lg n) time, where t is the time required for a violation test and tb is the time 
required for a basis computation. In this application, a violation test deter­mines whether the current 
minimum line m intersects a new homothet At.For any m, there is a diameteral pair of points on O such 
that m intersects a homothet Atif and only if m passes between the corresponding points on M. We find 
such a diameteral pair during the basis computation whenever we find a new minimum line m, so t. is 0(1). 
The running time is then limited by tb; when the complexity of O is such that tb is O(n/ lg n), we get 
an expected linear time algorithm. Notice that here the dimension of the space X of lines in the plane 
is 2. If there were some afine structure on X such that the constraints T were convex subsets of X, then 
the Helly number of the system (T, n) would be 3. But examples show that the bound of 5 is in fact tight, 
which means that this is a GLP which is not a convex program. This is also a natural example of a GLP 
problem in which the minimal object does not touch every constraint in the basis. This paradigm may 
be profitably applied to many other Helly theorems. Application 4.2 Homothets spanning convex sets. 
We use theorem 2.1 from [DGK63], Theorem (Vincensini and Klee) Let K be a jinite family of at least d+ 
1 convex sets in Ed, and let C be a convex set in Rd. Then there is some translate of C which [intersects/ 
is contained injcontains] all members of K if and only if there is such a translate for every every d 
+ 1 members of K. We apply the paradigm by either growing or shrinking the convex body C, to get an algorithm 
which takes aa input a finite family K of at least d + 1 convex sets in Ed and a convex set C and returns 
either the smallest homothet of C which contains UK, the largest homo­thet of C contained in n K, or 
the smallest homothet of C which intersects every member of K. These prob­lems can be seen a a generalization 
of Megiddo s ball spanning balls problem [M89]. The combinatorial di­mension in each case is d + 1, and 
the running time again depends on the complexity of the objects. When C and all the elements of K are 
of constant complex­it y we get an expected linear time algorithm. In other cases, preprocessing can 
often be used to reduce the ob­vious running times; see, eg. [KM91] for a development of this idea in 
a different context. Application 4.3 Special cases of line transversals in Ed. In general, finding line 
transversals is significantly more difficult in dimension d > 2 than it is in the plane, but there are 
a few special cases in which Helly the­orems help us get a linear time algorithm. Theorems 5.6 and 5.7 
in [DGK63], due to Grunbaum, concern, re­ spectively, a family of d 1 dimensional polytopes, all of 
which lie in a family of parallel hyperplanes, and a family of spheres such that the distance between 
any two is greater than the sum of their diameters. In both these cases, if there is a line through every 
2d 1 objects then there is a line through all of them. Again, the first paradigm can be applied to give 
a linear time algorithm to find a line transversal. 2  5 GLP Problems from other GLP Problems Notice 
that the line transversal algorithm for translates finds a line which minimizes the maximum distance 
from the family of fixed points, under the metric whose unit ball is the object O. This mini-max property 
is useful in and of itself. We can apply the first paradigm to known GLP problems much as we would apply 
parametric search, to find the minimum value of A at which the problem is feasible. While parametric 
search usually adds an additional logarithmic factor to the running time, the expected time here remains 
linear. Application 5.1 Weighted Lm linear interpolation. The input to this problem is a family of n 
points in Rd, with an axis-aligned rectangle TP centered at each point p. Note that each TP may have 
different dimensions. The distance from a hyperplane h to p is the smallest nonnegative real value ~ 
such that TP intersects h when scaled by A. We call this the weighted L* metric. The linear interpolation 
problem is to find the h which minimizes the maximum distance to any point. This problem arises when 
we want to fit a hyper­plane to a family of points, and each coefficient of each point is given a weight, 
producing box-shaped error re­gions. This occurs, for example, when the coefficients are calculated and 
error is bounded using interval arith­metic, or when complicated error regions are approxi­mated by bounding 
boxes. The general-dimensional ver­sion of the problem haa been considered in [R89], [D91], and in [PR92], 
where it is shown to be NP-hard. Show­ing that the problem can be formulated as GLP gives a expected 
linear time algorithm for the fixed dimensional case. Define a positive hyperplane to be one which is 
oriented so that its normal vector is directed into the positive orthant of Ed. There is a diameteral 
pair of vertices v+, v-on each box such that, at any fixed value of ~, a positive hyperplane m goes through 
the 2The first of these problems can in fact be formulated as a linear program. box if and only if u+ 
and v-lie in its positive and negative halfspaces, respectively. Finding a positive hyperplane transversal 
of the boxes at atlxed value of J is thus the geometric dual form of a d-dimensional linear program with 
2n constraints. If a fixed positive hyperplane m goes through a box at J1, it also does so at any J2 
> Al. So for each constraint point v in the linear program, the set of hyperplanea for which u lies in 
the correct halfspace form a nested family parameterized by A. Finding the minimum value A which admits 
a positive hyperplane transversal of the boxes is a GLP problem of combinatorial dimension d + 1, again 
using a perturbation argument to ensure a unique minimum hyperplane. In the special case in which the 
boxes all have the same dimensions, the problem can be formulated as a linear program. In general, however, 
each point moves along a unique trajectory as A varies, and the constraints cannot be linearized. For 
a given family of boxes, we define a separate GLP problem for each orthant of Ed. The solution to the 
whole problem will be hyperplane which achieves the minimum A of any of the 2d GLP problems. Application 
5.2 Linear interpolation with a polyhe­dral metric. Consider the problem of finding a hyperplane transver­sal 
of a family of polytopes whose facets are drawn from a set U which is the union of a constant number 
of fam­iliea of parallel hyperplanes. Avis and Dorskis [AD92] show a similar reduction of this problem 
to a fixed num­ber of linear programming problems. Applying the first paradigm givea an expected linear 
time algorithm for fitting a hyperplane to a point family under any metric whose unit ball is a polytope 
with a constant number of sides, or, more generally, in which each point has an error metric whose unit 
ball is a polytope with facets drawn from U. Application 5.3 Line fitting in the weighted L@ met­ric. 
Megiddo has shown [M91] that the problem of finding a line transversal for a family of axis-aligned boxes 
in Ed can be formulated as a collection of linear programs in dimension 2d-2. We can again apply the 
first paradigm to find the cloees~ line to a family of points under the weighted Lw metric defined above. 
Observe that, in the previous examples, at any A (not necessarily one such that A = w(G) for some G), 
we can find some point in n GA by linear programming. This suggests a general way to remove the unique 
minimum assumption from the first paradigm. Theorem 5.1 Let (~, n) be a parametrized Helly sys­tem with 
parameter A and natural objective junction Wo. If there is a function WI such that every (HA, WI) is 
a GLP problem of combinatom al dimension < k, then there is a function w such that (~, w) is a GLP problem 
of dimension < 2k + 1. The proof of this theorem, which is similar to the proof of theorem 4.1, is omitted. 
The idea is that w is the parametric objective function (W., WI), where W. is the most significant parameter 
and WI is used as a tie-breaker. The following example shows that unfortunately this upper bound of 2k 
+ 1 on the combinatorial di­mension is the beat posible in such a general context. Theorem 5.2 There 
is a GLP problem, of the form described in theorem 5.1, in which every (HA, WI) is a GLP problem of combinatom 
al dimension < k, and (~, w) is a GLP problem of combinatorial dimension 2k+l. Proof: Consider an optimization 
problem in which the constraints h e H are sets of the form c:if~<b ZCEk, AGRlti%~ _m:if A>b { -} Here 
ii is a constant vector, and b and c are constants. The most significant objective wo is to minimize 
A, and the tie-breaking function WI is to minimize Z. feasible m~n - Figure 2: Size of basis is three 
 Observe that in figure 2, constraints a and b de­termine the minimum value of A, while constraint determines 
the minimum value of z. In general a ba­sis for (II, w) may contain of a basis of an infeasible k-dimensional 
linear program, determining ~, and an­ other, disjoint, basis of a feasible k-dimensional linear program 
determining z, so that its total size may be as large as 2k + 1. 0 6 Second Paradigm While the first 
paradigm is useful for many problems, it is not the one used by linear programming with a parametric 
objective function. Canthat objective func­tion be applied to other Helly theorems? Hoffman [H79] gave 
a paradigm for constructing a parameterized ob­jective function for a general Helly system, relating 
the Helly number to something he called the binding con. straint number. Here we relate it to the combinatorial 
dimension. Assume that we have a set X and a family C of subsets of X, such that C contains a nested 
family ~. For example, the family of convex subsets of Ed contains the nested families of parallel halfspaces. 
For any x E X, let the parameter of z defined by ~ be the index of the smallest set in ~ which contains 
x, or the special symbol $2if there is no such set. Thus one nested family defines a partial order on 
the elements of X. Several nested families act like a coordinate system. Assume that C contains d nested 
families ~i, . . . . ~d. Each x c X is thus equipped with a string of parameters (PI ,..., p~), although 
more than one z might share the same parameter string. We say that X is paramet erized by~~,...,~d. Theorem 
6.1 Let (C, f)) be a Helly system with Helly number k, embedded in X, where X is parametrized by~l,.. 
.~d C C. Define w(G) as the lexicographic minimum of the parameters of all x E (l G, or the special symbol 
Ct if n G = 0. Assume that, for all G~H, 1. w(G) ezists, and 2. if n G # 0, there is always aunique 
point z En G with parameter string w(G).  Then for any H ~ C, (H, w) is a GLP problem with combinatorial 
dimension s (k l)d. Proofi The constraints H are subsets of X, so observation 4.1 again implies that 
(H, w) obeys the monotonicity condition. Since there is exactly one point m with parameters w(G), the 
argument in the proof of theorem 4.1 shows that (H, w) meets the locality condition. Consider any G ~ 
H, and any basis B of G. If G does not intersect then IBI ~ k, and w(G) = w(B) = !2. So assume that G 
intersects. We consider each of the parameters of w(B) separately. Let pl be the most significant, p2 
the next most significant, and so on. For a parameter pi and a family G C C, let pi(G) be the ith parameter 
of w(G). For each parameter pi, let Bi ={h6Blpi(B ­ h) < pi(~) and Pj(l? h) = Pj(B), Vj < i}. That is, 
Bi is the family of constraints whose removal from B causes w(B) to decrease in the ith most significant 
parameter. Let p; = ma~{pi(B h) I h E Bi}. The value p; is the index of some set in P 6 C, a member 
of the nested family~i. For every h c Bi, Bi h intersects some member Ph of pi, such that Ph ~ P*, and 
hence Bi h intersects P*. But we know from the definition of Bi that fl Bi fails to intersect P*. Therefore 
the family Bi U {P*} must contain some family A of size ~ k such that A fails to intersect. It haa to 
be the case that P* G A, because otherwise A ~ Bi, which is impossible because we are assuming that Bi 
intersects and A does not. Also every h E Bi is also in c A, since otherwise A ~ (Bi h) U {P* }, which 
again is impossible because (Bi h) U {P*} intersects and A does not. So ]Bi[=lA1-l<k_l. For every i 
the number of elements in Bi is ~ k 1, and there are d parameters, so for the whole basis IBI~d(k-1). 
c1 The archetypal example of a Helly system of this sort is the convex sets in Ed, with the halfspaces 
defined by the coefficient hyperplanes as the nested families. But this problem has combinatorial dimension 
d, not d2 as theorem 6.1 would suggest. We get a better bound on the combinatorial dimension with the 
following little Theorem 6.2 1 for every H ~ C, there ezists some single nested family Q which imposes 
the same total order on the set of minima M = {m [m = w(G), G ~ H} as the parametric function w, then 
the combinatorial dimension of (H, w) is k 1. Proof: Let w~ be the single parameter function as­sociated 
with Q. Since w~ determines the same total order on M as w, itmeets conditions 1 and 2. By the same argument 
used in the last proof, every basis B of any G ~ H under w~ has size ~ k 1. But the bases are the same 
under the two functions; so (H, w) also has combinatorial dimension k 1. n For problems in Ed involving 
a finite number of con­vex objects and using a parameterized linear objective function determined by 
a lexicographic ordering on the coefficients, there is always some delicately tilted fam­ily of nested 
halfspaces which imposes the same order­ing on M as the parameterized linear function. One such family 
of halfspaces is the one with normal vector E,C2>.,,, Cd,for some c < 1. There will always be some c 
small enough, because the family M of constraints is fi­nite. This explains why using a parameterized 
objective function does not increase the combinatorial dimension for convex programming. For some Helly 
systems, the second paradigm can be used to construct a GLP problem but there is no such family Q. For 
instance, the family of axis aligned boxes in Ed has Helly number 2, but the combinatorial dimension 
of the resulting GLP problem is d. We can use this paradigm to define a GLP prob­lem in which the constraints 
are not even connected, let alone convex. This is interesting in that it implies we can sometimes use 
a single GLP problem to solve math­ematical programming problems in which the feasible region becomes 
disconnected, so long as the number of connected components remains fixed. Application 6.1 Pairs of 
convex sets. A family 1 of sets is intersectional if, for every H ~ I, (1 H E 1. Let C be the set of 
all convex sets in Rd, defined so as to include the empty set. Let Z = {(CI U C z) I Cl, Cz ~ C}. The 
whole family Z is not intersectional. But consider some subfamily Z which is intersectional. Then (Z 
, n) is a Helly system with Helly number 2(d + 1) [GM61]. As a concrete example, let each h c Z be a 
pair of spheres of radius 1, separated by a distance of 1 (kind of like dumbbells). Notice that we can 
adjoin the set S of spheres cen­tered at the origin to any intersectional family of pairs Z . Each sphere 
can be considered a pair with the empty set, and set Z U S remains intersectional since the in­tersection 
of a sphere with any pair of convex sets will produce s 2 convex sets. Let S. be the sphere of radius 
r centered at the origin. For any G ~ Z , let w(G) be the smallest r such that fl G n S, # 0. Notice 
that for any G, if r = w(G), lnGnSrl = 1. So (Z , w) is a G LP problem, where w is the one-parameter 
function defined by S, with combinatorial dimension 2d 1. Non-GLP Helly systems SC) far we have given 
paradigms for constructing a GLP objective function for a Helly system. These paradigms required additional 
geometric assumptions on the constraint families, beyond having a fixed Helly number. We now show that 
some such additional assumption is necessary, by exhibiting a set system with a fixed Helly number which 
cannot be turned into a fixed dimensional GLP problem. Theorem 7.1 There is a family H of 2n sets with 
Helly number 2 such that for any valid GLP objective function w the combinatorial dimension of (H, w) 
is n. Proofi Let the universe X consist of the 2 points at the vertices of an n dimensional hypercube, 
and let the ccmstraint family H be the 2n subsets each if which lies in a facet of the hypercube. Notice 
that if a subfamily G G H includes any pair of opposite facets, then G fails to intersect, and otherwise 
G does intersect. So the Belly number of (X, H) is 2. Any valid objective function w must assign w(G) 
= $2 to the infeasible families G which contain a pair of opposite facets. Meanwhile any feasible G which 
does not contain a pair of opposite facets will have w(G) = se S, with s< fl. Let s* = max{s GS1s< fl 
and s = w(G) for some G ~ H}, and consider some G with w(G) = s*. If IGI < n, then there exists some 
 pair (h+, h-) of facets, such that G contains neither h+ nor h-. This means that G+ h+ is also feasible. 
By the monotonicity condition, so w(G+h+) ~ w(G); and since w(G) is maximal, we can conclude that w(G 
+ h+) = w(G) = s*. This argument shows that there must be a subfamily G of size n with w(G) = s*. Now 
we show that there is no basis B for such a subfamily G such that B # G. Assume, for the pur­pose of 
contradiction, and without loss of generality, that there is some element h+ E G such that h+ @ B. B+ 
h-is still feasible, so w(B + h-) = w(B) = s*. But w(G + h-) = Q. Since B c G and w(B) = w(G), this means 
that w is not a valid objective function because it fails to satisfy the locality condition. So any valid 
ob­jective function w must have B = G, and (H, w) must have combinatorial dimension n. c1 This theorem 
says that the class of problems whose constraint sets have a fixed Helly number is strictly greater than 
the class of fixed dimensional GLP prob­lems. 8 Concluding Remarks The two paradigms should be useful 
in producing com­putational versions of other interesting Helly theorems such as those using spherical 
convexity and those con­cerning separating surfaces. There are many theorems similar to Helly theorems, 
such as Gallai-type theorems and Hadwiger-type theo­rems, and Helly-type theorems in which the fact that 
all subfamilies of size ~ k have some property p implies that the whole family has some other property 
q. It would be interesting to find algorithmic applications of these. Generalizing the many results about 
linear pro­gramming to other Helly systems may give interesting geometric results. 9 Acknowledgments
