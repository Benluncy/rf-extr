 EFFICIENT METHODS FOR GENERATING SOME EXPONENTIALLY TILTED RANDOM VARIATES Marvin K. Nakayama IBM Research 
Division T. J. Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, U.S.A. ABSTRACT Exponentially tilted 
distributions often arise as im­portance sampling distributions which are derived us­ing large deviations 
theory. In this paper we present simple and efficient methods for generating some ex­ponentially tilted 
random variates when the input dis­tribution is either a Weibull or a positive normal. In particular, 
our methods are acceptance-rejection al­gorithms, and we prove that the expected number of iterations 
tends to 1 as the tilting parameter in­creases to infinity. We also provide empirical results from using 
our proposed techniques. INTRODUCTION Exponential tilting (also known as exponentiid twist­ing or shifting) 
transforms a given distribution into a new one. Tilted distributions are often usecl in im­portance sampling 
schemes derived with the aid of large deviations theory; e.g., see Siegmund (1976), Cottrell, Fort, and 
Malgouvres (1983), Dupuis and Kushner (1987), Asmussen (1985), Parekh and Wal­rand (1989), and Sadowski 
and Bucklew (19910). This previous research showed that when using importance sampling, an exponentially 
tilted distribution min­imizes the variance of the resulting estimator over some class of possible changes 
of measure. While exponential changes of measure have been studied from a theoretical standpoint, there 
has not been substantial research that investigates how to ap­ ply them in practice. In particular, techniques 
for generating exponentially tilted random variates need to be developed. For certain distributions, 
exponential tilt ing only alters the parameter values of the input distribu­tion. This holds for the 
exponential famil,y, which includes the exponential, gamma, and normal distri­butions. However, when 
exponential tilting is applied to other distributions, the resulting distribution is not the same as 
the initial one (and often not one of the standard distributions). For example, this situa­tion occurs 
with the Weibull and positive (or trun­cated) normal distributions. In this paper we describe acceptance-rejection 
algorithms for generating expo­nentially tilted random variates based on these two input distributions. 
The proposed acceptance-rejection schemes have several desirable properties, First, the only inputs to 
our two algorithms are the parameters of the original distributions and the tilting parameter. This is 
ad­vantageous as the exponentially tilted distributions themselves depend on the input distributions 
mo­ment generating functions and there are no closed form expressions for these quantities. Als,o, the 
ma­jorizing densities in both cases are from standard distributions for which many fast and simple vari­ate 
generation techniques are available. Furthermore, our algorithms become more efficient as we increase 
the tilting. In particular, we prove that the expected number of iterations in our procedures tends to 
1 as the amount of tilting increases to infinity. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
2, we give a brief review of exponen­tially tilted distributions. We discuss our acceptance­rejection 
algorithm for generating exponentially tilted Weibull random variates in Section 3, and Section contains 
the same for the exponentially tilted posi­tive normal distribution. We present some empirical results 
in Section 5, and conclude with Section 6. 2 EXPONENTIALLY TILTED DISTRIBU-TIONS Let random variable 
X ~ O have distribution func­ tion F and mean p. Define #(O) = E [e- x] = /m e-eZF(dZ), o which is the 
moment generating function of X. Let A = {6 : @(O) < m]. For 6 E A, the exponentially 603 tilted distribution 
corresponding to F is given by e o F(clz) To (dz) = +(e) for z > 0, and O otherwise. Thus, exponential 
tilt­ing shifts increasingly more mass of the distribution towards O as O gets larger. The mean of the 
distribution Te is Using the notation #(0) = -$#(O), if O G A, then v(8) = @ ( O)/#(O), assuming that 
we can inter­change the order of the derivative and integral op­erat ors. 3 WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION The 
Weibull distribution is often used for modeling the time to complete a task or the time to failure of 
a piece of equipment; see Law and Kelton (1991), pp. 333 335. Depending on the choice of the shape parameter, 
the distribution has either an increasing or decreasing failure rate. Suppose that the random variable 
X has a Weibull distribution with shape parameter a > 0 and scale parameter /3 > 0. Its distribution 
function is given by F(z) = 1 exp{ (@)a} for z >0 and O otherwise, and its density is ~(z) = c@ za- 
exp{ (/3z) } for z >0 and O otherwise. The mean of a Weibull is I (1/a)/(cr@, where I (.) is the gamma 
function, and ~(~) =/m Ctp~ZU-I exp{-(pz)~ -oiz}~z o is its moment generating function. The density 
of the exponentially tilted Weibull distribution is for z >0 and O otherwise. Assume 0 > 0. Since exp{ 
(~z) } ~ 1 for all x~o, a~ffza-le-ox to(z) < go(z) = d(e) Hence, we will use ge as a majorizing function 
in an acceptance-rejection algorithm. To this end, define IVakayama Note that Ce ~ 1 for all O >0. Thus, 
the majorizing density is given by for x >0 and O otherwise, which is a gamma density with shape parameter 
a and scale parameter 0. Our acceptance-reject ion algorithm to generate exponen­ tially tilted Weibull 
random variates is as below. Algorithm for Generating Exponentially Tilted Weibull Variates 1. Generate 
Y N gamma(a, 8). 2. Generate U w uniform(O, 1), independent of Y. 3. If U < exp{ (@Y)~}, then return 
X = Y. Otherwise, reject (Y, U) and return to step 1.  There are many fast and simple methods for gener­ating 
the gamma random variate needed in step 1 of our algorithm; e.g., see Devroye (1986). In addition, note 
that in the algorithm, we do not need to know the value of ~(d). This is desirable since there is no 
closed form expression for #(O), and we would other­wise have to evaluate it numerically. The following 
result shows that the expected num­ber of iterations in our algorithm converges to 1 as the tilting parameter 
increases to infinity. Theorem 1 For an exponentially tilted Weibuii dis­tribution, Ce -+ 1 as 6 d co.

O as O + 00. Thus, using Generating Exponentially We now examine the results in Table 1. (All of the 
following observations also apply to Table 2, showing their robustness.) For each fixed value of Q and 
P, the average number of iterations in our acceptance­rejection scheme diminishes as O grows, which aLgrees 
with Theorem 1. In addition, the estimated mean of the exponentially tilted distribution decreases as 
6 increases. As a gets larger, we need to tilt the clistri­bution more in order to make the new mean 
sm~aller. This arises from the fact that as a + co, the Wleibull becomes degenerate at 1//3. Thus, more 
of the mass of the (original) distribution is tending toward larger values as a increases (and @ decreases). 
Finally, for the larger values of 0, 0(0) is approximately a/6, which can be explained as follows. Note 
that to is almost 1 for large 6, implying that the tilted distrib­ution is close to the majorizing distribution. 
(This is essentially what Theorem 1 states. ) The majorizing distribution is a gamma(cq 6), which has 
mean cr/@, thus showing the-desired property for large 6. Table 2: Results for Weibull Distribution with
