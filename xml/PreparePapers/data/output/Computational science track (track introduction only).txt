 Computational Science Track Computational Science lies at the core of Applied Computing. This track 
presents a set of six papers. The first paper describes a direct parallel method for solving non-linear 
Voitetra integro-differential equations with very near optimal speedup. The second paper addresses the 
important question of characterizing the average distance in a mesh slructure which is very important 
in quantifying the communication latency in intereonneetion networks. Analysis of optimal configurations 
to ensure reliability and performance is addressed in the third paper. The fourth paper discusses a new 
adaptive finite element scheme that admits one irregular element that is of potential interest in the 
analysis flows in porous media. A JAVA based schema for managing large scientific computational projects 
is the contents of the fifth paper. The last paper provides a clustering analysis of multi-model output 
for use in ensemble forecasting. Thanks to all the authors and reviewers for their interest and help. 
Looking forward to meeting all the authors at ;he conference. S. Lakshmivarahan Chair, Computational
