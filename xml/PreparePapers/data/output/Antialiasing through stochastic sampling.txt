 Abstract Stochastic sampling techniques, in particular Poisson and jittered sampling, are developed 
and analyzed. These approaches allow the construction of alias-free approximations to continuous functions 
using discrete calculations. Stochastic sampling scatters high frequency information into broadband noise 
rather than generating the false patterns produced by regular sampling. The type of randomness used in 
the sampling process controls the spectral character of the noise. The average sampling rate and the 
function being sampled determine the amount of noise that is produced. Stochastic sampling is applied 
adaptively so that a greater number of samples are taken where the function varies most. An estimate 
is used to determine how many samples to take over a given region. Noise reducing filters are used to 
increase the efficacy of a given sampling rate. The filter width is adaptively controlled to further 
improve performance. Stochastic sampling can be applied spatiotcmporally as well as to other aspects 
of scene simulation. Ray tracing is one example of an image synthesis approach that can be antialiased 
by stochastic sampling. CR Categories and Subject Descriptors: 1.3.3 [Computer Graphlen]: Picture/Image

use a spatial array of samples to create a displayed image. Since the displayed image is created from 
samples, some of the information contained in the original continuous scene description will be lost. 
An effective way of analyzing the resulting errors is to consider the frcqucncl? distortions that arise 
from sampling. The errors caused by regular sampling are Permission to copy without fee all or part of

as aliasing. A given sampling rate can only accurately represent frequencies lower than an associated 
bound. When frequencies higher than this hound exist, aliasing occurs. Display media also use a sequence 
of pixel arrays to create a time-varying image. Spatiotemporal sampling is an inherent part of current 
display media. Spatial aliasing error is often manifested by staircasing along edges in an image. Strobing, 
or the jerky motion of an object in an image, is a defect caused by temporal sampling. Defects from sampling 
can arise in other aspects of the displayed image, such as color. Since sampling attempts to approximate 
an image with only a finite set of values, errors are unavoidable. However, the nature of the errors 
introduced by sampling can be directly controlled. Conventional sampling uses a regular array of points 
to approximate the ideal image. 9 The aliasing errors that occur from this approach can create false 
patterns that are easily perceived. Increasing the sampling rate will allow higher and higher frequencies 
to be represented. However, any regular sampling rate has an associated frequency limit above which aliasing 
will still occur. By using an irregular sampling pattern and filtering the irregular samples to create 
the pixels, featureless noise is produced from such high frequencies rather than false patterns. Such 
noise is perceptually less objectionable than false patterns. This type of behavior is also produced 
by regular sampling patterns when sampling highly irregular images, such as can occur in natural scenes. 
Stochastic methods can be used to generate different classes of irregular sampling patterns. Such randomized 
sampling parterre correspond to statistical methods that are used to prevent biases from arising in discrete 
statistical samples. Poisson sampling uses sample points that are uniformly distributed throughout the 
sample space. The Poisson sampling technique can be generalized to a minimum distance Poisson process 
where the randomly distributed sample points are all separated by at least some minimum distance. Another 
important class of stochastic sampling patterns are jittered sampling patterns. Jittered patterns are 
created by taking regular sampling patterns and adding a random perturbation to each sample point. Assuming 
that the frequency content of an image is orientation independent, patterns such as jittered hezagonal 
sampling are more efficient than rectangular sampling patterns and can produce an image of a given quality 
with a lower sampling rate. The defects associated with stochastic sampling can be characterized as noise. 
Thns, the power signal to noise ratio (SNR) is an important figure of merit for stochastic sampling patterns. 
The SNR is directly proportional to the average sampling rate which is the average number of samples 
per unit region. Thus, the magnitude of the errors produced by stochastic sampling can be controlled 
by increasing the sampling rate. Since image complexity is itself distributed nonuniformly, the minimum 
acceptable average sampling rate can vary greatly across an image. An estimate of the error produced 
by a given sampling rate can be used to perform adaptive stochastic sampling. Adaptive sampling reduces 
the total number of samples required for a given image quality. The noise spectrum of a stochastic sampling 
pattern determines the amount of IocJversus high frequency noise that is generated. Since the human visual 
system is less sensitive to high frequency noise, reducing low and mid-frequency noise while increasing 
high frequency noise can produce perceptually better pictures. The separation between samples in minimum 
distance Poisson sampling and the magnitude of the perturbations in jittered sampling can be controlled 
to shape the associated noise spectrum. The stochastic samples are filtered to produce the final pixel 
values. The filtering process is an important part of noise reduction. A normalized filter that produces 
a weighted average of the sample points is an effective noise reducing filter. Adaptive filtering is 
also performed. The filter width can be adjusted to improve noise control at a given sampling rate. An 
important application of stochastic sampling is the antialiasing of ray traced images. Stochastic selection 
of the rays that are traced will ensure that the image is appropriately antialiased and can also improve 
the simulation calculations. There are four basic sections to this paper. Regular sampling patterns and 
the problems with aliasing are briefly outlined in § 2. Stochastic sampling patterns are introduced and 
analyzed in § 3. Sampling rate selection, adaptive sampling, filtering, and and adaptive control of noise 
are presented in § 4 and § 5. Implementation of stochastic sampling is discussed in § 5. Parts of this

Sampling Sampling is often carried out using a regular pattern. In one dimension, the samples are equally 
spaced. A commonly @ S I G G R A P H '85  used two dimensional pattern is a rectangular grid of sample 
points. Rectangular sampling can be performed in n-dimensional spaces in the same manner. The well-known 
sampling theorem ° states that the sample spacings in each dimension determine an associated frequency 
limit above which aliasing will occur. Given a sample spacing in one dimension, Az, the corresponding 
frequency bound in that dimension is given by 1 Nl/2 --2 Az (1) and corresponds to half of the Nyquist 
rate. The one dimensional unit rectangular sampling process has the following representation: 4-oo 4-oo 
 h(=)~f(~) X' ~= -k) ~ F(u), X' ~u -k)=H(u) (2) k ~---¢o k ~--.c<.~ where h is the sampled function, 
f is the original function, D denotes the Fourier transform relationship, F is the spectrum of the original 
function, and H is the spectrum of the sampled function. Thus, the spectrum of h is the spectrum of f 
plus copies of the spectrum of f that are spaced in each dimension by 2 Ni/2. Frequencies that are higher 
than Nl/z will spread over the replicated spectra and alter each of the copies. In general, there is 
no direct way of eliminating this foldover of high frequencies once sampling has been performed. Thus, 
it will be impossible to extract a single copy of F from H so that h will be a distorted version of f. 
This distortion is what is produced by aliasing. Given the frequency content of f, an appropriate sampling 
rate can be chosen. However, it is generally difficult to determine such a sampling rate a priori. If 
it is assumed that there is no preferred orientation in the high frequency content, then the frequency 
cutoff, Nq~, can be represented by an n-dimensional sphere of radius NiD. The most efficient sampling 
pattern will pack these spectral spheres as closely as possible in frequency space. 19 For 2-D, or spatial, 
sampling the optimal pattern is a hexagonal lattice and for 3-D, or spatiotemporal, sampling it is a 
body-centered cubic lattice. 3. Stochastic Sampling The primary weakness of regular sampling patterns 
is that they only sample a fixed set of points so that there are large regions that are never sampled. 
Features that lie in such regions are completely ignored. Regular sampling patterns ignore image information 
in a coherent way and produce coherent errors in the form of aliasing patterns. Irregular sampling patterns 
avoid generating false patterns by producing incoherent, or noisy, errors. Irregular patterns produced 
by randomness, or stochastic sampling patterns, will generate random incoherence, or broadband noise. 
The distribution of the stochastic samples determines the type of noise errors that occur. Stochastic 
sampling patterns have a probability of hitting each region of the image that in turn determines the 
probability of missing a given feature. It should be noted that coherent aliasing patterns are generated 
from coherent images; if the image itself is very irregular, then regular sampling will not produce false 
patterns. The mathematical properties of stochastic sampling have received a great deal of attention. 
4,7,15,1°,17,21,22 Much of this work concentrates on spectral estimation of stochastic processes. The 
results of Leneman 16 are particularly useful for the analysis of the stochastic sampling techniques 
that we will discuss. Stochastic sampling in physical processes has also been studied. Both the grain 
of photographic film and the receptor patterns of the human retina exhibit random sampling. 2~,a° SAN 
FRANCISCO JULY 22-26 Volume 19, Number 3, 1985 II Illll There are many different classes of stochastic 
sampling processes. The two that we will concentrate on are Poisson sampling and jittered sampling. A 
primary difference between these two types of sampling patterns are their noise spectra. In addition, 
jittered sampling is more local in nature. Examples of stochastic sampling patterns are shown in Figure 
1. The 2-D magnitude spectrum of a Poisson sampling pattern is shown in Figure 2. Note that the magnitude 
spectrum has only a *inole delta function at the origin and is surrounded by noise. This property is 
what enables stochastic sampling patterns to avoid the spectral replication of regular sampling patterns.

with 500 samples: magnitude (left) and phase (right). Poisson sampling over an infinite interval has 
samples which are uniformly distributed over any interval 18 and is therefore an approximation to uniform 
sampling. The development of the power spectrum for Poisson sampling relies on the fact that the impulae 
process is a widesense otationartt process (i.e. the statistics of the process do not vary with z) and 
is only approximate when the sampling pattern is of finite extent. 16 However, we will approximate uniform 
sampling with Poisson sampling in the sequel due to its analytical ease. The power spectral density (PSD) 
of the sampling process is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the process 27 and is given 
by 18 I Sx(n) 1 2 ~l,°(u) ----lira --/~ + 2~r~2~(u) (6) x--,oo X which is of the same form as the expected 
magnitude squared derived above in (5). This analysis can be extended to multiple dimensions in a straightforward 
manner. Given a widesense stationary one-dimensional image, f(z), which is independent of the Poisson 
sampling pattern, ,(z), the autoeorrelation of the sampled image, g(x)= f(x)-s(x), is given by p~(x) 
= pAx)p.(x) (7) where Ph(X)= E[h(z+x)h(z)] for any function h. Thus, the PSD of g can be expressed as 
the convolution  ¢0(u) = %(u),¢.(.) = ~f %(u)du + 2~2¢/(u) (s)R The first term on the right hand side 
can be identified aa a broadband noise spectrum and the second term as a scaled version of the originu! 
image spectrum. For the case where f is a fiat field, ~g will be the same as ¢°, and the noise term will 
be a constant 8-To compare Poisson and other sampling patterns, we will define the fiat field response 
hoist spectrum (FFRNS) to be the noise part of the fiat field response scaled by the sampling rate /~ 
and will represent it by ~n" For Poisson sampling, ~n ~ 1. All of the stochastic sampling patterns we 
will derive have a broadband noise power spectrum which is scaled by B- Although most image functions 
are not stationary, the above is an approximation which is useful in conceptualization and in calculating 
global parameters of the sampling process such as sampling rate and filter width. Also, many images are 
approximately localllj stationary so that these results apply locally. An important generalization of 
Poison sampling, minimum distance Poisson sampling, enforces a minimum distance between the sample points. 
A similar model has been used to characterize the distribution of receptors in the human eye. at In one 
dimension, we have an impulse process where the x k are taken to be the interval proeees and the I k 
have the delayed ezponential distribution ye -8'(t~'-t~ lk >I,o lk ~ p(l,) = (to) el~ewhert 12 Here, 
I~0 represents the minimum distance between samples. The average sampling rate for this process is the 
expected value of ih given by B = ~u/(l+Buik0). When Ik0=0, this sampling pattern becomes a Poisson sampling 
pattern with jg-~/~, ~ and, as//~---oo, the sampling pattern becomes a regular pattern with sampling 
rate ~-~1/1~o. Using a relationship for interval processes, 16 we can derive the sampling process power 
spectrum  [ 2fl~usin(l~oU)+2'~2cos(l~ou )--2fl~ 2 ] Cs( u ) .~ ~ t 213,usin(lkoU)_21~2cos(lkou)+u~+2/3~, 
u~O 2~ f~(tt ) u =0 The non-delta function part of this spectrum is the FFRNS. Figure 4 shows a plot 
of the FFRNS for two values of i~0/~. This sampling pattern is useful because low and mid frequency noise 
can be traded for high frequency noise by varying lk0 ~ between 0 and 1. The tradeoff between low, mid, 
and high frequency noise is an important one. Studies have shown that the human visual system is more 
sensitive to low/mid frequency noise than high S I G G R A P H '85 frequency noise. 3,12 Thus, perceptual 
noise control can be improved by trading reduced low/told frequency noise for increased high frequency 
noise in the sampling pattern. By increasing the minimum distance in Poisson sampling, low frequency 
noise can be reduced while increasing high frequency noise. Coherent a|iasing is only produced when the 
minimum distance is approximately equal to the spacing of the associated optima] regular sampling pattern. 
Subjective studies have also shown that the visual system is more sensitive to narrowband noise versus 
broadband noise. This supports the preference of noisy errors from stochastic sampling over the coherent 
aliasing errors of regular sampling. 3.2. Jittered Sampling Another important class of stochastic sampling 
patterns is jittered sampling patterns. In I-D, we choose a regular sampling pattern with sampling rate 
/~ and sample points Irk- Each of the samp]e points is jittered by adding a random variable Jk" Thus,

broadband noise, and the second term yields aliases of the input spectrum at multiples of the sampling 
rate as in regular sampling. These aliases will add in coherent noise and create false patterns. However, 
these aliases are weighted by I'~u)l a. For certain jitter densities, the aliases can be exactly canceled 
out by the terns of "/. For example, if P(Jk) is ~miform over [-1/21~,1/2/~], then sin(./2~) _ sine(u/2~)

function at u=0. Figure 5 shows the FFRNS for this case. This sample distribution removes low frequency 
noise compared to the Poisson case, but avoids the high frequency peaks which appear in minimum distance 
Poisson sampling. Another difference between jitter and minimum distance Poisson is that if one jitters 
with a uniform density over an interval smaller than [-1/2~,1/2~], sharp aliases appear immediately instead 
of forming gradually out of broadband high frequency noise. However, these aliases are attenuated by 
~u), so that the Figure 5 Figure .4 FFRNS for uniform jitter. FFRNS for/no fl -~ 0.5, 0.95 from left 
to right. SAN FRANCISCO JULY 22-26 amount of jitter can be used to trade off aliasing energy for noise 
energy. Figure O shows magnitude spectra of computer simulations of jitter which is uniform over [-a/20,0/2,8] 
for a ~ 1.0 and 0.5 from frequencies of -4rc,g to 47r8 radians. Note that a ---- 0.0 is regular sampling. 
In the noise and adaptivity analyses which follow, we will only consider jitter which is without aliases, 
i.e. a = 1.0. In multiple dimensions, rectangular sampling with uniform rectangular jitter will yield 
a power spectrum which also has an FFRNS that is smaller in the low frequencies. Such a sampling pattern 
is implemented by choosing a point uniformly in a rectangle centered around the nominal sample value. 
If the input is two-dimensional and the frequency content is orientation independent, the optimal sampling 
pattern is hexagonal. Jittering this pattern is performed by choosing point uniformly in a hexagon which 
surrounds the nominal sample value. This will also lead to a sampling pattern which is without aliases 
as long as the jitter hexagons completely tile the space of interest. In three dimensions, one can uniformly 
jitter a body-centered cubic pattern to create a pattern which will not produce aliases. The reduction 
in low frequency noise with jittered sampling is better perceptually as with minimum distance poisson. 
4. Sampling Rate The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is an important measure of the quality of the sampling 
process. The average sampling rate determines the basic cost of a given stochastic sampling pattern. 
Consider g,(~')= f(~)- s(W)*r(~), which represents the sampled and filtered original image before it 
is resampled for .2 2. Figure 6 Spectra for uniform jitter with a equal to 1.0 and 0.5 from left to 
right. display. Its power spectrum is The stochastic sampling patterns which were developed above and 
which did not produce aliasing have power spectra which are of the form 0.(~) = 2a7/2~(@) + fl¢.(V) (17) 
where ion is the FFRNS of the sampling pattern and q,~ does not depend on ~. These patterns axe: Poisson, 
minimum distance Poisson with broad high-frequency peaks, and uniformly distributed jitter without aliases. 
Substitution of (17) into (16) yields ~g,(~)=21rfl~4~t(~). IR(~)i 2+~(4,$(~),~.(~.)).1R(~) i 2 (18) Therefore, 
the ratio of the total signal power to the total noise Volume 19, Number 3,1985 I II~I power is given 
by the ratios of the integrals of the two terms on the right hand side of (18). The root-mean-square 
(RMS) signal to noise ratio (SNR) is given by the square root of this and more accurately represents 
the perceptual signal to noise ratio: II S [I (2/r~)1/21[ ~f*t'lRt'd~" ,]'/" --= ...... _J 09) I N IRMS 
[~(~I "*,)" I R I 'du l where the dependence of everything on ~ has been dropped for clarity. Note that 
the SNR only increases as fast as the square root of the average sampling rate. Also, if R is held constant 
and the bandwidth of f is increased pat the spectral width of R, the SNR is reduced as the inverse square 
root of the bandwidth of f. Similarly, if f is held constant and the width of R is increased past the 
bandwidth of f, the SNR is reduced as the inverse square root of the spectral width of R. A number of 
different criteria can be used to choose an acceptable value of the SNR for a given sampling pattern 
and thus the sampling rate. The display device will require qnantizing the data to a fixed length word. 
Noise with a variance which is much less than a bit in value will not disturb the image. The limitations 
of the human visual system are another source of acceptable noise levels. Experiments have indicated 
that a SNR of about 100 (40 db) is just sufficient to prevent objectionable noise. 5 Another criterion 
is the performance under worst ease conditions. However, a worst case sampling rate is prohibitively 
high and will not reflect the nature of most images. If the expected image spectrum is known, the best 
FFRNS can be chosen directly. However, the expected spectrum for the types of images that are synthesized 
is difficult to develop. A useful way of selecting an a priori sampling rate is based on the expected 
size of the "smallest" important feature. For example, the sampling rate can be chosen such that small 
features will not be missed by the sampling process with a desired probability. Consider a one-dimensional 
Poisson sampling pattern with sampling rate f?; the inter-sample distance d has distribution P[d <k] 
= 1-e -~x (20) Thus, to insure with probability Po that a feature of size ~ is sampled, we need to have 
In(l-P0) in the region containing that feature. 4.1. Adaptive Sampling Rate The SNR and sampling rate 
discussed above are global. However, complexity is not uniformly distributed across an image. An adaptive 
sampling rate can greatly reduce the number of samples required to create an image of a given quality. 
A probabilistic estimate of the local image characteristics, based upon a set of stochastic samples taken 
around the region, can be used to calculate an appropriate sampling rate. If the sample values are very 
similar, then a smooth region is indicated and a lower sampling rate can be used. Conversely, very dissimilar 
samples indicate a rapidly varying region that requires a higher sampling rate (e.g. the boundaries of 
rapidly moving objects). To calculate the local sampling rate adaptively, we need an error estimator, 
an error bound which must be satisfied, and an initial sampling rate at which to begin the adaptation. 
The error bound and initial sampling rate can be developed from the   @ S I G G R A P H '85 ! I mllmll 
criteria discussed previously. However, the variance of the error estimator as a function of the number 
of samples used in the. estimate must also be considered. If the number of samples used to estimate the 
error is very small, the variance of the estimator will be high, and the confidence in the error estimate 
will be low. Global or local spectral techniques can be used to estimate the error between the optimally 
filtered image and the stoch~tieally sampled and filtered image. It has been shown that the RMS SNR is 
equal to the square root of the sampling rate times a constant which depends on the image spectrum and 
the filter. Since the signal is fixed, the total RMS error in the reconstruction, etot(T;fl), is the 
inverse square root of fl times a constant C which does not depend on/Y etot(r;~) = ~-t/zC( % ,R,r) (22) 
This RMS error is approximately the expected absolute difference between the the stochastically sampled 
and filtered image, g,, and the perfectly filtered image, f*ro: eto,(~';,8) ~ I g,(~; ~) -f(~)*ro(T)l 
(23) Thus, the difference between the images at two sampling rates should be an estimate of the rate 
of change of etot(~;,8) with re~pect to /Y. From this and the fact that etot(~;fl ) is expected to be 
monotonically decreasing in/Y, C can be estimated by [ gr(~; f12) -- g,(E"; ill) [I (24) C=I I fl~-l/2 
_ ffi-l/~ I We can average C over several different sets of/~¢ and use (22) to produce an estimate of 
¢tot(~ ). This is then compared to a user specified error bound eb. If the estimate is less than the 
bouad, no more has to be done. Otherwise, more samples need to be taken in the region of the filtered 
sample. Figure 7 shows the linear dependence of sampling rate upon slope using this error estimate. Other 
estimators can of course be used. One estimator can be developed truing a linear approximation for the 
image function in the neighborhood of a stochastic sample point, since the local RMS error is directly 
proportional to the magnitude of the local slope. 10 Also, the variance of the samples in the region 
of a pixe| can be used to estimate the required sampling rate, as it is proportional to the bandwidth 
of the image function in the region.  5. Filtering Stochastic sampling is only one step in the entire 
synthesis process. The stochastic sample values are then used to create Figure 7 Dependence of sampling 
rate upon slope. Sampled function is shown on left and adapted sampling rate on right. the pixel values 
that are used by the display to reconstruct the final image. An important part of this process is the 
filter used to create the pixel values from the stochastic samples. Aliaslng defects are reduced by choosing 
a filter which passes little of the frequencies beyond half the display Nyquist rate. The filter must 
also control noise from the stochastic sampling process as much as possible. In addition, the display 
reconstruction filter should be taken into account. There are several particular characteristics that 
can be used to choose a good filter. The response to discontinuities, such as edges, should be somewhat 
smooth. A perfect iowpasa filter applied to an edge will result in a visible ringing at the edge due 
to Gibb's phenomenon. 27 Unfortunately, low-pass filters with smoother responses have inferior high frequency 
response, so one must make a tradeoff depending on the application. The filter should also have an impulse 
response which is always positive since the light intensity on the screen is non-negative. Raised cosine 
functions have been used in digital filter design to reduce Gibb's phenomenon) They also exhibit reasonable 
low-pass behavior and axe non-negative. The particular form of the raised cosine that we will be using 
is given by 13 r(~)= 1 , ,2~r -~-Icos(-~- I~1 ) + 1) I~l < W (25) where r is the filter, W is the radius 
of the filter, and I Y I is the distance from the center of the filter. Filter selection is important 
for any antialiasing method. Filters that have been used in conjunction with oversampling in computer 
graphics have often been poor at attenuating aliased frequencies. For example, a triangular filter with 
a radius of about one pixel that is maximal at the center and zero at the boundary has been suggested. 
° The aliasing attenuation of such a filter is inadequate. A triangular filter that spans 1.75 pixels 
in each direction trades off some high frequency response, but provides 90% attenuation at N1/2. 6.1. 
Adaptive Filtering The ability of stochastic sampling to generate broadband noise rather than coherent 
aliases is the reason its behavior is superior to regular sampling. The preference of the human visual 
system to low levels of noise versus coherent features has been used in other ~pects of imaging, such 
as the reduction of quantization defects. 2° Even though noise is often preferable to coherent defects, 
large levels of noise are very objectionable and must be controlled. The noise level is directly related 
to the input signal, the sampling rate, and to the filter. Sine,e practical filter designs will be windowed 
so that the filter support is small, the number of samples under the filter will vary depending on the 
location of the stochastically placed samples and the location of the filter. To reduce noise caused 
by local changes in the sampling rate, one should normalize the filter. A one-dimensional example is 
given by g--1 f(zk)r(z--Xk)  g,(x) = l/(=)',(~)]*r(=) = ~=0 (26) M~)*r(~)] K-, k==0 We will assume 
this discrete normalization is always applied. Given samples of a fiat (or nearly fiat) field, this filter 
will remove noise without the use of a very wide convolution. Also, filtering of locally linear functions 
can be shown to have a non- biased error when this normalization is used. It is also possible to determine 
the optimal (with respect to mean-squared-error) linear filter for the stochastic samples. We
