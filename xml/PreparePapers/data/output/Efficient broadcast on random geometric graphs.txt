Sauerwald§ Alexandre Stau.er¶ Abstract A Random Geometric Graph (RGG) in two dimensions is constructed 
by distributing n nodes independently and uniformly at randomin[0, v n ]2 and creating edges between 
everypair of nodeshaving Euclideandistance at most r, for some prescribed r. We analyze the following 
randomized broadcast algorithm on RGGs. At the beginning, only one node from the largest connected component 
of the RGG is informed. Then, in each round, each informed node chooses a neighbor independently and 
uniformly at random -1 ) and informs it. We prove that with probability 1-O(n this algorithm informs 
every node in the largest connected v component of anRGG within O( n/r+logn)rounds. This holds for any 
value of r larger than the critical value for the emergence of a connected component with O(n) nodes. 
In order to prove this result, we show that for any two nodes su.ciently distant from each other in [0, 
v n ]2 , the length of the shortestpathbetweenthemintheRGG, when such a path exists, is only a constant 
factor larger than the optimum. This result has independent interest and, in particular, gives that the 
diameter of the largest connected v component of an RGG is T( n/r), which surprisingly has been an open 
problem so far. 1 Introduction ARandom Geometric Graph (RGG)isagraphresulting from placing n nodes independently 
and uniformly v at random on [0,n ]2 and creating edges between pairs of nodes if and only if their Euclidean 
distance is at most some .xed r. These graphs have been studiedintensively in relation to subjects such 
as cluster analysis,statisticalphysics,hypothesistesting[12], and wireless sensor networks [14]. One 
further application of RGGs is modeling data in a high-dimensional space, *Theoretical Division and Center

then depicts the similarity between data elements in the high-dimensional space. In this work, we are 
speci.cally interested in the problem ofbroadcasting information in randomgeomet­ricgraphs(RGG)intwodimensions. 
Thestudyofinfor­mationspreading in largenetworkshasvariousapplica­tions indistributed computing. Typically,thebroadcast 
algorithm shouldbe simple, be resilient againstfailures, and work locally, i.e., the nodes cannot be 
assumed to have any prior knowledge about the global topology of the network. One simple algorithm of 
this kind is the randombroadcast(a.k.a. thepush algorithm)[8], which we study here. In this algorithm, 
in each round each informed node chooses a neighbor independently and uniformly at random and informs 
it. The random broadcast algorithm has been .rst analyzed on complete graphs by Frieze and Grimmett [9], 
who proved that with probability 1 - o(1), the runtime is log2 n + lnn + o(logn). This result was later 
further improved by Pittel [13]. Feige et al. [8] proved that on any graph, the runtime is at most O(nlog 
n) with probability 1 -O(n-1), and that for any bounded-degree graph, O(diam(G)) rounds are su.cient, 
where diam(G) stands for the diameter of the graph. Furthermore, they established a runtime of O(logn) 
on hypercubes and su.ciently dense random graphs with probability 1-O(n-1). In [6], two of the authorsextended 
this resultto othergraphsbyproving an upper bound of O(diam(G) + logn) for di.erent Cayleygraphs. A di.erent 
broadcasting model known as Radio Broadcasting has also been studied on RGGs [4, 10]. In this model, 
every transmission by a node is sent to all neighbors. However, if two(or more) transmissions are sent 
to the same node in one round, then this node cannot receive the message. In order to derive an e.cient 
algorithm for radio broadcasting on these graphs, Lotker and Navarra solved this problem .rst on a grid 
[10]. Then, they emulated the corresponding gridprotocolonRGGs, and obtained an asymptotically optimal 
algorithm for broadcasting in the case when the graph is connected with high probability. However, the 
result of [10] only holds if each node is aware of its own position. Later, Czumaj and Wang considered 
various scenarios with respect to the local knowledge of each node in the graph, and showed that in many 
settings radio broadcasting1 can be solved in time O(diam(G))[4].  Aproblem related to broadcasting 
that has already been studied for RGGs is the cover time of random walks [1, 3]. In [1], Avin and Ercal 
considered random geometric graphs in two dimensions when the coverage radius is a constant larger than 
the minimum coverage radius that assures the RGG to be connected with probability 1-o(1). They proved 
that in this regime, the cover time of an RGG is T(nlog n)withprobability 1 - o(1), which is optimal 
up to constant factors. Recently, Cooper and Frieze [3] gave a more precise estimate of the cover time 
on RGGs that extends also to larger dimensions. However, all of these works are restricted to the case 
where the probability that the RGG is connected goes to 1 as n .8. In this work, we analyze a wider range 
for r and we focus on the regime where the RGG is likely to contain a connected component with O(n) nodes. 
We prove that if one node from the largest connected component of an RGG uses the random broadcast algorithm 
to disseminate a piece of information, then with probability 1 -O(n-1), all nodes in the same connected 
component receive the information within v O( n/r+ logn) rounds. In particular, if the RGG turns out 
to be connected, then all nodes get informed v after O( n/r+ logn)rounds. In ourproofforthis result, 
we also showthatfor any two nodes having su.ciently large Euclidean distance, theirdistance intheRGGisjust 
aconstantfactor larger thantheoptimum. Inparticular,thisresultshowsthat the diameter of the largest connected 
component of v anRGG isT( n/r) in the case where a connected component with O(n) nodes is likely to 
exist. This result has independent interest and, to the best of our knowledge, was onlypreviouslyknownforthe 
case when the RGG is connected with probability 1 - o(1) [5]. Our techniques are inspired by percolation 
theory and we believe them to be useful for other problems, like estimating the cover time for the largest 
connected component of RGGs. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a 
precise de.nition of the random 1 In[4]the so-calledgossipingproblemhasbeen considered,i.e., each node 
possesses a di.erent message, and all these messages have to be disseminated e.ciently to every node 
in the graph. However, by solving the gossiping problem they also solved the broadcasting problem. broadcast 
algorithm and the random geometric graph, as well as introduce some notation and state our results. In 
Section 3, we derive an upper bound for the length of the shortest path between two nodes in an RGG provided 
their Euclidean distance. In Section 4, we perform the runtime analysis of the random broadcast algorithm. 
We close in Section 5 with some conclusive remarks. 2 Precise Model and Results We consider the following 
random broadcast algorithm also known as the push algorithm (cf. [8]). We are given an undirected graph 
G. At the beginning, called round 0, a node s of G owns a piece of information, i.e., it is informed. 
In each subsequent round 1,2,..., each informed node chooses a neighbor independently and uniformly at 
random and transmits a copy of the information to that neighbor, which thus becomes informed. We are 
interested in the runtime of this algorithm, which is the time until every node in G gets informed; in 
case of G being disconnected, we require every node in the same connected component as s to get informed. 
The runtime of this algorithm is a random variable denoted by R(s,G). Our aim is to prove bounds on R(s,G) 
that hold with probability 1-O(n-1). We study R(s,G)forthe caseof a randomgeomet­ric graph G in two dimensions. 
We de.ne the random v geometric graph in the space O = [0,n ]2 equipped with theEuclidean norm, which 
wedenoteby .·.2. The most natural de.nition of RGG is stated as follows. Definition 1. (cf. [12]) Let 
Xn = {X1,X2,...,Xn} be points in O chosen independently and uniformly at random. The random geometric 
graph G(Xn;r)has node set Xn and edge set {(x,y):x,y .Xn,.x -y.2 . r}. In our analysis, it is more advantageous 
to resort to the following de.nition. Definition 2. (cf. [12]) Let Nn be a Poisson ran­dom variable with 
parameter n and let Pn = {X1,X2,...,XNn }be points chosen independently and uniformly at random from 
O; i.e., Pn is a Poisson Point Process over O with intensity 1. The random ge­ometric graph G(Pn;r) has 
node set Pn and edge set {(x,y):x,y .Pn,.x -y.2 . r}. Thefollowingbasic lemmasaysthat any resultthat 
holds in the setting of De.nition 2 with su.ciently large probability can be translated to the setting 
of De.nition 1. Lemma 2.1. Let A be any event that holds with proba­bility at least 1-a in G(Pn;r). Then, 
A also holds in v G(Xn;r)with probability 1-O(an ).  Henceforth, we consider anRGGgivenbyG = G(Pn;r), 
and refer to r as the coverage radius of G. It is known that there exists a critical value rc for the 
coverage radius suchthat if r> rc, then withhighprobabilitythe largest connected component of G has cardinality 
O(n) and allthe other connected componentshave cardinality O(log2 n). On the contrary, if r<rc, each 
connected component of G has O(logn) nodes with probability 1-o(1)[12]. The exactvalue of rc is notknown, 
though some bounds have been derived in [11]. In addition, if logn+.(1) r = , then G is connected with 
probability p 1-o(1).2 Our main result is stated in the next theorem. It shows that if r>rc, then for 
all s inside the largest v connected component of G, R(s,G)= O( n/r+logn) with probability 1 -O(n-1). 
Note that rc does not depend on n, but if r is regarded as a function of n, then here and in what follows, 
r>rc means that this strict inequality must hold in the limit as n .8. Theorem 2.2. For a random geometric 
graph G = v G(Pn;r), if r>rc, then R(s,G)= O( n/r+ logn) with probability 1 -O(n-1) for all node s inside 
the largest connected component of G. The proof of Theorem 2.2, which we provide in Section 4, requires 
an upper bound for the length of the shortest path between nodes of G. Our result on this matter, which 
is stated in the next theorem, gives that for any two nodes that are su.cientlydistant from each other 
in O, the distance between them in the metric induced by G is only a constant factor larger than the 
optimum with probability 1 -O(n-1). In particular, this result implies that the diameter of the v largest 
connected component of G is O( n/r), a result logn+.(1) previously known only for r =. p For all v1,v2 
. G, we say that v1 and v2 are connected if there exists a path in G from v1 to v2, and de.ne dG(v1,v2)as 
the distance between v1 and v2 on G, that is, dG(v1,v2) is the length of the shortest path from v1 to 
v2 in G. Also, we denote the Euclidean distancebetweenthe locationsofv1 and v2 by.v1-v2.2. Clearly,the 
smallestpathbetweentwo nodes v1 and v2 in G must satisfy dG(v1,v2). .v1 -v2.2/r. Theorem 2.3. If r>rc, 
for any two connected nodes v1 and v2 in G = G(Pn;r) such that .v1 - v2.2 = O(log3.5 n/r2), we obtain 
dG(v1,v2)= O(.v1 -v2.2/r) with probability 1-O(n-1). 2 At this point it is important to remark that all 
logarithms in this paper refer to the natural logarithm. Corollary 2.4. If r>rc, the diameter of the 
largest v connected component of G = G(Pn;r)is O( n/r)with probability 1-O(n-1). 3 The Diameter of the 
Largest Connected Component We devote this section to prove Theorem 2.3. We consider G = G(Pn;r) with 
r>rc and assume that v v r = O( log n ). (Whenr = .( log n ),G is connected with probability 1 - o(1) 
and Theorem 2.3 becomes a slightly di.erent version of [5, Theorem 8].) We show that for any two connected 
nodes v1 and v2 of G such that .v1-v2.2 =O(log3.5 n/r2), we obtaindG(v1,v2)= O(.v1 -v2.2/r)with probability 
1-O(n-1). We .rsttaketwo .xednodes v1 and v2 satisfyingthe conditions above and show that dG(v1,v2)= 
O(.v1 - v2.2/r) with probability 1 -O(n-3). Then, we would like to take the union bound over all pairs 
of nodes v1 and v2 to conclude the proof for Theorem 2.3, however the number of nodes in Gis a random 
variable andhence the unionbound cannotbe employeddirectly. We resort to the following lemma to extend 
the result to all pairs of nodes v1 and v2. Lemma 3.1. Let E(w1,w2) be an event associated to a pair 
of nodes w1,w2 . G = G(Pn,r). Assume that for all pairs of nodes, Pr [E(w1,w2)] . 1-p, with p> 0. Then, 
. . 2 -O(n) Pr . E(w1,w2). . 1-9np-e. w1,w2.G Proof. We condition on Nn . 3n. Using a Cher­no. bound 
for Poisson random variables, it follows -O(n) easily that Pr [Nn > 3n] . e. Let Ec(w1,w2) denote the 
complement of E(w1,w2). Note that Pr[Ec(w1,w2)] p Pr [Ec(w1,w2) |Nn . 3n] .. Pr[Nn.3n]1-e-O(n), for all 
w1,w2 . G. Therefore, using the de.nition of conditional probabilities and the union bound, we ob­tain

Illustration for the calculation of dG (v1,v2 ), with the large r × r/3 rectangle Rk and the cells S2k-1 
and S2k contained in Rk . We use Figure 1 as a reference to show how to .nd a path from v1 to v2. Take 
the line L that contains v1 and v2 and draw a sequence of adjacent rectangles startingfrom v1 until wedraw 
a rectangle that contains v2. Each rectangle has two sides with length r/3 that areparallel to L and 
two other sides with length r that are perpendicular to L such that their middle point is contained in 
L. Let . be the number of such rectangles and refer to them as R1,R2,...,R.. For each k . [1,.], L splits 
Rk into two identical, smaller rectangles which we denote by S2k-1 and S2k and refer to as cells. ' Note 
that for any k and twopoints x . Sk and x . Sk+2, we obtain .x - x ' .2 . (2r/3)2 +(r/2)2 . r, that is, 
nodes in Sk and Sk+2 are neighbors in G. For this reason, we say that the cell Sk is adjacent to the 
cells Sk-2 and Sk+2. Note that v1 belongs to both S1 and S2.Wewould liketo.nd apathfrom v1 to v2 that 
starts at either S1 or S2 and moves along adjacent cells, but some Sk may contain no node. Our choice 
for the length of the largest sides of the rectangle Rk is intended to achieve the following property. 
For any path in G that crosses the region . Ri, in the sense that there exists an edge of the i=1 . path 
that intersects Ri, it must be the case that i=1 . thepath contains a node inside Ri. Thisproperty i=1 
iscrucial inouranalysis,since itguaranteesthat apath crossing two rectangles Rj and Rk provides apath 
from a node in Rj toanode in Rk in G and can be used to move around cells that contain no nodes. We refer 
to a cell as empty if it contains no node. For any empty cell Sk with Sk-2 being nonempty, we follow 
the shortest path from a node in Sk-2 to some nonempty Sk' for k ' . k+1. Note that there is always such 
a k ' since R. = S2.-1 . S2. contains v2. Our aim is to give a bound for the length of the detour around 
empty cells. The path starts at v1 . R1. For 3 . k . 2., if Sk is empty and Sk-2 is not empty, let Dk 
bethe lengthoftheshortestpathfrom Sk-2 to some Sk' for k ' . k+1. If Sk is not empty, we set Dk = 0. 
Also, if Sk and Sk-2 areboth empty, then we also set Dk = 0, since thedetour around Sk-2 will eithergo 
around Sk as well or lead to Sk-1, from which we can obtain an edge to Sk+1 or a detour that goes around 
Sk. With these .2. de.nitions we can write dG(v1,v2). .+ Dk. k=3 In order to calculate Dk, we exploit 
the idea of crossingsfrom continuumpercolation. For an odd num­ber k . 1, we consider the cells Sk-2,Sk-1,Sk,Sk+1. 
Let Qk(1) be the rectangle containing all these cells, that is, Qk(1) = R(k-1)/2 . R(k+1)/2. Let Qk(.)be 
a rectangle having the same center as Qk(1) and whose sides are parallel to those of Qk(1) and have length 
given by . times the side lengths of Qk(1) (in other words, Qk(.) is a stretched version of Qk(1)). Then, 
for any odd number k . 1 and .> 1, we de.ne the annulus A(Sk,.)= A(Sk+1,.)= Qk(.)\ Qk(1) (see Figure 
2(a)). An annulus A(Sk,.) can be decomposed into two horizontal rectangles (Z1Z4Z5Z12 and Z11Z6Z7Z10 
in Figure 2(b)) and two vertical rectangles (Z1Z2Z9Z10 and Z3Z4Z7Z8 in Figure 2(b)). For a horizontal 
rect­angle, we de.ne a horizontal crossing as a path in G completely containedin the rectangle and that 
connects the left to the right side of the rectangle, i.e., with the .rst node of the path being within 
distance r to the left side of the rectangle and the last node of the path being within distance r to 
the right side of the rect­angle. Similarly, for a vertical rectangle, we de.ne a vertical crossing as 
a path in G that is completely con­tained in the rectangle and that connects the top to the bottom side 
of the rectangle. For an annulus A(Sk,.), we de.ne F(A(Sk,.)) as the event that both horizon­tal rectangles 
of A(Sk,.)have ahorizontalcrossing and that both vertical rectangles of A(Sk,.) have a verti­cal crossing. 
This event is illustrated in Figure 2(c). Note that when F(A(Sk,.)) happens, then the afore­mentioned 
crossingsprovide a cycle around Sk. We now explain how to use the annuli to .nd detours around an empty 
cell Sk. Note that S1 and S2 contain v1 and, consequently, are not empty. Now suppose that Sk-2 is not 
empty and is connected to v1, i.e., there is a path from v1 to a node inside Sk-2. If Sk is also not 
empty, then the node inside Sk is a neighbor of the node in Sk-2, and we obtain a path from v1 to Sk. 
Now, assume that Sk is empty. We want to use the path from v1 to Sk-2 to construct a path from v1 to 
some Sk' with k ' . k + 1. Clearly, for any .> 1, the annulus A(Sk,.) intersects neither Sk-2 nor Sk, 
but does intersect Sk+2. Take . ' such that F(A(Sk,. ' ))happensandletH . Qk(. ' )be the largest region 
delimited by the cycle surrounding Sk that is induced by the crossings of A(Sk,. ' ). If v1 .. H, then 
the path from v1 to Sk-2 provides a path from Sk-2 to the crossings of A(Sk,. ' ). If the crossings intersect 
some nonempty Sk' , k ' . k +1, then there is a path  A(Sk,.)=A(Sk+1,.) Z5 Z12 r .r Z11 Z6  Qk(1)

horizontal and vertical rectangles. And part(c) illustrates the event F(A(Sk ,.))for theleft-to-right 
and top-to-bottom crossings(depicted as curvylines) of A(Sk ,.). entirely contained in H from Sk-2 to 
a node inside Sk' . If such a Sk' does not exist, it must be the case that v2 . H. Since v1 and v2 are 
connected, there is a path from v2 to the crossing of A(Sk,. ' ), and, consequently, there is a path 
from Sk-2 to v2 completely contained in H. Now, if v1 . H and Sk' as above exists, then the path from 
v1 to v2 intersects the crossings of A(Sk,. ' ) and can be used to obtain a path completely contained 
in H from Sk-2 to Sk' . Finally, if v1 . H and v2 . H, then there is a path from v1 to v2 entirely contained 
in H. This shows that whenever v1 and v2 are connected, we can use the annuli to movefrom Sk to Sk' , 
k ' . k+1, or to move directly to v2. Note that the construction of Sk and A(Sk,.)are independent from 
v1 and v2 being connected and are taken for two arbitrarily .xed nodes v1 and v2. This meansthatour calculationstofollow 
are not conditioned on v1 and v2 beingconnected. However, when v1 and v2 turn out to be connected, then 
this construction provides a path from v1 to v2. Once we know that F(A(Sk,.))occurs for some ., we can 
easilybound Dk bythefollowingstraightforward geometric lemma. Lemma 3.2. Let Q be a rectangle with side 
lengths s and as. Let w1 and w2 be two nodes of G contained in Q. If there exists a path between w1 and 
w2 entirely contained in Q, then dG(w1,w2). 11as2/r2 . Proof. The shortest path between w1 and w2 that 
is contained inside Q has the property that for any two ' non-consecutive nodes u and u in the path, 
their distance is larger than r. Otherwise, we can take the edge (u,u ' ) and make the path shorter. 
This means that if we draw a ball of radius r/2 around every other node of the path, then the balls will 
not overlap. Let m be the number of nodes in the path. There are m/2 non-overlapping balls of radius 
r/2. For each ball, at least 1/4 of its area is contained inside Q. Therefore, it must hold that Area(Q) 
32as2 m . 2= . p(r/2)2/4 pr2 The lemma below gives an upper bound for the proba­bility that A(Sk,.)does 
not have the crossings. Lemma 3.3. There exist constants c and .0 > 1 such that for all .>.0 and 1 . 
k . 2., it holds that Pr [F(A(Sk,.))]. 1-exp(-c.r). Proof. We build upon ideas from the proof [12, Lemma10.5]. 
Recall thedecomposition of A(Sk,.)into rectangles(refertoFigure2(b)) andtakethe top rect­angle Z1Z4Z5Z12. 
Itssideshavelengths(.-1)r/2 and 2.r/3. Therefore, the aspect ratio of the rectangle is 3(. -1)/(4.). 
3/4, which increases with .. We want to calculate the probability that such a rectangle has a horizontal 
crossing as . increases. This is slightly dif­ferent from the calculation in [12, Lemma 10.5], since 
there the aspect ratio is .xed and the side of the rect­angle is allowed to vary. But clearly, for any 
rectangle with side lengths(. -1)r/2 and 2.r/3, we can stretch the largest sides (while keeping the smallest 
sides un­changed) to make the aspect ratio be 3(.0 -1)/(4.0), which we can then .x. Also, if there is 
a horizontal crossinginthestretched rectangle,theremustbeahor­izontal crossing in the original one. Following 
along the lines of the proof [12, Lemma 10.5], we can then con­clude that there are constants .0 and 
c such that for all . . .0 a rectangle of side lengths (. - 1)r/2 and 2.r/3 has a horizontal crossing 
with probability larger than 1-e-c.r/4. Applying the union bound over the 4 rectangles composing A(Sk,.)concludes 
the proof.  Now we use this lemma to bound the length of a detour. For any k, let Gk be the smallest 
value of .>.0 for which F(A(Sk,.)) occurs. Suppose that Sk is empty and Sk-2 is not empty. We want to 
obtain an upper bound for Gk. Note that once we know the value of Gk, we can apply Lemma 3.2 to conclude 
that Dk . (22/3)G2 k. Since for each v1 and v2 there are at v most 2. = O( n )cells, Lemma 3.3 gives 
that there is a constant c1 such that withprobability 1-O(n-4)we obtain Dk . c1 log2 n/r2 for all k. 
Let E(v1,v2)be the event that Dk . c1 log2 n/r2 for a .xedpairof nodes v1 and v2, and all k. Thus, Pr 
[E(v1,v2)]. 1-O(n-4). .2. We want to apply Azuma s inequality to Dk k=3 under the condition that E(v1,v2) 
happens. Noting that E [Dk |E(v1,v2)] . E [Dk]/Pr [E(v1,v2)], we proceed to derive an upper bound for 
E [Dk]. The probability that Sk-2 is not empty and Sk is empty is -r -r e2/6(1-e2/6). Recall that Dk 
. (22/3)G2 k. There­ fore, Pr [Dk . l] . 1 - Pr F(A(Sk, (3/22)l)) . exp(-c (3/22)lr). We can then write 
-r -r/6) E [Dk]= e2/6(1 - e2.8 Pr [Dk . l] . l=1 2 8 -r/6 ePr [Dk . l]dl, where the last inequality fol­ 
0 lows from Pr [Dk . l] being a non-increasing function of l. Since we have an exponential upper bound 
for Pr [Dk . l]with l . (22/3).02, we obtain -r E [Dk].e 2/6(22/3).2 0 8 v -r/6 -c (3/22)l + e 2e rdl 
l=(22/3).2 0 =O(1). Using the linearity property of expecta­tions and Pr [E(v1,v2)] . 1 -O(n-4), we obtain 
E [dG(v1,v2) |E(v1,v2)] . E [dG(v1,v2)]/Pr [E(v1,v2)]= O(.)= O(.v1-v2.2/r). If the event E(v1,v2) holds, 
we have ' E [Dk |E(v1,v2)]= O(1) and Gk . c1 log n/r for all k ' and some constant c1, which yields Dk 
. c1 log2 n/r2 . ' Letting . =4c1 log n/r, this implies that for two cells Sk and Sk' such that |k-k 
' |. ., the annuli A(Sk,./4) and A(Sk' ,./4) do not intersect, and consequently, the random variables 
Dk and Dk' are independent. Now we split the random variables D1,D2,...,D2. into groups of independent 
random variables. De.ne the index set Ij = {k:3 . k . 2.,k = j (mod.)}. We ..-1 . can write dG(v1,v2)=

Giventwo nodes v1 and v2, let R(v1,v2) be the time it takes for the random broadcast algorithm started 
at v1 to inform v2 for the .rst time. We assume in the sequel that v1 and v2 belong to the largest connected 
component of G and show that provided .v1 - v2.2 = O(log4 n/r2), R(v1,v2)= O(.v1 -v2.2/r). Initially, 
we assume that v v r = O( log n ). The case r = .( log n )is simpler, but since it uses di.erent proof 
techniques, we deal with it in Section 4.1. v We start our treatment for the case r = O( log n ) with 
an easy lemma that shows that the time until a node informs a given neighbor is O(log2 n) with high probability. 
  Xi-1 Xi Figure 3: Illustration of the path considered to obtain R(v1 ,v2 ). The picture shows three 
consecutive nodes ui-1 , ui , and ui+1 of the path from v1 to v2 and the balls Xi-1 , Xi , and Xi+1 around

Proof. Note that if the degree of w1 in G is k, then the number of rounds until w1 sends the information 
to w2 is given by a geometric random variable with mean k. It is easy to check that there is a constant 
c5 such that withprobability1-O(n-3)all nodes of a random geometric graph have degree smaller than c5

nwe conclude that R(w1,w2) . 3c5 log2 n for all w1,w2 with probability 1-O(n-1). Before proceeding, note 
that the lemma above shows that R(v1,v2) can be upper bounded by O(dG(v1,v2)log2 n). We derive a much 
better bound in '' the sequel. Let r bede.nedsuchthat rc <r <r. Note ' that such an r exists since r>rc. 
For convenience, '' write r = r(1-2e). Since r >rc, G ' = G(Pn,r ' )con­tains a connected component of 
size O(n) with proba­ v -O( n ) bility 1-e. Note also that G ' is a subgraph of G. Our strategyto obtain 
an upperboundforR(v1,v2) is the following. First, we assume that v1 and v2 belong to the largest connected 
component of G ' . (We address the case where they do not belong to the largest connected component of 
G ' at the end of this section.) Then, we take a path in G ' from v1 to v2. Instead of calculating the 
time it takes for the random broadcast algorithm to transmit the information along thispath, whichgives 
a ratherpessimistic upperbound, we enlarge the path using that G ' is a subgraph of G and calculate the 
time it takes for the random broadcast algorithm to transmit the information along this enlargedpath. 
Let u1,u2,...,um be a path from v1 to v2 in G ' , where u1 = v1 and um = v2. For each i, we de.ne the 
region Xi . O in the following way. Set X1 to be the point where u1 is located and Xm to be the point 
where um is located; for 2 . i . m -1, de.ne Xi to be the ball with center at ui and radius er. Our goal 
is to get an upper bound for R(v1,v2)by following the path X1,X2,...,Xm (refer to Figure 3). De.ne the 
random variable T(Xi,Xi+1), 1 . i . m - 1, as the time the random broadcast algorithm takes to .rst inform 
a node in Xi+1 given that it started in a node chosen uniformly at random from Xi. Note ' that, for any 
two nodes w . Xi and w . Xi+1, the triangle inequality and the de.nition of Xi give .w - w ' .2 . 2er 
+ .ui - ui+1.2 . r. Therefore, w ' and w are neighbors in G. Moreover, for any i, once the random broadcast 
algorithm informs a node inside Xi, then the node that receives the information is a uniformly random 
node from Xi. Thus, we can clearly obtain the following upper bound m-1 R(v1,v2). T(Xi,Xi+1). i=1 Note 
that Lemma 4.1 gives T(Xm-1,Xm)= O(log2 n) withprobability1-O(n-1),for eachchoice of v1 and v2. The next 
lemma gives the expectation of T(Xi,Xi+1) for each 1 . i . m -2. Lemma 4.2. For any 1 . i . m - 2, it 
holds that E [T(Xi,Xi+1)]. 1/e2 . Proof. Let w be a node chosen uniformly at random from Xi. Assume w 
.. Xi+1 (otherwise, the broadcast time from w to Xi+1 is zero). Let Y be the number ' of neighbors of 
w and let Y be the number of nodes in Xi+1. Therefore, E [T(Xi,Xi+1)] = E [Y/Y ' ]. We ' know that Y 
. 1 and Y . 1, therefore, Y - 1 and Y ' -1 arePoisson random variables with mean pr2 and pe2r2, respectively. 
Conditional on Y -1= k, the value ' of Y -1 isgivenby aBinomialdistributionwith mean  kpe2 r pr22 = 
ke2 . We obtain E [T(Xi,Xi+1)] 8 k .. k+1 -pr2 (pr2)k k = e (e2)i(1-e2)k-i i+1 k! i k=0 i=0 8 1 -pr2

any two connected nodes v1 and v2 such that .v1 - v2.2 = O(log4 n/r2) (we come back to the case .v1 - 
v2.2 = o(log4 n/r2) at the end of this section), we know that there is a path like the ones derived in 
Section3fortheproofofTheorem2.3. Inparticular,we know that there is a path v1 = u1,u2,...,um-1,um = v2 
such that m = O( v n /r ' ) and, provided E(v1,v2) holds, the annuli A(Sk,Gk)and A(Sk' ,Gk' )are disjoint 
if |k-k ' |. .. Recall that the cells S1,S2,...,S2. have side lengths r/2 and r/3, therefore, we need 
to take 6 adjacent cells together to obtain a rectangle withlargest side length 2r. Recall also that 
only every other cell is adjacent. Then, for k and k ' such that |k-k ' |. .+12, the distance between 
any point in A(Sk,Gk) and any point in A(Sk' ,Gk' )is at least 2r. Each annulus has at most c1 log2 n/r2 
nodes in the path, therefore, letting . ' =(c1 log2 n/r2)(. +12) = O(log3 n/r3), we obtain that for any 
two nodes ui and uj in the path such that |i - j|. . ' , .ui - uj.2 . 2r and, consequently, T(Xi,Xi+1)and 
T(Xj,Xj+1)are independent. It is important to remark that the path has length v m = O( n /r ' ), for 
all v1 and v2. Conditional on the existence of this particular path, the Poisson point m process over 
O\{ui}, where the union is over the i=1 pointswherethenodesof thepath are located,remains m unchanged 
since {ui}spansaset of measure0inO. i=1 Let the index set Jj = {1 . i . m: i = j (mod. ' )}. We can write 
R(v1,v2)= O(log2 n)+ -1 .. ' T(Xi,Xi+1), where the .rst term comes j=0 i.Jj from the time it takes for 
the random broadcast algo­rithm to inform v2 once any neighbor of v2 is informed. For all j, the term 
T(Xi,Xi+1) is given by the i.Jj sum of independent geometric random variables. We apply the following 
Cherno. bound for Geometric ran­dom variables. Lemma 4.3. Let X1,...,Xn be independent geometric random 
variables, each having parameter p (and thus n mean 1/p), and let X = Then, for any e> 0, i=1 Xi. ne2

union bound over all j allows us to conclude that for all pairs of connected nodes v1 and v2 such that 
.v1 - v2.2 = O(log4 n/r2), there is a constant c6 for which .. . ' -1 -3 Pr . T(Xi,Xi+1). c6(m -2) .

component of G for which .v1 - v2.2 = O(log4 n/r2), we obtain R(v1,v2) =T(.v1 - v2.2/r). Note that there 
exist v v1,v2 . G for which .v1 - v2.2 = T( n ) and, v consequently, R(v1,v2)=T( n/r). Now we treat 
two remaining cases. First, since G ' is a subgraph of G, there may exist some nodes in the largest connected 
component of G that do not belong to the largest connected component of G ' . Nevertheless, it is a known 
fact from random geometric graphs [12, Theorem10.18]thatthesecondlargestcomponent of G ' contains O(log2 
n) nodes with probability 1 -O(n-1). Therefore, since R(w1,w2)= O(log2 n) for every pair of neighbors 
w1 and w2, we conclude that the time it takes to inform all the remaining nodes is O(log4 n), v which 
is negligible in comparison to T( n/r). The second case corresponds to the nodes that are within distance 
o(log4 n/r2) to the initially informed node, which is denoted here as v1. Take Q to be a square centered 
at v1 with side length c7 log4 /r2, for some constant c7 (the orientation ofQdoes notmatter). Note that 
Q contains all nodes within distance o(log4 n/r2) of v1. Now, take Q ' to be a square centered at v1, 
with the same orientation as Q, but with sides having twice the length of the sides of Q. Clearly, Q 
' \ Q is an annulus centered at v1 and Lemma 3.3 can be used to show that F(Q ' \ Q) holds with probability 
 -O(log4 n/r2) 1 - e. Thus, all nodes within distance o(log4 n/r2)are contained inside the crossings 
of Q ' \Q and their distance to v1 in G must be smaller than 2 44c7 log8 n/r6 by Lemma 3.2. So using 
Lemma 4.1 we conclude that all nodes within distance o(log4 n/r2)to v1 are informed after O(log10 n/r6)rounds, 
whichis also v negligible in comparison to T( n/r). v 4.1 Case r = .( log n ). In this section we prove 
the following lemma, which deals with the case r = v .( log n ). v Lemma 4.4. If r = .( log n ), then 
for all node s . G, v we obtain R(s,G)= O( n/r+ logn) with probability 1-O(n-1). Remark 1. We point 
out that Lemma 4.4 can be gen­eralized to RGGs in higher dimensions. For dimen­sion d . 2, the lemma 
holds with O =[0,n1/d]d and r = .(log1/d n) as long as d is a constant independent from n. In order to 
prove Lemma 4.4, we consider a tessel­ v lationofO intosquaresof side-length min {r/3, n/2}, v which 
we refer to as cells. (If n is not a multiple of r/3, then we make the cells in the last row or column 
of the tessellation be smaller than the others.) It is very easy to verify that nodes in the same cell 
are neigh­bors in G and that a node in a given cell can only have neighbors in 49 di.erent cells. Let 
amin be the number of nodes inside the cell that contains the smallest num­ber ofnodes, andlet amax be 
the number ofnodes inside the cell that contains the largest number of nodes. Since v r = .( log n ), 
a standard Cherno. bound for Pois­son random variables can be used to show that there are constants c1 
<c2 such that a .xed cell contains at least c1r2 nodes and at most c2r2 nodes with probabil­ -2 itylargerthan1 
-n. Using the union bound over the cells of the tessellation, we obtain that amin and amax are T(r2)with 
probability 1-O(n-1). We are now in position to start our proof for Lemma 4.4. We index the cells by 
i . Z2 and let Zi be the event that the cell i contains at least one informed node. We say that cells 
i and jare adjacent if and only if they share an edge. Therefore, each cell has exactly 4 adjacent cells 
and this adjacency relation induces a 4-regulargraph C over the cells. Given two adjacent cells i and 
j, at any round of the random broadcast algorithm, an informed node in cell i chooses a node from cell 
j with probability larger than amin/(49amax) = T(1). We want to derive the time until Zi = 1 for all 
i. Given a path between two cells j1,j2 . C, the number of rounds the information takes to be transmitted 
along this path can be upper bounded by the sum of independent Geometric random variables with mean T(1). 
Applying Lemma 4.3, we infer that the number of rounds requiredto transmit the information from j1 to 
j2 is smaller than O(diam(C)+ -O(diam(C)+logn) log n) with probability 1 - e. Since v there are O(n/r2) 
cells and diam(C)= O( n /r), we obtain that with probability 1-O(n-1),Zi =1 for all v i after O( n/r+ 
logn)rounds. Now, we consider a faulty version of the random broadcast algorithm, which proceeds as explained 
in Section 2 but when an informed node is about to trans­mit the information to a neighbor chosen independently 
and uniformly at random, this transmission fails with probabilityp. [0,1)independentlyfromallothertrans­missions. 
Moreover, a node that was not informed at the beginning of the algorithm can only get informed if it 
receives the information from a transmission that did not fail. We denote by Rp(s,G)the runtime of the 
faulty version of the random broadcast algorithm ini­tiated at node s . G. We use the following relation 
between R(s,G)and Rp(s,G). Lemma 4.5. ([7, Theorem 6]) For any graph G, any node s . G, and any p . [0,1), 
there exists a coupling between Rp(s,G)and R(s,G) such that R(s,G) Rp(s,G)= O . 1-p Assume thateach cell 
contains at least one informed node. We want to obtain how many additional rounds are required until 
all nodes in G become informed. Note that each cell constitutes a clique with T(r2) nodes. According 
to the random broadcast algorithm, at any round, a node chooses a neighbor inside its own cell with probability 
larger than amin/(49amax) = T(1). Therefore, a standardcoupling argument canbe used to show that the 
time until all nodes from a given cell get informed can be upper bounded by the time the faulty version 
of the random broadcast algorithm with failure probabilityT(1)takesto informallnodesof acomplete graph 
with T(r2) nodes. Thus, from [8, Theorem 4.1] and Lemma 4.5, we obtain that all nodes of a given cellget 
informed within O(logr2)steps withprobability 1-O(r-2). Now we need to extend this result to all cells. 
For each cell i, let Wi bean independentGeometricrandom variable with parameter . (and thus mean 1/.), 
where we assume . =1 -O(r-2). Therefore, once Zi =1 for all cell i, then the time it takes until all 
nodes get informed can be upper bounded by O(logr2)maxi Wi, where the maximum is taken over all cells. 
Since we have T(n/r2)cells, we obtain that all Wi s are smaller than clog(n/r2) for some constant c with 
probability  (1-(1-.)c log(n/r2))T(n/r2) . 1-O(n-1)for a proper choice of c. Therefore, we obtain that 
R(s,G) . v O(diam(C)+ logn + log(r2)log(n/r2)) = O( n /r+ log n), whichconcludes the proof of Lemma 4.4. 
5 Conclusion We have analyzed the performance of the random broadcast algorithm in random geometric graphs. 
We proved that with probability 1-O(n-1)the algorithm v .nishes within O( n/r) steps, where r can be 
an arbitrary value above the critical coverage radius for the emergence of a connected component with 
O(n) nodes. We also showedthatfor anytwo nodes v1 and v2 such that .v1 -v2.2 = O(log3 n/r2), the length 
of the shortest path between them in the random geometric graph is O(.v1 - v2.2/r). In particular, this 
implies that the diameter of the largest connected component v is O( n/r). A challenging open problem 
is to extend our re­sultsto randomgeometricgraphs inhigherdimensions, since our proof takes advantage 
of some restrictions imposed by the geometry in two dimensions. In an­other direction, our techniques 
may be useful to an­alyze other problems like the cover time of the largest connected component ofRGGs. 
This would nicely com­plement recent results by Cooper and Frieze [2, 3] for connected RGGs and for the 
largest connected compo­nent ofErd.os-R´enyi randomgraphs. Acknowledgments MilanBradonji´c wouldthankLosAlamosNationalLab­oratory.
