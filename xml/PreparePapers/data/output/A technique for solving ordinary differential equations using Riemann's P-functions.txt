Department of Mathematics, Tsuda College Kodaira-shi Tokyo Japan Abstract This paper presents an algorithmic 
approach to symbolic solution of 2nd order linear ODEs. The al- gorithm consists of two parts. The first 
part invol- ves conlolete algorithms for hypergeometric equations and hypergeometric equations of confluent 
type. These algorithms are based on Riemann's P-functions and Hukuhara's P-functions respectively. Another 
part involves an algorithm for transforming a given equation to a hypergeometric equation or a hyper- 
geometric equation of confluent type. The transforma tion is ~xgssible if a given equation satisfies 
cer- tain conditions, otherwise it works only as one of heuristic methods. However our method can solve 
many equations which seam to be very difficult to solve by conventional methods. 1. Introduction We 
consider in this paper the following 2nd order linear ODE with rational function coeffici- ents, ~1.1) 
y" + F(x)y' + G(x)y= H(x). As is well-known, the general solution of (I .I) is the sum of the special 
solution of (1. I ) and the general solution of the correspanding homogeneous equation, (1.2) y" + 
F(x)y' + G(x)y = 0 We will confine ourselves to only (1.2) in this Permission to copy without fee all

$00.75 paper. The class of ODEs we are considering covers many equations which appe~ in mathematical 
physic- s. Therefore, although we consider very restricted class of functions mathe~Patically, our work 
will have a gocx~ significance practically. We have, at present, no general method for solving (I .2). 
However, for several subclasses of (I .2), mathematicians gave the solutions. One such subclass is the 
class of hypergeometric equations : (1.3) y,,+ ax+b cx 2 +dx+e (x-el) (x'~xz) y'+ (x-%) 2 (X-e2)2 y 
= 0, and another such subclass is the class of hyper- geQmetric equations (h.g.e.s) of confluent type: 
ax+b cx 2 +dx+e (1.4) y"+ --y'+ Y = 0 x- ~ (x-~) 2 The equation in these two subclasses has a remark- 
able property that the general solution is cc~p- letely characterized by a finite number of parame- ters 
of several icxzal solutions. This remarkable property is found only in the above two subclasses at present. 
The general solution represented by a few local parameters is called Rismann's P-func- tion or the P-function 
of confluent type. The solutions of some h.g.e.s are represent- able in algebraic functions, and the 
condition for this was discovered in 1872 by H.A.Schwarz. In 1941-52, Hukuhara investigated the transformation 
rules of P-functions and discovered the conditions for that the solution of h.g.e, was representable 
in elementary functions. Our algorithm for obtain- ing the representation for the P-function explicit- 
ly is derived by the researches of Hukuhara. Hukuhara already found a method of solving Proceedings 
of the 1981 ACM Symposium 36 A Technique for Solving Ordinary Differential on Symbolic and Algebraic 
Computation Equations Using Riemann's P-functions &#38; (1.2) by transforming the equation to either 
(1.3) or (I .4). This transformation was done by removing the apparent singular points. HIS method has, 
how- ever, a defect that the resDval of an apparent sin- gular point often causes an appearance of other 
 singular points. In 1970, Ki~/ra discovered a method of trans- forming a Fuchs type DE to a h.g.e, 
which has seve- ral apparent singular points except for singular points at 0, I, and infinity. Kimura's 
method seems to be extended to the h.g.e, of confluent type. This paper describes the methods of Fuchs, 
Gauss, Ri~nann, Hukuhara, Kin~/ra, et.al, for solv- ing the equation (I .2) and the implementation of 
their methods into REDUCE 2. 2. P-functions and Apparent Singular Points The solution of ODE (I .2) 
is characterized much by the number and the rank of the singular points of the equation. Because (I .2) 
is linear in y, the singular points of the solution y coincide with those of the coefficients of the 
equation, namely with the zero points of the denominators of F and G. The singularity at infinity is 
defined by the singularity at t=0 with the transformation t=I/x. The simplest singular points are called 
regular singular points. The rank of the singula- rity of (I .2) at infinity is the maximum of f and 
g/2 plus one, where f is the degree of F and g is the degree of G. If the rank is less than or equal 
to zero, infinity is a regular singular point. If x=~ is a pole of F as well as G, and if the order of 
the pole is at most one for F and at most two for G, then x=e is a regular singular point of (I.2). 
This is ell-known Fuchs' theorem. Accord- ing to these definitions, all the singular points of (1.3), 
i.e. ~i, e2, and infinity are regular singular points. Furthermore, in (1.4), x=e is a regular singular 
point and infinity is an irregular singular point of rank one. At each regular singular point x=a, (1.2) 
has two independent power series solutions of the form (2.1a) Y1=(x-e)11{ go + g,(x-e)1+... }, go # 
0 , (2.Ib) y 2= (x-e) 12 {ho+hi (x-e) i +... }+coy110g (x-e), where h0~0, and 11 and 12 are two solutions 
of the characteristic equation of (I .2) at x=~, (2.2) { l(X-1)+F1(e)X+G*(e)=0' F l (x) = (x-e) F(x), 
G I (x) =(x-e) 2G(x) . The 11 and 12 are called exponents of (I .2) at e . Equation (I .3) has six exponents 
11, 12, ~i, ~2, and ~i,~)2 at el ' e2' and infinity respectively. There exists a connection among them, 
which is known as Fuchs' relation, (2.3) 11 +12 +~l +~2 +~* +~2 = I. Conversely, for given values of 
I,, 12, ~i, ~2, and ~I, 92 satisfying the relation (2.3), there is only one equation of the form (I .3) 
having the same exponents. The general solution of this equation is written as (2.4) y = P I, ~, ul 
x , t2 ~2 v2 and it is called Riemann's P-function. We must note here that Riemann's P-function is not 
a func- tion but a class of functions which satisfy (I .3). The general solution of (I .3) is characterized 
by only values of parameters in the braces of (2.4). Similarly, we can construct P-functions for (I 
.4). Using the following linear fractional transformation with respect to the independent variables, 
 (2.5) t = (Ax+B)/(Cx+D), AD-BC #0, we can transform (I .4) to its standard form ax+b cx 2 +dx+e (2.6) 
y" +--y' + y = 0. x x 2 The characteristic equation at x=0 is (2.7) o(~-1)+bo+ e = 0, whose two roots 
o, and o2 give the exponents of (2.6) at x=0. When a2~4c in (2.6), (2.6) has two independent solutions 
at infinity. The solutions have the following form known as asymptotic expan- sions: _2 (2.8) Yi=e 
fix x-~i{cj 0+ci,x-l+ci2x + .. },ci0~0 , where I i and ~i are defined by (2.9) 1'21 +ali+b=0' ~i=(bli 
+d)/(21i+a) , i=1,2. There is a relation connecting the values o1, 02, ~l, and ~2 which is similar to 
Fuchs' relation, 37 A Technique for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations Using Riemann "s P-functions 
and known as Hukuhara's relation: (2.10) o,+o2+p,+p2 = I. Conversely, for given values of oi, o2, p,, 
and P2 satisfying the relation (2.10), there is only one equation of the form (2.6) that has o~ and o2 
as two exponents at x=0 and has two independent solu- tions of the form (2.8) at infinity. The general 
solution in this case is written as (2.11) y = p 1, pl Ol x , 12 ]12 02 and it is called Hu.kuh&#38;ra's 
P-function. We must note here that Hukuhara's P-function is not a func- tion but a class of functions 
which satisfy (2.6). The general solution of (2.6) is characterized by only values of parameters in the 
braces of (2.11). When a2=4c in (2.6), the equation has two in- dependent solutions at infinity. The 
solutions have the following form known as asyn~ptotic expan- sions: (2.12) yi = e Ix+Sit t {ci0+ci16*+.. 
} ,ci0~0, i=1,2, where t, 1, and 8i are defined by 2 2 (2.13) t=/~, ~ +al+b=0, 8i + 4(d+bl)=0, i=1,2. 
Conversely, for given values of 0,, o 2 , I , and 8(= 18ii) satisfying (2.13), there is only one equation 
of the form (2.6) which has o, and 02 as two exponents at x=0, and has two asymptotic exp=~- sions (2.12) 
at infinity. The general solution in this case is written as (2.14) y = P 1 8 O, x , I -8 O2 and it 
is called Hukuhara's P-function. When x=e is a regular singular point, we can rewrite (1.2) as follows 
 (2.15) (x-e)Zy '' + (x-u)F,(x) y' + G,(x)y = 0, where F,(x) and G,(x) have no singular point at x=e. 
At a regular singular point ~, we can calcu- late the ~xDwer series solutions by substituting y in (2.15) 
by (x-c~) I {g0+g,(x-e) *+...+gm(x-u)m+...}. It follows that the coefficients gm must satisfy the following 
conditions (2.16) gmf 0 (l+m) +gm_, f, ( I+m-I ) +...+g 0fm(1) =0, where m=0,I,2,.., and fi is defined 
by 1 ,8~ (2.17) f£(1)=-~ ~ { 1(1-1)+F, (x)14G, (x)}Ix__ u , £=0,1,2,... , and i is the solution of 
the characteristic equa- tion f0(1)=0 at x=~. Let I,-12, with 11 and 12 roots of f0 (I)=0, be a positive 
integer k. If f0 (i+m)~0, gm is determined uniquely by (2.16). When f0 (l+k)=0, which happens for the 
case I=12 and 1+k=l, , for example, gk cannot be calculated un- less the following condition is satisfied, 
 (2.18) gk_, f, (I-k+I) +...eg0fk (I) =0. The e is called an apparent singular point of (2.15) if (2.18) 
is satisfied. In other words, if i,-12 is a positive integer and c0=0 in the solution (2.1), then e 
is an apparent singular point. 3. Riemann' s P-functions We can determine whether or not a given Rie- 
mann's P-function (2.4) has an explicit expression by investigating the so-called Rie~ann's indices 
which are three differences of characteristic roots at the singular ~x~ints e,, e z , and infinity (3.1) 
( i, p, ~ ). Here, the sign and the order of the differences are unessential. Let the points e,, e2, 
and infinity be transformed to 8,, 82, and 83 respec- tively, by the transformation (2.5). Then we have 
 (3.2) P X, pl , = P I, p, ~, t , t=~ . 12 ~z v2 t2 1J.2 ~2 The definition of P-function gives us 
(3.3) (x-c~1~ (x-c~2)qY=P X,+p ~Ji+q ~),-p-q x , 12+p p2+q ~2-P-q where y is the P-function in the left 
hand side of (3.2). Setting the values p and q to -12 and -P2 respectively in (3.3), we get (3.4) (x-~,) 
(x-u 2) y=P 1 P ~+~ x , 0 0 where y is the P-function in the left hand side of (3.2) and I = 1,-1 z, 
~ =p,-Pz, ~= ui-~2, and ~=92-12-i~2. When ~, {+9~0,-I,-2,...,-(n-1), with n a ix3sitive integer, we 
have the following diffe- rantiation fomula for the Riemann's P-function in the right hand side of (3.4):

such that p =>q >r and p~q+r= an even integer. Then, for two Riemann's P-functions Y=P ~ 9+~ , z=P 
I' IJ' U '+~ '; X , 0 { 0 0 we have the following relation ~-m-r-n r -~+r+m - {-r  136) e x L(xl) {x 
 r (x~y) } ] , D t where t=l/x, .raP(p-N-r)/2, n=(p-q+r)/2, Dn= dn/dx n, x and D t r = dr/dt r. Here, 
the following conditions are assumed to make the differentiation possible: {~, ~+1 @ 0,-I,-2 .... ,-(r-l), 
(3.7) {+r,~+u ~ 0,-I,-2,...,-(m-I), ~+p, {+~+u # 0,-I ,-2,... ,-(n-l). The proof is straightforward 
under the conditions (3.7). If one of the conditions (3.7) is not satis- fied, which is the case for 
~=-k, 0 __<k =<r-1, for example, then ~y can be expressed by el~nentary functions. Now we investigate 
the conditions for that the DE can be solved by the integration, which is defined as follows. Definition. 
A h.g.e. (I .3) is said to be solvable if and only if the equation is transformed to (3.8) z" +H(x) 
z' = 0 , after a finite n~ber of the following transforma- tions (3.9) z=(x-a)PY, ( ~= ~i, a2, or 0 
), and z=y'. Theorem. The h.g.e. (1.3) or corresponding Riemann's P-function (2.4) is solvable if and 
only if one of four values itp_+9 is an odd integer, where I = 11- 12, ~= ~i- ~2, and 9 = 91- 92. For 
exaniole, in the case l+p+~ ~2m+I, m __>I, we have (3.10) y=P 11 V, = (X-~,)X2(X-~2) ~z t2 1J2 9z (x-a,)

1872, H.A.Schwarz published a paper giving criteria on whether or not the general solution of a h.g.e, 
is algebraic, and the criteria were made into a table in terms of Riemann's indices, known as Schwarz' 
table. Later in 1949, Hukuhara and Ohashi published a paper written in Japanese giving criteria on whether 
or not the general solution of a h.g.e, can be expressed in elementary functions, allowing transformations 
of independent variable of the form t=x r, r=I,2, and t=(Ax+B)/(Cx+D), AD-BC~0, as well as the transformation 
of dependent variable of the form z=(x-c~)Py and z=y'. The criteria were also made into a table in terms 
of Rie~ann's indi- ces. The following table summarizes the results of Hukuhara and Ohashi (type 0, type 
I,..., and type 5) and those of Schwarz (type I with r a rational nt~n- ber, type 2, ..., and type 15).

"s P-functions In 1952, Hukuhara and Ohashi published anon ther paper written in Japanese describing 
an integ- ration method for equations of type 0,..., and type 5. The integration method for equations 
of type 0 has already shown in (3.10). For equations of type I,..., and type 5, we explain only equa- 
tions of type I to save the paper. For the case k=m=0, the Riemann's P-function is expressed explicitly 
as  (3.15) 0 r/2 x = A(V~+~)r+B(/x-~J1) r. I/2 I/2-r/2 The general case of equations type I can be 
reduced to the above case by Hukuhara's theorem (3.6). The integration methods for the equations of 
other types are quite similar to that of type I. 4. Hukuhara's P-functions In 1941, Hukuhara introduced 
P-functions for h.g.e.s of confluent type as was mentioned in §2. He obtained many theorems and formulas 
similar to those of Riemann's P-functions. Let us apply the transformations of independent variables 
 (4.1) x+e=t, and x=~t, to (2.6). Then we get  (4.2) P Ii ~x oi = P I, Pl oi , x+e=t, [~2 P2 02 tz 
P2 02 (4.31 Nilx Ul o1 x = P 611 PX Ox , x=6t. Ltz u2 o2 L61z u2 o2 Simiarly we get the following relation 
by the transformation z=elXxOy: (4.4) elXx ° P 11 Px ox P i+I p,-o oi+o L12 ~2 o2 L12+1 p2-o o2+o ) 
 Setting t2+ ~ and 02+ 0 to zero in (4.4), we get :. (4.5) e-12Xx-°2P O1 = P I pi+02 0 , L121J2 o2 LO 
~2"~2 0 where t=I~.-12 and o=oi-o2. When I,(p2+k)~0,1,2,.. ,n-1, with n a Ix3sitive integer. We get 
the follow- ing differentiation formula for the P-function in right hand side of (4.5): dn (4.6) P~Ix 
p, oI P~I, p, ox-n x .  --[0 P2 0 [0 p2+n 0 Relations (4.5) and (4.6) lead us to the following theorem 
which gives the condition for that one P-function is transformed to another P-function. Theorem (Hukuhara). 
Let y and z be the following P-functions: fT,_. o f  "k12 p, o2 Li'2 where we assume that I,-12 = 
I' I' ,- 2 and both p and q defined by ! ! I I (4.8) p = ~z-p1+oz-Ox, q = p2-px+o,-ax, are integers. 
Then, if integers m, m', n, and n' satisfy the relations n'-n=p and m'-m=q, y and z are related to each 
other as I 'x ' (4.9) z=e 2 xOI D m' {elX D n' {x-O+m+n Dm{e-lX Dn{e-12 x x-O2y}}}} , where I=11-12, 
o =oi-o2, and D=d/dx. This theorem is easily proved by the straight sub- stitution. Note that the condition 
1x-12=I]-I~ is unessential, because the transformation x=6t breaks the condition (cf. (4.3)). Note 
further that, in some cases, the diffe- rentiation is impossible in (4.9), for example, when p2+02 = 
1-k or equivalently p1+ 01 = k. In such a case, y is representable in elementary functions. Let us show 
this for the case ~2+ 02 = l-k; 0 } (4.10) y = Pill Pl ox x L12 ~J2 02 =e I*x x°XD k {A+B le (12-11)x 
x°2-°1+k-1dx }. 5. Methods for Removin@ Apparent Singular Points A simple method for removing of apparent 
singu- lar [x3ints was known to mathematicians before 1941. If x=e is an apparent singular Ix)int of 
(1.2), we have two power series solutions at x=~ : I yx= (x-e) 1+k {go + gl(x-u)*+... }, g0~0, (5.1) 
I x y2= (x-~) {h0+ h,(x-ct) +... }, h0~0,  40 A Technique for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations 
Using Riemann's P-functions where k is a positive integer. For the particular case that k=1 and I=0 in 
(5.1), then x~ is a regu- lar point as is well-known. By making the trans- formation y=(x-e)Xz in (1.2), 
we obtain an equation which has the following two solutions at x=~, (5.2) ~ z1=(x-ct)k {go+ g1(x'~)l+"'}' 
g0# 0, [z2=(x-ct) ° {h0+ hz(x-c0i+...}, h0# 0, hz~ 0. Therefore, if k=1 in (5.2), then x--~ is a regular 
point of the equation. When k__>2, the transformae tion w=z' gives the following two solutions, { w1=(x-ct) 
k-1 {go + gt (x-e) i (5.3) +''" }' got 0, w2=(x-~) £-I {h0+ h1(x-~)z+... }, hot 0. We, thus reach again 
at the start solutions (5.1), and the repetition of this process removes the sin- gular point. The above 
method is summarized in the transformations of the forms (5.4) z=(x-~)Xy, or z=y'. The latter transformation 
may cause, however, new singular points. This is a defect of the above method. When all the singuar 
points are regular, the equation is said to be of Fuchs' type. As is well- known, if t~D equations of 
Fuchs' type (5.5) y" + Al(x) y' + A2(x) y = 0 and (5.6) z" + Bl(X) z' + B2(x ) z = 0 have the same 
set of singular points and the same monodromy group, there are rational functions R0(x) and Rl(x) such 
that (5.5) is transformed from  (5.6) by  (5.7) y = R0(x ) z + R1(x) z' In 1970, Kinmra found that, 
for equations in proper subclasses of (5.5) and (5.6), their monodromy groups coincide. He showed that 
R 0 (x) and R, (x) are polynomials and can be calculated by the method of undete~nined coefficients in 
that case. Theorem (Kimura). Consider the equation 6 k ~i c~sxk+p t ~-I+..  (5.8) y.,+{Tx + ~x-1 +i 
X(x-i) ~(x-ai) y=0, [1~ai }y'+ i=I  which has regular singular points 0,1,a I ,...,a k, and infinity. 
Note that we can assume, without loss of generality,all of e i are negative integers. Assume that the 
singular points a,,..., and a k are apparent, and (5.8) is irreducible. Then if e-8 # 1,2,...,n-1, 
with n=-(ez+...+ ek) , (5.8) is obtained from (5.9) Z" + { X ~ + ~-} Z' + 0~(13+n) x(x-1) z = 0 , by 
a transformation of the form (5.10) y=( xn+plxn-1+...+pn ) z+x(x-1 ) (xn-1+q2xn-2  +...-~.n)Z' . 6. 
Algorithm for Solving Linear ODEs FrEml the results described above, we get an integration method for 
(1.2). First, we judge whe- ther or not a regular singular point is apparent by calculating finite coefficients 
of the power series solution at that point. The classification of all the singular points allows us to 
decide the type of the equation. If the equation has the form (5.8), we apply the transformation (5.10) 
to obtain an equation of the standard form (1.3). Then, we apply the integ- ration methods described 
in section 3 for the equation. If the given equation is of the type other than that of (5.8), we try 
to remove their apparent singular points by successive application of the transformation (5.4), and we 
try to integ- rate the reduced equation. 7. Examples We have implemented the above algorithm into REDUCE 
2 and tested our program on some fifty linear ODEs of the form (1.2). We will show only four examples 
with intermediate calculations. Example I.  (7.1) y" + 2x(x2-5) y' + 16(x~+I) y = 0. X4_1 (x~_1) 2 
The singular ~x~ints of this equation are 1, -I, i, -i, and infinity. All of the singular points of 
this equation are regular. Putting the power series solution at x=1 as Y = (x-1)l{go + g1(x-1)l+-.-} 
, go# 0, we obtain the following conditions on I, go ,gl,..., gof0(l)=0, glf0(l+l)+g0f1(l)=0,...,  
where f0(1)=(l-1)(I-2), fl(1)=2(l-1). For the value I=1 the conditions are satisfied, therefore x=l is 
an apparent singular point. The transfor- mation y=(x-1)z transforms the equation (7.1) to 41 A Technique

power series solution of (7.2) at x=-1 as 1  z = (x+l) X {go + gz(x+1) +... }, go% 0, we obtain the 
following conditions on X ,go,gz,.,., gofo(X)=0, gzfo(X+1)~g0fz(X)=0,..., where f0 (X)=(I-1) (X-2), 
fz (X)=-3(X-1). FOr the value X=I the conditions are satisfied for arbit- rary go and gz, therefore x= 
-I is an apparent sin- gular point. The transformation z=(x+1)w trans- forms the equation (7.2) to 2 
 (7.3) ~f, + 6__~_. w' + 2(3x +7) w = 0. x2+1 (x2+1)2 The singular points of (7.3) are i, -i, and infini- 
ty, and all these are regular. Therefore the gene- ral solution of (7.3) can be written as (7.4) w = 
P -l+vr~ -I-v'3 3 x . The indices of (7.4) are (2vr~, -2/~, I), and the type of the P-functlon in (7.4) 
is 0. Therefore it has the following explicit expression (7.5) w=(x+i)-l+v~(x-i)-l-ve/{A+BI(x-i)-2/3"(x+i) 
2/~- dx}. Consequently the general solution of (7.1) is given explicitly as (7.6) y = (x=-1)w. Example 
2. 2 2 2 2 (7.7) y" x + n y, + x - n x(x2 - n2 ) x2 y = 0 . The singular points of (7.7) are 0, n, 
-n, and infinity. The first three are regular singular points, and infinity is an irregular singular 
point of rank one. The characteristic equations of (.7.7) 2 2 at 0 and n are l-n = 0 and l(X-2) = 0, 
respec- tively. Putting the power series solutcLon of (7.7) atx=n as y = (x-n)n{ go + gz(x-n) z + gin(x-n{ 
+...}, got0, we obtain the following c~nditions on X, go,--., (7.8) gmf o (X+m) +gin_ zf z (X+m-1) +.

3) . For the value X=0 condi- tions (7.8) are satisfied, therefore x=n is an apparent singular ~x~int. 
We get the two solutions: Yz (x-n)2{ h0+ hz(x-n)Z+... }, h0# 0, 2 3+... e y2= (x-n)°{go+ ~n go(x-n) 
} go# 0.  By differentiating these functions, we obtain I ~= (x-n)1{2ho + 3hz(x-n) 1+... }, ho# 0, 
Y~= (x-n)2{n2-- go+...}, go# 0 .  The transformation y'=(x-n)z transforms the equa- tion (7.7) to (7.9) 
z" + x+3n z' + Ix-n) [Ix+n)'-n} z = 0 . x (x+n) X 2 (x+n) 2 The singular points of (7.9) are 0, -n, 
and infini- ty. The first two are regular singular points, and infinity is an irregular singular point 
of rank one. The characteristic equations at 0 and -n are (X+1)Z-n 2= 0 and (X-l)(X-2) = 0, respective- 
ly. The power series solution of (7.9) at x=-n, z = (x+n)X{ go + gz(x+n) t+... }, go# 0, must satisfy 
the following conditions, gof0 (X)=0, gzfo (l+l)+gofz (X) =0,..., where f0(X)=(X-1)(X-2), f,(l)=-3X(X-1)/n. 
For the value X =I the conditions are satisfied, therefore x=-n is an apparent singular point. The transfor- 
mation z=(x+n)w transforrps the equation (7.9) to (7.10) xZ~f' + 3x w' + (x2+1-n =) w = 0 . The general 
solutzon of (7.10) can be written, by the relations (2.6), (2.7), (2.9), and (2.11), as follows (7.11) 
w=P~ i 3/2 n-1 X=~'P I i 1/2 n =~B~X) , t-i 3/2 ~-1 L-i I/2 -n j where Bn(X) is the general solution 
of Bessel's equation of order n : (7.12) x2y " + x y' + (x 2- n 2) y = 0 . From the above sequence 
of transformations, and using simple calculaticc~s, we get the explicit expression of the general solution 
of (7.7) as d  (7.13) y = ~ Bn(X) . Exa~le 3.  (7.14) y,, + 2x+I y, + 64x~+ 1 y = 0. x(x-1 ) 4x 2

singular points of:this equation are 0, I, and infinity. The first two are regular singular points, and 
infinity is an irregular singular point of rank one. Putting the ~wer series solution of (7.14) at x=0 
as Y = ~ {go + g, x1+-.. }, go# 0 , we obtain the following conditions on l, go, g,,.., g0f0 (1)=0, 
glf0(1+1)+ g0f, (i)=0,...,  where f0(l) =12-41, f1(x) = X- 6 I-. For the value X = _ I the conditions 
are not satisfied, hence x=0 is 2 not the apparent singular point. The characteris- tic equation at 
x=1 is 412-161-65=0. The differen- ce of ted characteristic rcots is 9. The ~wer series solution of (7.14) 
at x=1 must satisfy (7.8) 63 On 1,g0,.., where f0(I)=12-41 -, f,(l)=1 - ~, f2(I)=-I - ~, f,(I)=I +I, 
f4(I)= -I - ~, fs(1)=  i + ~ f~(~)---1 -¼, f,(I)=I +2, f~(I)=-I 9 fs(X)=X + ~ . For the values go=1 
and I=- ~, we can calculate go, gz,..-, and g8 as follows: g0=1, gi=-17/4, g2=9, g3=-3595/288, g~=70297/5760, 
gs=-18991/2560, g6=-74467/41472, g7 =211505672/I 1612160, g8 =-79283484/1146880 .  These values do not 
satisfy the condition gsfz (I+8) +gTf2 (I+7)+...+ g0f9 (1)=0, therefore x=1 is not the apparent singular 
point. From the reasoning mentioned above, we can conclude that the general solution of (7.14) has no 
explicit expression. Example 4. y,,+{1 ~ 3 I I  (7.15) x x-1 x-~ }Y'+ 1 Y = 0  (x-l) (x- 7) 1 The 
singular point of this equation are 0, 1, ~, and infinity. The singular points 0, 1 ,and infini- ty are 
regular and ¼ is apparent. Equation (7.15) is obtained from 1 I 2  (7.16) z., +{~+~}z' +x(~_l) Z = 0, 
 by the following transformation (7.17) y = (x+ ½ )z + x(x-1)z' . Equation (7.16) has the general solution 
represen- table in elementary functions:   P{°°x} (7.18) z = 0 0 1 = (x-1)-I{A+B (x-1)dx}. 0-2 2 
8. Conclusion We have described in this paper an algorithmic integration method for the equations belonged 
to a few subclasses of the class of the Eq. (I .2). Also we have shown that for the other class of 
Eq. (1.2), only the heuristic algorithm is possible. The num- ber of the s~lbclasses whlch may be integrated 
by an algorithmic method have increased in the past, and also will increase in the future by the efforts 
of many people. However, even now, it must be valu- able to implement the algorithm on some proper 
 symbolic computation systE~ns. 9. References (I) BIEBERBAC~,L., Theorie der gewOhnlichen Differentialgleichungen,
