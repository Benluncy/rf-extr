Wagner SysTech Software Solutions P.O. BOX 413 Annandale, VA 22003, U.S.A. ABSTRACT We describe a graphical, 
interactive technique for modeling bivariate simulation input processes using a distribution family based 
on B6zier curves and sur­faces. This family has an open-ended parametrizat­ion and is capable of accurately 
representing an un­limited variety of shapes for marginal distributions to­gether with many common types 
of bivariate stochas­tic dependence. Our input-modeling technique is im­plemented in a Windows-based 
software system called PRIME Probabilistic Input Modeling Environment,. Several examples illustrate the 
application of PRIME to subjective and data-driven estimation of bivariate distributions representing 
simulation inputs. INTRODUCTION One of the central problems in the design and con­struction of large-scale 
stochastic simulation exper­iments is the selection of valid input models-that is, probability distributions 
that accurately mimic the behavior of the random input processes driving the system. In many applications, 
it is critical not only to capture the shape of the marginal distribu­tion of each major input random 
variable but also to represent accurately the stochastic dependencies between those variates (Lewis and 
Orav 1989). Al­though many practitioners appreciate the need for valid models of multivariate simulation 
inputs, they lack effective tools for building such input models. For many simulation experiments in 
}vhich stochas­tic dependencies between input variates are explicitly modeled, ad hoc methods must be 
usecl to incorpo­rate those features into the experiment,; for example, see Veeramani, Barash, and Wilson 
( 1991). In this paper we extend the uuivariate input­modeling methodology of Wagner and Wilson ( 1993) 
to handle continuous bivaria.te populations, and we present a flexible, interactive, graphical technique 
for James R. Wilson Department of Industrial Engineering North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC 
27695-7906, U.S.A. modeling a. broad range of input processes. We intro­duce B6zier surfaces as the parametric 
form for the representation of the bivariate input processes that arise in simulation experiments. We 
implemented this methodology in a Microsoft Windows-based software system called PltlklE-Probabilistic 
Input Modeling Environment,. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe 
our technique for the con­ struction, manipulation, ancl simulation of bivariate B&#38;zier distributions 
as well as the corresponding con­ditional univa.riate B6zier distributions. In Section 3 we describe 
the implement at ion of this methodology in PRIME, and in Section 4 we present some exam­ples illustrating 
the diversity of bivariate distribu­ tions that can be modeled using this methodology. Finally, in Section 
5 we summarize the main contri­ butions of this work. This paper is based on Flanigan (1993). 2 FORMULATION 
OF BIVARIATE 13EZIER DISTRIBUTIONS 2.1 Definition of B6zier Surfaces Starting from a set of control 
points represented by ..)T:~= the column vectors {q~,j ~ (*i,j, ?A,j, G,~ O,l,..., nt, j = 0,1,..., n,v}, 
we have the corre­sponding t~vo-dilllellsiolla.l B6zier surface in three­dimensional space that is given 
parametrically as for all tx, tv e [0, 1], where is the tth Bernstein polynomial of degree m.; see Farin 
(1990). Jvagner and ~t~ilson (1993) provide some mo­tivation for using weights of the form (2) to construct 
324 a parametric representation of a curve or surface as a convex combination of a set of appropriately 
defined control points.  2.2 Bivariat e B6zier Dist ributiou Functions If (X, Y)T is a continuous random 
vector with bounded support [z*, z*] x [Y*, y ], unknown cumu­lative distribution function (c.d.f.) FxY 
(., .), and un­known probability density function (p.d.f.) .fxy (,, 0)} then we can approximate I xlZ 
(., O) with an appro­priate B6zier surface of the form (1), where the control points {qi,j } have been 
arranged so as to ensure the basic requirements of a joint distribut­ion function: (a) FXY (z, y) is 
monotonically non­decreasing and continuous from the right in z and y; (b) FxY(~* , ?4) = O for all y 
and FxY(o, y.) = O for all z; (c) FXY(Z*, Y*) = 1; and (d) Fxl, (xz, Yt) ­FxY(zl, y2)-FxY(z2, yl)+FXI, 
(zl, y1) >0 ifxl < Z2and yl < y2. In view of the computational and statistical ad­vantages of univaria.te 
B6zier distributions detailed in Wagner and Wilson (1993), we seek to formulate the bivariate B6zier 
c.d.f. Fxy (., ) so that the marginal distribution of X is a univaria.te B6zier distribution whose c.d.f. 
Fx (.) is represented parametrically by for all t= E [0, 1], where the ith control point in (3) is pi 
S [xi x), z\x)]T. Similarly, we seek a setup in which the marginal distribution of Y is a univariate 
B6zier distribution whose c.d.f. Fy ( ) is represented parametrically by j=O for all tv G [0, 1], where 
the jth control point in (4) is A s expla.iuecl in l?lanigan (1993), 1~ ~ [Y:), Z~y)]T. the coordinates 
of the control points used in displays (l), (3), and (4) must related as follows: Z~,j Yi,j = = Jx) y~Y)

 In terms of the setup specified by displays (3)-(6), we see that the joint c.d.f. FX.Y(., .) of the 
B6zier ran­dom vector (X, Y )T is given parametrically by for all t$, ty G [0, 1]; and it is straightforward 
to ver­ify that a bivariate B6zier distribution for (X, Y):r whose c.d.f. Fxy(., .) is defined by equations 
(5)-(7) will have marginal c .d .f. s Fx (.) and F]. (.) for X and Y that are given parametrically by 
(3) and (4), re­spectively. Notice that the stochastic dependency between X and Y is represented by the 
{.z~,j : i == 1 . . . nz-l; j= l,..., nv 1} that is, by the 2­c:ordinates that are notspecified in (6). 
If X and Y are independent, then we take %i,j = .zi X). z(y) fori=l,..., nlandj=j= 1,...,7z1 1 so that)tlle 
joint distribution function factors into the product of the two marginal distribution functions: Q,(t~,

random vector (X, Y)T whose joint c.d.f. F x}, (., .) is specified by equation (1), the corre­sponding 
joint p.d.f. jxy (., .) is given parametrically by Q (tz, tv) (9) = [Q;. (t.,, tv), QJ(t~ , tg ), Q:(t=, 
t/)lT = [P.c(t$), QJ(tZ, tg)]T Ly(tY)! for all t$, ty E [0, 1], where  !l =-lny-1 1=-1~ (~r)BnY-l,j(ty)

j= 0,1, . . ..ng -1) representing the corresponding second partial differ­ences of the z-coordinates 
of those control points. A detailed justification of (9) ( 11) is given in Flanigan (1993). 2.4 Conditional 
B6zier Distributions Given Y = Y(tv) -LY(tY), the conditional c.d.f. of X at the point z(tr) = Pz (t~ 
) is univariate B6zier with provided $Y [y(ty )] >0. It follows from (12) that the control points { [~i, 
zi X1] )]T : i = 0,1,..., n$} for the B6zier curve representing the conditional distribution of X given 
Y = y(tv ) have the same x-coorclinates as in (3); and the corresponding z-coordinates are given by Zi(Xlyl 
_ j=O fori=O, l,.. ., n~. An analogous formulation yields FYIX (. I), the conditional distribution of 
Y given .Y. 2.5 Covariance between B6zier Variates The covariance between X ancl Y is given by n. l 
n -1 where for2=0,1,. ... n0, forj=O, l,..., ny, and A~Aj z, ,j is defined by (11). For the random variable 
X (respective] y, Y), the ex­pected value E[X] (respectively, E[Y]) and the vari­ance Var[X] (respectively, 
Var[] ] ) are readily evalu­ated using computational formulas given in Wagner and Wilson (1993) and derived 
in Flanigan (1993). Thus Corr(X, Y), the correlation between X and Y is readily evaluated as COV(X, Y)/[Var(X)Var(Y)] 
1/2. 2.6 Generation of 136zier Vectors The random vector (X, Y)T can be generated us­ing the method 
of conditional distributions as fol­lows. Given a pair of independent random numbers U1 and [J2, we compute 
Y from U1 by inversion of the marginal c .d.f. FX ( .); then given Y, we com­pute A-from U2 by inversion 
of the conditional c.d.f. FX lY (. IY). Specifically, this involves the following steps: 1, Generate 
U1, Uz * Uniform[O, 1] independently. 2. Find ~Y c [0,1] such that 7%~ 1; (17) ~~ny,j(iv)z} ) = j=O 3.

(18). 3 MODELING BIVARIATE BEZIER DIS-TRIBUTIONS USING PRIME PRIME, Probabilistic Input Mocleling Environment, 
is a graphical Microsoft Windows-based software sys­tem that incorporates the methodology developed in 
Section 2 to help an analyst estimate the bivariate input processes that arise in large-scale simulation 
studies. PRIME is designed for IBM-compatible mi­crocomputers equipped with a math coprocessor and a 
pointing device such as a mouse. It is written en­tirely in the C programming language, and it haa been 
developed to run uncler version 3.1 of Microsoft IVindows (Microsoft Corporation 1992). PRIME is de­signecl 
to be easy and intuitive to use. The construc­tion of a bivariat,e distribution is performed through

Typical Bivariate PRIME Session the actions of the mouse, and several options are con­veniently available 
through menu selections. In PRIME, theusermanipu]ates the marginal clis­tributions independentlyof each 
other; then to com­plete the construction of a bivariate input model, the user manipulates the joint 
p.d.f. (9) or selected conditional c.d.f. s like (12). For example, to edit (subjectively estimate) the 
marginal c.d.f. (4) of Y, the user may add, delete, or move the control points {lj:j=o,l,..., nv} by 
moving the mouse within a window depicting FY(. ). Control points are repre­sented aa small black squares, 
and each control point is given a unique label corresponding to its index j in equation (4). Each control 
point acts like a magn­et pulling the curve in the direction of the control point, where the Bernstein 
polynomials (2) govern thestrength of the magnetica ttraction ofeach con­trol point. The movement of 
a control point causes the displayed curve to be updated (nearly) instan­taneously. Figure 1 displays 
a typical PRIME ses­sion depicting abivariate joint density ~Xy(,.) with COV(X, Y) = 2.657 and Corr(A 
, Y) = 0.345, the marginal density fx (.), and the conditional density fx,y(.lY = 4.0). In addition to 
subjective estimation of bivariate Bdzier distributions by interactive manipulation of the control points, 
PRIME allows data-driven estimat­ion of the control points that yield the best tit to the sample data 
according to a variety of statistical­estimation principles. In the next section we illustrate both modes 
of operation for PRIME. 4 EXAMPLES 4.1 Fit ting Bivariate Distributions Subjectively In the absence of 
data, PRIME can be used to con­struct a bivariate input process conceptualized from subjective information 
and expertise. The represen­tation of the conceptualized distribution is achieved by: (a) constructing 
the two marginal distributions by manipulating the control points associated with each marginal distribution; 
and (b) representing the clependencies between the two marginal distributions by either moving the control 
points associated with the joint density, or by moving the control points as­sociated with the conditional 
distributions. For example, suppose it is known that the process­ing times for two successive manufacturing 
operation are negatively correlated, with correlation coefficient of 0.37. The distribution of the first 
processing time is denoted by .Y, where X is known to have a mini­mum value of 2 minutes, a maximum value 
of 6 minu­tes, and a most likely (modal) value of 3 minutes. The distribution of the second processing 
time is de­noted by Y, where Y is known to have a minimum value of 3 minutes, a maximum value of 9 minutes, 
and a most likely (modal) value of 6 minutes. To con­ struct the joint clistribution of (/Y, Y), we must 
fir:]t define the two marginal distributions. Figure 2 shows the two marginal clistributions that were 
defined by placing the control points corresponding to the re­ spective marginal distributions. After

Figure 2: A Bivariate Distribution of Processing distributions were satisfactorily constructed, the de­pendencies 
between X and 1 were modeled. In this case, the dependencies were modeled by moving the control points 
associated with the conditional distri­butions until the correlation of the fitted joint dis­tribution 
was approximately equal to 0.37. In Fig­ure 2, the displayed joint distribution has a correla­tion of 
0.369. 4.1.1 Uniform Marginal Distributions Figure 3 depicts a PRIME session where each marginal distribution 
is uniform; that is, X = Uniform[O, 10] and Y * Unifornl[O, 10]. Figure 3 displays a bivariate distribution 
for (.Y, Y)T with COV(X, Y) = 5.322 and Corr(X, Y) = 0.645. Be­neath the window containing the joint 
p.d.f., there are two windows displaying the marginal c.d.f. s, Fx (. ) and FY ( .); and these latter 
windows also display as dashed curves the corresponding marginal p.d.f. s, j x(.) and fy(.). To the right 
of the joint p.d.f. win­dow are two windows depicting the conditional c .cl.f. s ~YIx( lx = 9.0) and 
FXly(.lY = 2.0); and these c.d.f. windows also display as dashed curves the cor­responding conditional 
p.d .f. s. As showu in the joint p.d.f. window, most of the probability mass is con­centrated along the 
line y = m + 10. 4.1.2 Nonuniform Marginal Distributions Figure 4 depicts the joint c.d .f. and p.d

Fitting Bivariate Distributions to Data Suppose that a random sample {(Xk, Yk)T : k = 1,2, . . . . m} 
has been taken from an unknown contin­uous bivaria.te distribution, and we seek to approx­imate this 
distribution with a biva.riate B6zier c.d.f. FA-}~(., .). Let Fnz(x,y) = #{(.l k,ll) : xk < ~, Y/i < 
Y}/rn denote the corresponding empirical c.d.f., and let F,,, (x) and G,,, (y) denote the corresponding 
marginal empirical c .cl.f. s for X and Y, respectively. After fitting a. marginal distribution separately 
to each component of the random sample {(XL, Yk)T}, the user can model the dependencies between these 
components. The dependencies are modeled by mov­ing the control points associated with either the joint, 
B6zier p.d.f. fxl, (., .) or the conditional B6zier c.d.f. s or p.d.f. s until the desired stochastic 
de­pendence is achieved. Figure 5 displays the fit­ted joint p.d.f., a superimposed bivariate histogram, 
and the fittecl marginal distributions that were es­timated by i,he method of moments from a random sample

Several aspects of this work require further clevel­opment. Of particular interest is the extension of 
the methodology to handle trivari~te and higher­dimensitmal distributions. For subjective estimation 
of continuous multivariate distributions, we also re­quire more comprehensive techniques for visually 
rep­resenting and manipulating general types of stochas­tic dependence. For data-driven estimation of 
con­tinuous multivariate distributions, we require fully automated fitting schemes to estimate not only 
the marginal distributions of the target ranclom vector but also the stochastic dependency structure 
between components of that random vector. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was partially supported by a David
