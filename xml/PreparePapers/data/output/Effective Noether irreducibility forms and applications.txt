rpi. edu An absolutely irreducible multivariate polynomial is a polynomial that cannot be factored even 
if the coefficients of the factors can Yle in any field above the original coefficient field. For example, 
an absolutely irreducible polyn~ mial with rational number coefficients does not factor over the field 
of complex numbers. We consider algorithms that factor a multivariate polynomial into absolutely irreducible 
polynomials. Our contributions are essentially threefold. First, we estimate the blt complexity of our 
generic algorithms, which are defined for algebraic ex­tensions of an arbitrary coefficient field, so 
that the polynomial size growth estimates apply to any input field in which elements are canonical y 
represented. The generic analysis also yields several effective irreducibility y theo­rems, among them 
a new effective Hilbert irreducibility theorem, which reduces the number of random bits previ­ously needed 
when factoring polynomials in many variables. Finally, we introduce the single path lazy factoriza­tion 
representation model for elements in algebraic extension fields, with which the problem of factoring 
polyno­mials with rational number or rational function coefficients can be solved within the parallel 
computational com­plexity class MC. As a consequence, arbitrary high precision complex rational approximations 
or, in the function field case, truncated power series approximations, of the factor coefficients can 
be computed from our represen­tation, again within NC complexity. One of our irreducibility y theorems 
also gives an upper bound on the accu­racy needed to keep the approximations of the absolutely irreducible 
factors themselves absolutely irreducible. 1. Introduction polynomials with rational coefficients into

Note that irre­@ 1991 ACM 089791-397-3/91/0004/0054 $1.50 ducibility over an arbitrary field cannot be 
decided by arithmetic alone (van der Waerden 1930). The forms we derive for polynomials of degree din 
n variables, which hence have ~~d) variables themselves, are shown to be of degree 0(d6) with integer 
coefficients with about O(d7 + den) digits (see Theorem 3 below). Already Noether applied her forms to 
prove a the­orem by Ostrowski (1919). That theorem states that mapping an integral polynomial into a 
finite field by taking the coefficients modulo a prime preserves abso­lute irreducibility for all but 
finitely many primes. A similar theorem considers mapping a rational function field into its field of 
constants by setting the generating function to a constant (cf. (Deuring 1941)). We derive an effective 
upper bound on the number of primes and constants, respectively, that have bad reduction with respect 
to a given polynomial. Clearly, bounds of poly­nomial magnitude can yield a parallel irreducibility test 
using modular imaging, and we present such an algo­rithm for the function field case (see 35). Two additional 
effective irreducibility theorems are presented. First, we prove new probability bounds for the Hilbert 
irreducibility theorem: substituting affine linear forms in two variables for the variables in a multi­variate 
polynomial over a field can be shown to preserve irreducibility in almost all cases (Hilbert 1892, Satz 
at the bottom of p. 117). For a perfect field, that is a field over which any irreducible polynomial 
has distinct roots, we can show that irreducibility is not preserved with probability less than 2d4/card(R), 
where d is the degree of the multivariate preimage and card(R) is the cardinality of the set from which 
the coefficients for the bivariate linear forms are uniformly selected. Second, we show that a complex 
multivariate polynomial suffi­ciently near to an absolutely irreducible one must re­main absolutely irreducible. 
Distance is measured as the maximum absolute value of the coefficient differ­ences as complex numbers, 
and we give an effective bound for the required nearness to absolutely irreducible polynomials with algebraic 
number coefficients. We use these estimates to guarantee when one converts the ab­solutely irreducible 
factors produced by our algorithms to polynomials with approximate complex rational co­efficients that 
these approximate factors are absolutely irreducible themselves. In order to derive our irreducibility 
forms we need to analyze the variant of our algorithm for absolute ir­reducibility testing (Kaltofen 
1985) that executes that algorithm on generic inputs, that is polynomials whose coefficients are indeterminates. 
We obtain polynomial degree and norm size bounds for all intermediately com­puted rational function field 
elements (see Theorem 2 below). These estimates also make it possible to formu­late the bit complexity 
of that algorithm without spec­ifying the actual coefficient field. For if we know that all arithmetic 
operations, that is +, -, x, +, and = O?, on field elements of polynomial size is of polynomial­time 
bit complexity, then we can conclude that our ab­solute irreducibility test is also of polynomial-time 
bit complexity, that is the size of all intermediate values stay polynomially bounded. of course, the 
actual ele­ment representation must be canonical with respect to the arithmetic operations. A famous 
counter-example otherwise is that of computing polynomial GCDS us­ing quotient field arithmetic without 
reducing numer~ tors and denominators by a common factor, which re­ sults in exponential bit complexity 
for an algorithm with quadratic arithmetic complexity (Knuth 1981, p. 414, Eq. (27)). We will also give 
several multivariate factoring re­sults which belong to the parallel complexity class NC. While we can 
rely on the fact that the complex roots of a univariate polynomial can be approximated to high precision 
within AfC (Neff 1990), we also must consoli­date the use of several algorithms described for generic 
fields of characteristic O, such as the black-box factor­ization algorithm (Kaltofen and Trager 1990) 
or the generic version of the sparse polynomial interpolation algorithm (Ben-Or and Tiwari 1988). To 
this end, we introduce a suitable (non-canonical) representation for elements in an algebraic number 
field. It is based on the lazy factorization model of algebraic numbers intro­duced by Dicrescenzo and 
Duval (1987), who modify the Kronecker model of representing algebraic numbers in a polynomial algebra 
modulo a minimal polynomial by allowing reducible defining equations for the algebraic numbers generating 
the number fields, This model, however, is not an abstract data type for a field: one cannot generally 
test elements for equality (see 34). We amend this model in the spirit of Collins (1975) by associating 
with each number field generator a com­plex high precision floating point number that isolates a root 
of the defining equation (cf. (Lombardi 1989)). We thus get a true realization of the abstract data type 
for a field, and we can obtain all five arithmetic oper­ations within the complexity class MC. Therefore, 
by using the generic size estimates of our algorithm, and by accounting for the possibility of size growth 
due to the non-canonical nature of the representation (namely the avoidance of integer GCD and rational 
polynomial factorization), we obtain, for instance, an algorithm for computing arbitrary precision approximations 
to all sparse complex factors of a sparse multivariate integral polynomial, that within a randomized 
version of the complexity class AfC. The constructed Boolean circuit has a delay that is of the order 
of a polynomial in the logarithm of the number of variables, of the coefficient size, of the number of 
non-zero monomials in the input and in the sparse factors, and of the number of dig­its in the precision. 
With the lazy factorization model for algebraic extensions of a rational function field it becomes similarly 
possible to compute high order trun­cated power series approximations to the coefficients of the absolutely 
irreducible factors of a multivariate poly­nomial with rational function coefficients. Further Discussion 
of Earlier Work: Schmidt (1976) has analyzed Noether s elimination theoretic construc­tion and obtained 
doubly exponential bounds for the degrees and coefficient sizes of these forms. Heintz and Sieveking 
(1981) give the first effective randomized re­duction to bivariate absolute irreducibility testing (the 
Bertini irreducibility theorem). The key argument to transfer this approach effectively to irreducibility 
over the coefficient field itself (the Hilbert irreducibility the­prem) is due to von zur Gathen (1985). 
Polynomial­time factorization algorithms for rational multivariate polynomials into complex factors are 
obtained from a key lemma, proven in several places (Chistov and Grig­oryev 1983, Lemma 1), (Trager 1984, 
Chapter 3, Sec­tion 2), (Kaltofen 1985, Theorem 1), and (Dvornicich and Traverso 1987, Criterion on p. 
223), that restricts the algebraic extension field for the coefficients of an individual factor. A purely 
rational solution for the ab­solute irreducibility test is given by the author (Kalt­ofen 1985, Algorithm 
2), which also yields an NC algo­rithm. The rationality of the problem also follows el­egantly from the 
lazy factorization model for algebraic extension fields (Duval 1990). Bajaj et al. (1989) show how to 
count the number of complex factors in ~C, and give an effective version of the Bertini theorem for complex 
coefficients whose failure probability estimate is d4/card(R) (compare this with the discussion above); 
they use the geometry of real algebraic varieties and the Sturm sequence model for real algebraic numbers. 
Notation: The symbols Z, Q, and C, denote the sets of int egers, rational numbers, and complex numbers, 
re­spectively. By ~ we denote the algebraic closure of a field K, and by QF( D) the field of quotients 
of an inte­gral domain D. We use the symbols := and =: to define new mathematical objects (the new quantities 
being on the side of the colon), and we use the symbols e and ~ as assignment operators in program code.

the multivariate factoriza­tion algorithm presented in (Kaltofen 1985) with the slight generalization 
to arbitrary characteristic for the coefficient field K. The algorithm requires a good start­ing point 
for the used Newton root approximation al­gorithm, and therefore restrict the input polynomials somewhat. 
For fields of characteristic O it is easy to precondition the inputs so that this condition holds. Algorithm 
Factorization over the Algebraic Closure Input: f(z, y) E K[z, y] monic in x, d := degc(~), K an arbitrary 
field, such that the resuIt ant Resz(.f(z, O), tlf(z, 0)/dz) #O. (1) Output: Either ~ will be certified

distinct, polyno­mial factors of f (z, y), .fi(~, Y) E Li[z, Y] with Lj := K(<i), where <~, 1< i < d, 
are the roots of ~(z, O) in ~. The idea of the algorithm is to compute the approxi­mation of a root of 
f (x, y) in ~[[y]], and then find the corresponding minimal polynomial in ~[z, y]. Set the maximum order

in Li, then set /4=0 6=0 and exit the loop. At this point, j i c Li [x, y] c ~[z, y] is an absolutely 
irreducible factor of f. If the sys­tem has no solution and i = 1 and m = d -1, then designate f absolutely 
irreducible and exit the entire algorithm. l The problem arises how to represent elements in L{, including 
<i, such that one can solve (2) over Li. One solution is to factor f(z, O) = I#l(z) . . . #r(z) such 
that @i are irreducible factors in K[z]. Then we can choose the Kronecker model and represent elements 
in Li in K+ Kz-I-.. . + Kzdeg(~:j-l c K[z]. Notice that all conjugates of (i are represented in this 
way. With this representation the system (2) can be converted to a linear system over K. In (Kaltofen 
1989) we further discuss how this method can reduce the prob­lem of finding all distinct absolutely irreducible 
factors of f (z,y) to the problem of factoring in K[z]; in par­ticular, we show how one and the same 
factor that is produced simultaneously by different +~1 and q%,, or different roots of ~i, can be identified. 
The Kronecker representation (3) requires the factor­ization of f (z, O) and therefore does not yield 
an abso­lute irreducibility test based on arithmetic alone. Al­ready in (Kaltofen 1985) we have removed 
this require­ment. Essentially, we perform the algorithm simult ane­ously for all non-isomorphic Li, 
that is, in K[%]/(f(z,0))s K[z]/(#I(z)) @ 0. @ K[zl/(4+(~)) in place of in each separate Li. This model 
of algebraic number field arithmetic, which means algebraic number addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and zero­testing, has been formalized by Dicrescenzo and Duval (1987): an algebraic number 
~ is represented by a not necessarily irreducible, but square free, defining equation +(z) c K[z], +(() 
= O. Elements /3 E K(<) are represented as elements in the algebra K[,z]/(@(z)). The element ~ is not 
zero if GCDz(~, ~) = 1, interpreting /3 as an element in K[z]. In that case, @ can be inverted by computing 
the Eu­clidean scheme If ~ and @ are not relatively prime in K[z], then, ac­cording to Dicrescenzo and 
Duval (Ioc. cit.), the com­putation has to split. If< is a root of GCDQ3, ~), then the element ,8 is 
zero, otherwise it is not zero. In both cases, we obtain new defining equations for <. We call this representation 
of algebraic number fields the lazy factorization model. We observe that, due to our in­put assumption, 
no zero-test needs to be performed in Step N, since the only division is by (df(z,0)/c%)(z) (mod f(z, 
O)). 3. Effective Irreducibility y Theorems Our effective irreducibility theorems hinge on the generic 
coefficient size growth in the Factorization algorithm of 32. Let eI=O e2=0 be a generic monic degree-d 
polynomial, d ~ 2, that is, its coefficients lie in the ring D := Z[..., ce1,e2,...] By c s we denote 
the set of these indeterminate coeffi­cients. The algorithm computes in step N powers of a truncated 
power series for a root a of ~ in z, AT=o where a~ i)E QI?(13)[z]/(fo( z)), fo($) := f(x, O) G D[x]. 
Notice that for a specific polynomial f E K[z, y] we specialize the Cts to the coefficient values and 
z to a root ~ of fo. Theorem 1. For the polynomial we have degc,,(p) ~ 2d 1, IIplll < (2cl)3d, and foralll~i

pro­ceedings we must omit the proofs of all the theorems in this section. We can now bound the size of 
any arising minor when solving the linear systems (2) of the algorithm, again using the generic input 
polynomial ~. The coefficients of the linear forms under consideration are first brought onto the common 
denominator pmaxio, 2~-1}, that is, Lm) +51m sd}~min 2 2k-1 ~P!l~.~ = 0-( ) p=o 1=0 Hence, the coefficient 
matrix of the system has elements in D[.z]/(~o(z)) that are to be evaluated at the coeffi­ cients of

1s 1< m(d + 1); note that m(d + 1)isthe number of unknowns in (2) and (5,). Then The significance of 
this theorem does not lie in the actual estimates, which may be high, but in the con­clusion that the 
algorithm Factorization over the Coef­ficient Field have polynomial size growth in the arising intermediate 
coefficients, independent what the model of algebraic number arithmetic is or what particular co­efficient 
field K one has. The degree estimates in Theorem 2 (with modifica­tions) enable us to establish the following 
effective ver­sion of a Hilbert irreducibility theorem. Theorem 3. Let K be a perfect field, and suppose 
g G KIX1, . . . . X~]. RandomJy, select elements vl, .. . ,vn, w,wn, r)2,, r)2, . . ..qn ERc K uniformJy 
from the set R. Then the probability that in K[x, y] has the same number of irreducible factors over 
K a-sg is no less than 1 2 deg(g)4/card(R). Any algebraically closed field is perfect, and hence Theorem 
3 applies. This fact is crucial in the degree and norm bounds of the following theorem, which establishes 
our effective Noether irreducibility forms, Note that our theorem has the condition (1) removed, which 
is accomplished by using transcendental extensions of the coefficient field. Theorem 4. Let d ~ 2 and

Noether s original argument, we can derive an effective version of the 1919 theorem by Ostrowski from 
Theorem 4. In that theorem, one considers an absolutely irreducible degree d polynomial f(x~,..., xn)= 
E h,..,.nw . x? el+...+e~<d with qe,,,..,en = Z[t], where t is an algebraic integer over Q. Let its 
minimal polynomial be g(z) c Z[.z], g(f) = O, deg(g) = m. Using the Kronecker model for the coefficients, 
and hav­ing eliminated a rational integer denominator, we de­note by llfll~,l = e~,~m{ll~e,,..,emlll}. 
where qel ,,,.,e~ are taken as m l-degree polynomials over Z. For an unratified rational prime p in 
Q(t), that is a prime that does not divide the discriminant of g, any prime ideal pin the ring of (algebraic) 
integers (3Qfc) o Z [&#38;] of Q(t) that contains or, as one says, lies above p Z is maximal, and hence 
F@ := OqfJ/@ is a finite field. In fact, p corresponds to an irreducible factor gl(z) C ~/(P) [z] of 
g mod p, such that where the coefficients of gl are taken as rational inte­gers. By ~ mod p we denote 
the polynomial where the coefficients gel ,..,,en are mapped into Fv using the stan­dard subjection.

absolute irreducibility of (~ mod p) is preserved for all prime ideals p above pmin is of order Pmin 
= O(log(C)). We can use this fact to count the number of irreducible complex factors of a ra­ tional 
polynomial within NC. In ~5 we will demonstrate this approach for function fields. Using the effective 
Noether forms, it is also possible to derive and estimate on how near the coefficients of a complex polynomial 
~have to be to the coefficients of an absolutely irreducible polynomial ~ E Z[&#38;] [Xl, . . . . Xn] 
in order for ~ to also be absolutely irreducible. Note that interpreting the algebraic number ~ as a

complexity results for factor­ing multivariate polynomials over certain algebraically closed fields. 
Our results establish membership of the considered factorization problems in the complexity class NC. 
In this section we shall deal with computing high precision complex approximations to the absolute irre­ducible 
factors of multivariate polynomials with rational or algebraic coefficients. In order to apply the algorithm 
of ~2 to the MC setting we first need to modify the lazy factorization model for representing algebraic 
numbers, which is also discussed in 12. Recall that in the lazy factorization model an alge­braic number 
/3 E K(<) is represented by a residue modulo $(z) c K[z] with 4(() = O. Now consider ~(z) = (22 -2)(Z 
-18) C Q[z], and assume that the computation has split and the resulting algebraic num­ bers of the two 
branches are There are conjugates of both defining equations such that the resulting algebraic numbers 
both represent W. Hence, we observe that the representation of an alge­braic number in the lazy factorization 
model of K(() does not realize the full-fledged abstract data type of a field; by that we mean a representation 
that allows the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and test for being zero of elements of 
K(<). In fact, it is the zero test which in the lazy factorization model leads to a split in the computation, 
rather than to a yes/no outcome. The idea for our new representation is the following. Let K be an algebraic 
number field Q(c), ( algebraic over Q with minimal polynomial g ~ Z[zo]. We need to represent an element 
,B c K(<), where ~ is algebraic over K. Let us assume first that we are given a squarefree integral polynomial 
+(z) 6 Z[z] with ~(<) = O. We now associate a complex rational ~ c Q(i), i := ~, with ( such that F uniquely 
identifies a comple~ root of O. A standard way of doing this is to choose ~ a sufficient approximation 
of ( 6 C, e.g., IC -cl< ~ lDisc(+)llj2 rn-(~+2)i211@ll~- , (6) where m := deg(~) and Disc is the polynomial 
discrim­ inant operator 1 84(2) Res O(z), ~ . isC(@) = ~dcfZ @(z) () Note that the right hand side quantity 
in (6) is 1/2 of Mahler s (1964) root separation for ~, hence for any conjugate < e C with @((*) = O 
and ( # (, the distance l( ~lis larger than that quantity. In order to find ~ from the coefficients of 
~ within the complexity class NC we make use of the recent result by Neff (1990). If the coefficients 
of @ are elements in Q(t), we can approximate the roots of the norm ~ with respect to the splitting field 
of Q(f), NQ(c)(ti) := Res~ (g(~),4(w,z))c UZI, where ~ E Z[w, Z] and ~(~, ~) = 0, In that case, the specific 
conjugate_of ~ haa to be isolated ~s well by a complex rational < c Q(i). Choosing both ~ and ( close 
enough to their corresponding complex numbers ~ and ~, it is possible to decide which of the roots of 
the N~(CJ(@) are roots of ~(~, Z) (Neff 1990, !j3). An element /3 E K(() is now represented by the triple 
with /3 = x(<). As in the lazy factorization model, zero-testing requires the (ICD computation -y(z) 
:= GCD(X(Z), ~(z)). Then /3 = O if and only if 7(<) = O, which can be checked using the approximate root 
~. Non-zero elements can be inverted again using the Eu­clidean scheme dz)x(z) + r(~)o(~) = 7(Z)) and 
we get as the representation of /3-1, +), vXz)/7(Z), t E Q(i). Arithmetic now has changed from the lazy 
factorization model in that the operands may have different defining equations, say /31 = x,l(<) with 
@l(<) = O and ~z = X2(<) with 42(0 = 0. We Can compute and then perform the arithmetic operations modulo 
43. In conclusion, we have described a complete set of field operations for a particular representation 
of the field K(<), all of which can be performed in MC; a par­allel computation of the Euclidean scheme 
items a and r is shown in (Borodin et al. 1981). We call this model for K(i) the single path lazy factorization 
model. Note that the representation for ,0 is not canonical, since we may use different defining equations 
~. More signifi­cantly, when using the NC polynomial GCD algorithm, we cannot put the coefficients of 
c into canonical ra­tional form, that is, we cannot reduce the numerator and denominator of the rational 
number coefficients of the elements in K. Of course, if we work within the complexity class P, such constraints 
are not present. Using this single path lazy factorization model for al­gebraic number fields, the effective 
estimates given in \3, and the Neff s (1oc. cit.) recent result on approxi­mating complex roots of rational 
polynomials, we can now present several results on computing factorization over the complex numbers. 
Theorem 7. For ~ G Q(&#38;)[X, Y] C C[X, Y], where Q(f) is an aJgebraic number field in single path lazy 
fac­torization represent ation, algorithm Factorization over the Complex Numbers can compute a]] absolutely 
ir­reducible factors off within the complexity class NC. The representation of the factors over the fields 
Q(C, <i) will again be in the single path lazy factorization model. Proof. We apply algorithm Factorization 
over the Alge­braic Closure of $2 to the squarefree and appropriately translated factors of ~ (see (Kaltofen 
1985, $2)). The main problem is to factor a polynomial ~ c Q(~)[z, y] that satisfies (1) and whose coefficients 
are in single path lazy factorization representation. Clearly, algorithm Factorization over the Algebraic 
Closure can be executed in poly-log depth with respect to arithmetic in the fields Li. Also by Theorem 
1, the canonical representatives of all computed elements of Li are bounded in size by a polynomial in 
deg(f) and Ilf !l~. Using the single path lazy factorization model for arithmetic in Li, it remains to 
establish that the size of rational coefficients does not accumulate by re­peated divisions. This is 
established by observing that divisions only occur twice: first, there are divisions by powers of Resz 
(?(z, O), (t?f/6 z)(z, O)) G Q(&#38;) in Step N. These divisions are accounted for by the analysis of 
the generic version of Step N in Theorem 1, where they cor­respond to division by powers of p. Second, 
a division occurs when solving the linear system (5). However, any of the poly-log algorithms computes 
such solutions by computing minors division free and then lastly dividing by a maximal non-singular minor 
(see (Borodin et al. 1982) and (Mulmuley 1987)). All other operations are additions, multiplications, 
and zero-tests, and do not contribute to size-growth in a non-canonical way. The theorem then follows 
from Theorem 2. H Theorem 7 leads to several corollaries, the first of which generalizes Neff s (1990) 
result to multivariate polynomials. Corollary 1. Given is a polynomial f c Z[x, y] and a precision 2 
E. We can find, within the com­plexity class NC in terms of the probJem size mea­sure deg(f) log(l\f112)E, 
exactly r absolutely irreducible polynomials fi (z, y) E Q(i) [z, y] such that for any of the r absolutely 
irreducible factors fi(z, y) c C[z, y] of f we have a j with IIf; fi,]]~ < 2-E. Proof Clearly, from 
the single path lazy factorization model we can by increasing the precision of the approxi­mation of 
the identifying points ~i for the fields Li obtain the factors off to any given precision 2-E. It remains 
to establish that one can reach a precision at which non­associate factors must be separated. Note that 
different roots can lead to the same absolutely irreducible com­plex factor. The fairly standard separation 
analysis is carried out in (Kaltofen 1989) not only for complex fac­ tors, but also for the corresponding 
real factors. Finally, by Theorem 6 we can approximate to a precision that guarantees the absolute irreducibility 
of the computed approximations. El The second corollary concerns multivariate factoriz~ tion. In fact, 
in this setting it is very convenient to view the single path lazy factorization model as an abstract 
data type for a coefficient field, since the theory of ob­t aining sparse or concise representations 
of the factors, say by black boxes (Kaltofen and Trager 1989), is formu­lated for such abstract fields. 
So can the theory of sparse interpolation (Ben-or and Tiwari 1988) and (Grigoryev et al. 1990). Although 
none of these algorithms single out divisions as operations of non-canonical size accu­mulation, as is 
the case for algebraic numbers in single path lazy factorization representation, by leading to AfC results 
that does not happen by default, so to speak, or as inspection of the algorithms proves. We shall not 
re­analyze all quoted algorithms from this point of view here, but only state a corollary, which is obtainable 
by the techniques in (Kaltofen and Trager 1989, Theo­rem 2). Corollary 2. Given is a sparse polynomial 
f E Z [Xl, . . . , X.] with S non-zero monomials, a precision 2-E, and a bound T. One can compute approximations 
to precision 2-E of all irreducible complex factors of f with no more than T non-zero monomials within 
the random­ized complexity class Monte-Carlo ZNC, i.e., the out­put is correct with probability no less 
than 1/2, with re­spect to the problem size measure n deg( f ) log(ll f I[m) x EST. As a theoretical 
complexity result for factoring poly­nomials we feel this corollary truly stands out. It states that 
using polynomially many Boolean gates, one can compute highly reliably an arbitrary precision approx­imation 
of all T-sparse complex factors of an S-sparse polynomial with n variables in parallel time (log(n deg 
f) + log(E log ll~llm) + log(ST))O( J 5. The Function Field Case In this section we investigate the case 
where the field of coefficients is a function field, which is special to the the­ory of factoring over 
the algebraic closure. We remark that for factorization over the coefficient field, transcen­dental extensions 
are, by a lemma of Gauss (1801, Arti­cle 42), equivalent to factorization with one additional variable. 
However, if we need to factor over the alge­braic closure of the transcendental extension, the theory 
is more involved. Abbott (1986) has seriously studied which approaches are the best from a sequential 
and practical point of view, having efficient closed form in­tegration of algebraic functions as his 
objective. Here we present a theoretical result with respect to the par­ allel complexity class NC. 
Our first approach is based the counterpart of Theo­ rem 5 for function fields. Suppose that f(xl,..., 
xn)= x @)x: .. .x:~ qe,,...,en(y, el+... +en<d is an absolutely irreducible polynomial over K(Y, @) 
with ~el,,..,en c K[y, ~], where @ is an algebraic func­tion over the the rational function field K(y). 
Let the minimal polynomial be g(z) c K[Y, z], g(@) = 0, degz(g) = m. Without loss of generality, we 
may assume that ldcf, (g) = 1, for otherwise we may extend K(y) by the algebraic function @/ldcfZ (g) 
instead. For a value p c ~ we can naturally project K[y, 6)] to K[f] where ~ is algebraic over K with 
g(p, ~) = O. We denote this projection by Ty*p, 8+(. Theorem 8. There exists a polynomial I G K[Y], 12 
md6(degv(f) deg(r)s + degy(g)). such that for all p 6 ~ and all roots f of g(p, .z), r(P) # O ~ ~Y+P, 
e+~(f) is irreducible in RIXl, . . .. Xn]. This theorem yields from Corollary 1 of Theorem 5 the NC result 
in the next theorem. One essentially tries sufficiently many p c Z such that for at least one each factor 
produced by the algorithm Factorization over the Algebraic Closure is mapped to an irreducible factor 
over K; for space considerate ions we shall skip the precise argument. Theorem 9. Given f ~ (Z[y]) [Xl, 
Xz], the problem of determining the number of irreducible factors of j in C(y) [Xl, X2] is within the 
complexity class NC with respect to the size measure deg( f ) log(ll f Ilm). We note that the same approach 
can also be used in conjunction with Theorem 5 to count the number of complex irreducible factors of 
a polynomial in Z[X, Y] within complexity JVC; that without computing approx­imations to complex numbers, 
as in Corollary 1 to The­ orem 7, or without computing St urm sequences for par­ allel real algebraic 
number arithmetic, as in Bajaj et al. (1989). A second approach is based on the single path lazy factorization 
model of ~4 for algebraic extensions. In the case here the ground field K is the rational func­tion field 
Q(y) and the algebraic element < is the alge­braic function 0. The single path model needs a unique identification 
of @ among the conjugates of the monic squarefree defining equation ~(z) ~ Z[y, z]. A natural idea is 
to use an initial segment of the Puiseux series expansion for 0. We may also assume that the defin­ing 
equation ~ remains squarefree at y = O, translating y=y + vwith v E Z and using Q(y ) as ground field, 
if necessary. Then the Puiseux series for all roots of O in Q(y) are power series, and we have actually 
shown in Step N of the Factorization algorithm of 52 how to compute truncated power series expansions 
in y from the roots of X(O, z). The algebraic function @ is thus identified by the constant term in its 
power series ex­pansion, f ~ C with +(0, C) = O. We will represent elements in the field Q(f) itself 
in the single path lazy factorization model. In summary, the single path lazy factorization model represents 
an element A c Q(y, E)) by the triple  x(z) E Q(v)[zI, 4(v,Z) E W, z], FC Q(i), where @(y, z) is monic 
in z and V(O, z) is squarefree, with the meaning that A = x(~), ~(y, ~) = O, and that ~ identifies a 
root ( E C of @(O, z) such that @= f+aly+azy2+, a~c~. Since the pair IL(O, z) c Z[z] and ~ can be used 
to repre­sent elements of Q(t) in the single path lazy factoriza­tion model, we may compute by Theorem 
7 @=(+a~y+.. . + alyt (mod yt+l), a~ E Q(t), within complexity NC. Using this representation for a field 
Q(y, 0), we can now establish a fact that corresponds to the statement of Corollary 1 to Theorem 7. At 
issue is how to distinguish equal degree non-associate absolutely irreducible factors of f ~ Z[y] [Xl, 
X2], whose coefficients lie in the fields Li = Q(y, E)i). By multiplying through with a common denominator 
of all such factors (cf. Theorem 2), we may suppose that the coefficients of the factors actually lie 
in Z[y, @] and that they have the same leading coefficient. Theorem 2 also produces both a bound on 
the degrees in y and the l-norms of the factor coefficients as polyno­mials in y and @. We now can separate 
distinct factors by computing high precision approximations of their co­efficients both in terms of high 
order truncated power series expansions and high precision rational approxi­mations of the complex term 
coefficients in the series. The analysis of how precise these approximations need to be in order that 
the zero-tests on approximations in Q(i) [y] of elements in Z[y, @] give correct results can follow the 
approach in (Kaltofen 1989). The argument there proceeds in two steps. First, an upper bound for the 
size of the coefficients of minimal polynomials of all factor coefficients is derived. If the coefficients 
of the same term in two factors are unequal, then the product of the corresponding minimal polyno­mials 
must be squarefree. Factor coefficients may also be distinguished by conjugation, in which case one only 
considers the corresponding minimal polynomial. The second step uses Mahler s root separation measure 
(6) (see !4) with the size bounds obtained for the product of any two minimal polynomials to determine 
a separat­ing precision. The corresponding approach to function fields requires the derivation of the 
bounds correspond­ing to the ones presented in (Kaltofen 1989, $3 and S5) as well as a separation lemma 
in the case of approxima­tions in Q(i) [y] of elements in C[[y]] that are roots of squarefree polynomials 
in Z[y, z]. Since not all roots of the minimal polynomial for a factor coefficient may be plain power 
series, we may bound the absolute value of the complex coefficients in the power series expansions of 
the actual factor coefficient by plugging a power se­ries expansion of @i into the factor coefficient 
in Li in lazy factorization representation, and then by appeal­ing to the estimates of Theorem 2. We 
shall omit the straight-forward but laborious estimates. Acknowledgement: I wish to acknowledge the help
