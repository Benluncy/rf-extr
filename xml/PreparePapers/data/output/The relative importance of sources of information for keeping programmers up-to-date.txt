 THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR KEEPING PROGRAMMERS UP-TO-DATE Robert P. Taylor 
Teachers College Columbia University James Fisher City of New York Introduction This paper reports 
on an extension of survey research begun in 1977 and reported previously. [i], [2] The first phase of 
that research dealt with how practicing programmers keep up to date, investigating the effects of educational 
background, age, working envirorment, and other factors on how up to date the progranmers claimed to 
be [i]. The measure of being up to date was based on the programmer's response to a multiple-item question 
about programming practice. That item included four sub-items involving structured programming concepts; 
the respondent's combined "score" on these four sub-items was the key. The original questionnaire is 
reproduced in Figure i. The sub-items are 16A through 16D. In the second phase, the same questionnaire, 
unmodified, was administered to a different group of programmers and the results compared. There we looked 
at the same factors and found similiar results. Upon analysing all respondent data together (data from 
both the first and the second phases), we arrived at several conclusions. [2] They included the following. 
 (i) Most respondents claimed to be aware of the structured progranmling concepts we presented.  (2) 
Of the thirteen sources of information on programming practice which respondents could choose from, two 
tended to be much more frequently chosen than any  others: (i) Fellow programmers;  (ii) Programming 
books and/or manuals.  (3) Respondent age seemed to correlate strongly with the degree to which the 
respondent claimed to have been influenced by structured programming concepts; yo~ger programmers claiming 
to have been more strongly influenced.  (4) Respondent educational background seemed to correlate strongly 
with the degree to which the respondent claimed to have been influenced by structured programming concepts; 
those with strong math and/or computer science backgrounds claiming to have been more strongly in fl 
uenced.  For the third phase, we wanted to see if a different sample would reflect these same findings. 
We also wanted to investigate two other things. First, we wanted to more closely examine the roles played 
by sources of information. In particular, we wanted to find out how frequently the programaer regarded 
the source through which he or she first heard of the concept as the most influential 34 D II 1[ I

Second, we wanted to see if respondent gender played any noticable role. Our earlier research hinted 
that gender might be important, but the samples used included too few females to base judgments upon. 
To extend our investigation to cover these two additional points, we had to do two things: modify the 
questionnaire and include more females in the sample. Sample Population for the Third Phase The sample 
for this phase includes 211 programners, from the data processing staffs of the New York City offices 
of three different companies: 108 from a bank, 74 from a utility, and the rest from a conglomerate. Tne 
sample spans a wide range of ages and educational backgrounds and includes 59 females. Of the 211, 108 
claimed 6 or fewer years of experience in progranming, and only 16 claimed more than 15 years. Th___e 
Survey Instrument for the Third Phase The questionnaire used in this phase was a modification of the 
one used in the first two phases. Figure 2 shows the modifications, all to item 16; comparison of Figures 
1 and 2 will show what the changes were. They were made to enable us to exanine more closely the relative 
importance of any source of information. Analysis of the Third Phase Data The data from the third phase 
was analysed as before, using cross tabulation to examine the relationships among various pairs of individual 
and combined variables. This time, in addition to the relationships examined in the first two phases, 
we also examined the information provided by the questionnaire modification. Results Since in the earlier 
phases we did not discriminate between first and later sources, Results between phases must be compared 
by using only the responses to the "MAIN" source on the new questionnaire, excluding responses to the 
"FIRST' source. First we will present all comparable findings between this and the earlier phases of 
our research. Then we will report our findings with respect to the two new areas we hoped to investigate: 
the role of progranmer gender and the influence of FIRST sources. Findings Comparable to Tnose in Earlier 
Research (i) Most programmers claimed to be familiar with the aspects of structured programming c~.

 admitting unfamiliarity with any one of the four aspects of structured programming was less than 6% 
of the number in the sample. This agreed closely with the findings from our earlier research. (2) Certain 
sources of information are apparently far more influen~ than others. As in the first two phases, we found 
that Fellow progranmers and Books and/or manuals were very influentlal-':-'--:-withprogrammers. Tn--ls'-~emains 
the case with this sample. However, this time, we found that in-house training was cited as even more 
influential than those other two sources. The findings are summarized in Figure 3. MAIN INFCRMATION

through D. Together, the first three sources shown account for over 50% of all the source citings by 
progranmers in this sample; all six sources together account for about 80% of all citings. In addition 
to suggesting the strong impact certain sources have upon progranmers, these findings and those from 
our earlier work suggest how little impact many other sources apparently have, at least with respect 
to programming practice as reflected in this questionnaire. From this alone, one might still believe 
that certain sources not important as MAIN sources might prove to be important as FIRST sources. As we 
shall see later, this study does not bear that out. (3) Respondent age seemed to correlate only weakly 
with claims of being strongly in~uenc~--structured progranming.--WTtl:~6--~h[~ sample, our previous finding 
about age was hardly evident from any simple cross tabulation of the data. A more complex analysis would 
be required to detect such a correlation in this data, if indeed there is one.  (4) Those claiming _a 
strong educational background claimed to be more strongly influenced b~ structured programming. The percentages 
and total respondent counts appear in Figure 4. Following [2], a rating of "strong" in educational background 
was based on the respondent's combined responses to questions 9 and I0. High school math only and None 
of the above would yield the weakest possible background score; A graduate degree in math and  Completing 
a graduate degree in computer science, the strongest. EDUCATIONAL INFLUENCE CLAIMED TOTAL BACKGROUND

this that female programmers generally keep more up to date than male. We found that the females in this 
sample tended to report stronger educational backgrounds than the males, so education may be playing 
an important role here. Finer discrimination within this saalple, and perhaps the surveying of additional 
samples, would be required before any conclusion could be drawn. Nevertheless, this preliminary finding 
raises interesting questions. The to__psix sources of information rated "FIRST" were those listed as 
"MAIN", but not in the same order of influence. Tne order of ~fluence and comparative numbers~citations 
appear in Figure 7. FIRST INFORMATION SOURCE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PROGRAMMERS CITING SOURCE AS: "F IRST"

Training school 25 16 Books and/or manuals 23 31 Installation standards 12 20 Figure 7 Colleges and 
programmer schools are obviously more important as first sources than as continuing ones. When their 
relative roles were examined further by studying the ages of those making the citations, the college 
and school citations were associated almost exclusively with programmers under 30. By contrast, In-house 
training, Fellow programmers, and Books and/or manuals, the top ~:~{~MAIN sources, were cited by all 
ages o--~-ogramners. Summary and Conclusions A survey was administered to 211 programmers working in 
three commercial data processing installations in New York City. Analysis strengthened some of our earlier 
findings and suggested more. It confirmed our earlier findings that: (i) most programmers are familiar 
with structured programming concepts; (2) most of their information on the latter comes from six sources 
and that over half comes from just three sources: in-house training, fellow programmers, and books and 
manuals; (3) educational background in math and computer science increases the likelihood of a programmer's 
claiming to be familiar with structured programming; and (4) orientation to others as users and modifiers 
of the programmer's software increases the same likelihood. Unlike our earlier work, it suggested that 
female progra~ners may be more up to date than their male colleagues. Clearly more work needs to be 
done in this area. Tne data we have already collected needs to be analysed further and more data should 
be collected, probably based upon some other reflector of programming practice than structured prcxjramming. 
We hope to report on more such work in subsequent papers and urge others to examine similar issues and 
report upon them. References i) Fisher, Alvarez, Taylor, "A Survey of How Practicing Programmers Keep
