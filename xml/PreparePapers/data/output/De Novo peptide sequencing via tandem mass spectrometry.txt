    Figure 3: The presence of ion types depending on position for spectra from our learning sample. 
Every rectangle corresponds to a partial peptide and color of rectangles indicates the presence/absence 
of different fragment ions. The intensity thresholds are defined based on the offset frequency function. 
The dark gray rectangle shows presence of both b and y ions where at least one of them exceeds the intensity 
threshold. The medium dark gray rectangle shows presence of b or y ion (but not both) exceeding the intensity 
threshold. The light gray rectangle shows presence of low intensity b and/or y ion or the presence of 
other ion type. White rectangle shows absence of any peak in the spectra that may be associated with 
that position. The dots in the middle of rectangles indicate that the mass of the actual partial peptide 
is correctly assigned with the top scoring sequence interpreted by Sherenga for the corresponding MS/MS 
spectrum. Dots in two consecutive columns indicate that Sherenga correctly interprets the amino acid 
between the two positions. 141
