 PANEL DISCUSSION Computer Science --Too Many Students, Too Many Majors Norman Gibbs, Moderator College

 Abstract During the last decade enrollments in computer sicence courses have increased dramatically. 
Classes are very large and faculty members are nearly impossible to re* cruit. The "seller's" job market 
has contributed to both of these problems and univcr- sities must deal with the problems of too many 
students and too many majors. The panelists have been asked to address the following questions: i) 
How large should classes be at the upper and lower levels? 2) Does everyone have a birthright to be 
a computer scientist? 3) Are there reasonable ways to limit enrollments? 4) Are we pleased with the 
quality of the average undergraduate computer science graduate? 5) Have academic standards declined 
because of large enrollments? Although the panelists do not have solutions to all of these problems 
we feel that it is important to identify them and discuss what sorts of alternatives have been tired. 
It is expected that about one-half of the session's time will be devoted to audience interaction. 143
