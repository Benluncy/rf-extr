 SIGGRAPHASIA2010 Computer Animation Festival Captain Banana SOUTH KOREA | 2010 | 4:40 Director Hoopyung 
Shin  Producer Jeonghee Kim In a deserted world, Captain Banana flies to the Banana swinging boat to 
operate it. Th e impatient passengers of the attraction, the so-called Littles force him to drive the 
boat faster and faster! Eventually, as the system overloads, the banana boat crashes and the littles 
bounce out the ball and fall into the nearby oasis. Captain Banana tries to avoid it but he ultimately 
fails to stop one of the littles to fall into the oasis, starting a process that was not meant to happen, 
but there is no way back... The animation presents a metaphor of the human conception process and the 
issues and concerns related to it. Captain Banana is the inner self of a normal man, he is sure of himself 
and confident of his capabilities but there is things that even a carefree super-hero cannot stop. With 
this short animation we wish to convey the message of how important is to think healthy and safely to 
avoid undesired situations.
