University Baton Rouge, LA 70803-6409, U.S.A.  ABSTRACT Nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPPs) are 
frequently used in stochastic simulations to model nonstationary point processes. These NHPP models are 
often constructed by estimating the parameters of the rate function from one or more observed realizations 
of the process. This paper focuses on the degree of accuracy to which the rate function parameters of 
the NHPP need to be estimated such that the simulation output performance measures are not signi.cantly 
different from performance measures that would be obtained for the underlying (true) process. INTRODUCTION 
Constructing a valid stochastic simulation model involves adequately modeling both the logical .ow of 
entities through the system of interest and the stochastic behavior of the system. The latter includes 
the selection of appropriate statistical models for interarrival times, delays, processing times, etc. 
Developing these statistical models may involve estimating parameters of probability distributions based 
on some observed data. Once the model is complete, one way to verify the simulation model is to compare 
the output performance measures of the model with those of the real system (Law and Kelton, 1991). If 
the simulation results are signi.cantly different than the observed measures of performance, then inferences 
made about the real system based on the model may lead to wrong and costly decisions. Therefore, accurately 
modeling the stochastic processes used in simulation models is critical to the success of the model s 
implementation. However, as the stochastic pro­cesses become increasingly complex, so do the methods 
re­quired to accurately model these processes. Consequently, the time and effort required to construct 
stochastic models increases along with the time required to generate real­izations of these processes 
during simulation experiments. Our objective in this situation is to, therefore, select the Sun Ewe Lim

paper we focus on arrival (counting) processes, and more particularly, arrival processes that can be 
classi.ed as nonstationary point processes. For such processes we are able to observe each arrival time 
exactly, and in gen­eral the arrival intensity (rate) changes over time. Under certain assumptions a 
nonstationary arrival process can be represented as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) (C¸ inlar, 
1975). Using NHPPs, we can accurately represent a large class of arrival processes encountered in practice. 
An NHPP {N(t) :t .0}given by N(t) = # of arrivals in [0,t] for all t .0 is a generalization of the Poisson 
process in which the instantaneous arrival rate a(t) at time t is a nonnegative integrable function of 
time. The mean-value function of the NHPP is de.ned by µ(t) =E[N(t)] for all t .0; and the relationship 
between the rate function and the mean­value function is t E[N(t)]=a(z) dz for all t .0. 0 The probabilistic 
behavior of the NHPP is completely de.ned by the rate or mean-value functions. The litera­ture in this 
area includes both parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating the NHPP rate function. To model 
ar­rival processes having several periodic effects or a long-term trend (or both), Kuhl, Wilson, and 
Johnson (1997) utilized an NHPP having an exponential-polynomial-trigonometric with multiple periodicities 
(EPTMP). The EPTMP-type rate function has the form a(t) =exp{h(t;m, p, .)},t E[0,S], (1) 462 Kuhl and 
Lim with mp h(t;m,p,.) = >iti + .k sin(wkt + k), i=0 k=1 where . =[>0,>1,...,>m,.1,...,.p, 1,..., p,w1,...,wp] 
is the vector of continuous parameters. Kuhl, Wilson, and Johnson (1997) present a maximum likelihood 
estimation procedure to .t the rate function a(t) to the observed arrivals over the time interval [0,S]. 
The problem inherent to this methodology is that as the changing arrival rate becomes more complex, so 
does the NHPP model. Moreover, the computational time required to estimate the parameters of the rate 
function increases dramatically as the complexity increases. Therefore, in attempt to minimize the amount 
of work required, we propose to determine the degree of accuracy to which the rate function parameters 
of the NHPP need to be estimated such that the simulation output performance measures are not signi.cantly 
different from performance measures that would be obtained for the underlying (true) process.  METHODOLOGY 
 The objective of this research is to perform a sensitivity analysis on the output performance measures 
of simulation experiments in order to determine the degree of accuracy to which the parameters of nonhomogeneous 
Poisson pro­cesses having an EPTMP-type rate function must be esti­mated. That is, we want to determine 
the maximum relative change in the parameters of the rate function that will yield simulation output 
performance measures that are not signif­icantly different than output performance measures of the underlying 
NHPP. By doing this, we will be able to estab­lish the amount of relative error allowable in estimating 
the parameters of the NHPP from observed data. The sensitivity analysis will be conducted using a sim­ulation 
model of a single server queueing system. The underlying arrival process will be a nonhomogeneous Pois­son 
process with an EPTMP-type rate function of the form (1). Using this type of rate function, we will be 
able to model NHPPs having long term trend and one or more cyclic components. The single server will 
be modeled using an exponential service time with a constant service rate. The queueing discipline employed 
will be .rst-in-.rst-out. The sensitivity analysis will concentrate on .ve output performance measures 
including (a) the number of entities in the system, L; (b) the number of entities in the queue, Lq; (c) 
the total time an entity spends in the system, W; (d) the time an entity spend waiting in the queue, 
Wq; and  (e) the utilization of the server, ..  Several NHPP models will be selected with varying long 
term trends and cyclic components. Since for these types of queueing systems, there is no general closed 
form analytical solution for calculating the theoretical values of the performance measures, we .rst 
need to simulate the queueing system to estimate each of the output performance measures. Upon doing 
this, we then vary the parameters of the NHPP rate function to determine the maximum relative variation 
that will result in the performance measures that are not signi.cantly different than the performance 
measures obtained using the original rate function parameters. To determine if the output performance 
measures ob­tained under the NHPPs with varied rate function parameters are different from the performance 
measures obtained un­der the original parameters, the standard statistical test for testing the difference 
between two means will be employed. Here we will use a signi.cance level of > =0.05. To show that this 
type of sensitivity analysis can pro­vide meaningful results, we have conducted the following preliminary 
study. 3 PRELIMINARY STUDY This preliminary study was conducted to show that this method sensitivity 
analysis produces meaningful result in a case where the theoretical results are known. This analysis 
involves a simulation model of the above single server queueing system utilizing a Poisson arrival process 
with a constant average arrival rate. Thus the theoretical output performance measures are those associated 
with the M/M/1 queueing model (Gross and Harris, 1985). For this analysis, we used a server utilization 
of . =0.5 by setting the arrival rate a = 0.5 arrival per time unit and a mean service time of µ = 1 
time unit. Based on these parameters, Table 1 lists the theoretical values of the performance measures.

 After building the simulation model of the above queueing system, we determined an appropriate warm-up 
period (1000 time units), an appropriate replication length (5000 time units), and an appropriate number 
of replications (2000 replications) in order to obtain results that approached the theoretical values. 
We then constructed 95% con.dence intervals for each output performance measure. These result are shown 
in Tables 2 6. Note that in each case the 463 Sensitivity Analysis of Simulation Output to Parameters

 theoretical value is well within the limits of the con.dence interval. The next step was vary the arrival 
rate a (both in­creasing and decreasing the parameter) to determine .rst the maximum relative variation 
resulting in the theoretical value falling outside of the con.dence interval indicating a signi.cant 
difference; and second the maximum relative variation resulting in signi.cant differences between the 
results and those obtained for the simulation of the system using the original value of the parameter. 
The results of this preliminary study are shown in Tables 2 6. In general, these tables show that as 
the relative change in the arrival rate increases, the simulation output performance measures diverge 
from their theoretical values. For example, the 95% con.dence interval on the average number of entities 
in the system shown in Table 2 includes the theoretical value of L= 1 for the original case where the 
arrival rate is known and for the cases where the arrival rate has been increased by up to 0.19 percent. 
However, when the arrival rate is increased beyond 0.20 percent, the con.dence intervals do not include 
the theoretical value which indicates that the average number of customers in the system for the simulation 
model is signi.cantly different from the theoretical value. However, for more complex arrival processes 
such as the NHPP, we cannot, in general, calculate the theoretical values of the output performance measures. 
Therefore, we will have to compare the simulated results of models having varied arrival process parameters 
with the simulated results of models having the original (known) arrival process parameters. Table 2 
shows that as the arrival rate is increased beyond 0.500 percent, the con.dence intervals for Ldo not 
overlap with the con.dence interval constructed under the original parameter which indicates a signi.cant 
difference in the resulting output performance measure. Similar types of results are seen in Tables 3 
6 for the other performance measures of interest. In general for the case of the M/M/1 queueing system 
model, these results indicate that a variation in the parameter beyond 0.500 464 Kuhl and Lim percent 
will result in output performance measures that are signi.cantly different that those of the original 
system. Thus, this study has shown that sensitivity analysis of the output performance measures can help 
to establish the allowable estimation error of the parameters of arrival process models. The next section, 
outlines an sensitivity analysis in­volving arrival processes that can be modeled as nonhomo­geneous 
Poisson processes. 4 CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDY We are currently conducting the proposed sensitivity 
analysis of a group to NHPPs having EPTMP-type rate functions of the from (1). The analysis is being 
conducted on a selected group of rate functions having long term tend and cyclic behavior. The long term 
trend is represented in the exponent of the rate function by polynomials up to degree four and the cyclic 
components are represented in the exponent by trigonometric terms. The test cases have up to four periodic 
components of varying periods. This experimental procedure will involve using the com­puter program mp3sim 
from Kuhl, Wilson and Johnson (1997) to generate the arrival times of entities in the simu­lation model. 
A constant service rate will be used during each replication. The service rate will be adjusted for dif­ferent 
rate functions so that we can determine the effects on the output measures at different traf.c intensities. 
We will adjust the service rate to achieve low (. . 0.2), moderate (. . 0.5), and high (. . 0.8) traf.c 
intensities. 5 SUMMARY Knowing the accuracy to which parameters of an NHPP rate function need to be 
estimated has two main bene.ts. First, the analyst can have con.dence in the model (or at least in the 
model of the arrival process). Second, the analyst has a basis for making judgments about the quality 
of the .tted arrival process model. That is, one can determine if the current model will be adequate 
or if more time and effort needs to be spent to achieve more accurate estimates of the arrival process 
parameters. Thus, this paper has provided a procedure for conduct­ing a sensitivity analysis of output 
performance measures with regard to the accuracy of the rate function parameters of NHPP arrival processes. 
The preliminary study has shown that this type of sensitivity analysis can provide information of the 
quality of the estimates that need to be achieved in order to obtain results from the simulation model 
that are not signi.cantly different from the results that would be obtained if the parameters were known. 
The current exper­imental study will involve a sensitivity analysis of output performance measure involving 
simulation models having arrival processes that can be modeled using NHPP having an EPTMP-type rate function. 
Moreover, this sensitivity analysis can provide some guidance to the analyst about the effects of the 
relative accuracy of input models has on the output performance measure of simulation experiments.
