networks, for instance the KSR-I and Hector multiprocessors follow a ring top.elegy. Moreover, recent 
interconnects such as the Scalable "Coherence Interface tSC.I) and the GigaRing.support the ring topology. 
This is ally surorising since the rmc, tODOIogv is cheap from an implemenfat!on perspec.tive. "1~. e

the most fatal disadvanVages of large-scale tings. With a fixed node degree, a low cost, symmetric properties, 
and a simple routing scheme [1, 3], the HR topology is very suitabre for smaTl-scale to large- scale 
ded~catelY multicomputer systems as well as "for parallel processing on networks of workstations. (NOWs).

using ~ipelinea comn?unication .is presenteu in sectiop m. ~ne mouet is evaluated, and the results are 
analyzed in section IV. We continue me paper in section V. 2. The Hyper-Ring and Multi-Ring Topologies 
In this section, we briefly , review . the constructions of the HR and MR. m me simplest case, both MRI(NI) 
and HRI(NI) are each a regular ring of N 1 nodes labeled 0 to (NI-1) in a clockwise direction as depicted 
in Fig. 1. To build an MR2(N1, N2) from an MRI(NI), N 2 MRI'S are duplicated and labeled 0 to (N 2 -1) 
in a clockwise direction as shown in Fig. 2. The nodes in each MRI are now labeled with the MRI number 
concatenated with the node's number in the MR 1. The HR2(N 1, N2) follows the same construction steps 
as the MR2(NI, N2) but adds the following. The N2 HRI's in the HR2(N 1, N2) are interconnected together 
on a higher ring dimension (dimension 2) via nodes X0 and XLN~/2J, where X represents donrt care. In 
this fashion, the HR 1 rings are interconnected together over a dual ring rather than a single ring to 
reduce the network congestion and improve tlie network's fault tolerance and bisection width. This is 
repeated as the dimension i of HR i is increased except that the nodes of the HR2's interconnect to a 
higher dimension d (where 3<--d<=i) via gateway nodes X...XYI and X...XY(LNt/2/+ 1) where Y spans all 
the HRl's and is given by Yfd- 3. For instance, the nodes of each HR 2 in a HR i (where i>--4) interconnect 
to dimension 4 via nodes XXI! and Xxi(L.Ni/2J + 1). Note that .the dual gateway nodes are distributed 
uniformly over me HR 1 rings to reduce the network congestion. Thus an i-dimensional HR i (Nl, N 2 ..... 
Ni. 1, Ni) is constructed by interconnecting the gateway nodes of N i HRi.I(NI, N2, I This paper does

the MR3(6 , 4, 4) and HR3(6, 4, 4). Generally, the node labels in HR i are i digits long starting with 
the label (i-I digits long) of the HR 1 to which the nodes belong followed by the node's number in that 
HR 1. This can be repeated until the top-most hierarchy (HRi.I) is reached. For instance, in Fig. 3, 
the 4 HR2's of the HR3(6, 4, 4) are labeled 0, ..., 3 in a clockwise fashion. The HR 1 rings in the bottom 
left HR 2 (labeled 3) are labeled 30 ..... 33 in an clockwise direction. The nodes of the HR 1 ring (labeled 
32) at the bottom of the HR 2 labeled 3 are labeled 320, ..., 325 in a clockwise increasing fashion. 
The HR is symmetric an.d can be simply adapted to mtercormect networks o[ workstations. The number or 
nodes in the HR i (NI, N 2 ..... N i) is M=-N 1 x N 2 x ... x N i. l~.e diameter and bisection width 
of the HR are provided in 3. Performance Modeling ['" . In this section, we review the verformance model 
z] ~or HRs and MRs which assumed'store-and-forward communication and and modify it for I~ipelinedcommunication. 
The average latencies (tal t4~ and t,~l vtp) are given in [2]. The model computes-t~;f'0~ the a~,'~rag'""e 
time a.m.essage wai~ in ~e me.ssage queue of a node's ne~worg unenace um[ [or me unk to oe available 
at time step i as a function of: (a) l, the avergge number of. packets per message, e~n packet,or mength~-64 
bits,,; (b.) tt,.the transfer ume or one packet over one tim< 0ncluaina message processing time); (c) 
tf, the flight time of one bR over one link; and (d) nw(O , the ave.rage number of messages ~ead inthe 
message queue at time step i. nw(i) isexpresseo ~ a run. ct.ion of'nw'(i-l), the average numoer or messages 
aneaa in the queue in the previous tmme step i- 1, and 2, the arrival rate of messages in messages per 
cycle.. It is assumed .that a node c.an send two mes.sages sunultaneously over the two links that are 
connected to it and that the time step is at least as large as the time needed for sending one message 
(tf + l x. tt). In pipelinedcommunication, given thai the ave.r~e distance traveled by a message of 1 
packets is tal, the time needed for the message to reach its destination is tal x (tf+tt)+ tt x (1 -l). 
Assuming the pipelined communication transport and a uniform ~listributmon of messages over the HR (and 
MR), and accounting for messages in transit, 2 in the HR and MR is given 15y 2H/~+..L.x( ~ NI-2i+ 1 ÷

se-nd, or receive instruction and is given by (l'Prw "Ps "Pr); t_ , ts, t r, and t/g U which represent 
the execution times ott'~ read or write, send, receive, or ALU (Le. none of the first 3 types) instruction, 
respectively; t c and tM, the times needed for a cache access and a memory access, respectively; tn, 
the bus access time; Phit and (1 -Phit ) which represent the hit and miss ratios of the cache, ~, the 
time to read from or write into the message queue in e node s interface unit. Next, the model computes 
twes, the average waiting time till the rues .sgge leaves the remote node thai" executes the send instruction~ 
as a function of tw(i), and twt s the average waiting tnne till the send instruction is executed in the 
remote node. Having determined ti, the system efficiency which expresses the ratio of the time of "useful" 
work over the time of the to.tal work (including communication agd memory overnead times) is computed. 
In fact, the efficiency is just the inverse of t i tunes a constant. This efficiency reflects, the .a.m.ount 
of communication and memory overhead recurred m HR(MR) sy.stems. The onl X umerences netween me penormance 
moae~s [or HR and MR are reflected by the use of tal, H R and 2 HR. (when assuming the uniform message 
~tffffiibution) for HR, instead of t,,t~a ~ and ~ for MR. 4. Evaluation Methodology and Results In this 
section, we evaluate the model described in the previous section and present and analyze the results. 
Prw , Ps, and Pr were assumed to be 0.4, 0.05, 0.05. Thereforep~ U was assumed to be 0.5 The cache hit 
time Phit was assumed to be 0.9. Pa, Pb, and Pc were assumed to be 0.5, 0:25, 0.25. Also, the following 
assumptions were made: tt--6~0 cycles, tf=50 cycles, t~ U = 1 cycle, tq = t C = 2 cycles, t M = t n ---4 
cycles, and twt s = 5 cycles. The model evaluation methodolot, v went as follows. First, n, the dimension

hierarchy increases from l to ~, the p-speedups of HRn(Y,...,Y), Ye{4, 8, 16, .32}, increase. This can 
be attributed to the fact that as n increases, the total number of nodes M increases thereby increasing 
the average latency tal which in turn increases I: which consequently reduces Eft. For lar~er n's, the 
efficiencies are smaller and thus even a tiny cfi'ange in the E ' at these larger values of n causes 
:.8" s of HR o and HRno the ratio of the Effs (i.d.. the p-speedup) to grow more than for smaller values 
of ,. The p-speedups for tCo,,,~te a (Figs. 4.a and 4.b).and 1 <=10 .4 (Figs. 4.i and. 4.j) increase 
more abruptly as n is increased, followed by the p- speedups for t=0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. 
For =~).01 and 0. l, ~e p-speedup.is al.most a constant and is anove i conn.rmlng mat wnen.the ne .t.wor.k
