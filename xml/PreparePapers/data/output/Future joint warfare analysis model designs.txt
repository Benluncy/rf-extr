Washington, DC 20301-1800, U.S.A. ABSTRACT The Joint Warfare System (JWARS) is a state-of-the-art simulation 
of joint warfare for analysis to be developed as one component of the Joint Analytic Model Improvement 
Program recently approved by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. This paper describes the rationale, objective, 
management, approach, and status of JWARS. 1 RATIONALE Existing models and simulations (M&#38;S) employed 
for analysis by the Department of Defense (DoD) are limited in their representations of joint operations 
and consequently limited in their ability to address current issues. Figure 1 shows recent analytic applications 
of theater-level M&#38;S. In the area of planning and programming, studies included those assisting in 
determining the size of the Base Force and the Bottom Up Review (BUR) Force, the Mobility Requirement 
Study Bottom Up Review Update (MRS BURU) study, the Nimble Dancer seminar war game, and the family of 
Joint Warfare Capability Assessments (JWCAS). Modernization assessments included the Joint Advanced Strike 
Technology (JAST) study and the Heavy Bomber / B-2 Study. Operational assessments supported Operation 
Desert Storm, Vigilant Warrior (the operation associated with the threatened Iraqi attack in October 
1994), Commander-in-Chief (CINC) force allocation, and alternatives for dealing the situation in Bosnia. 
Figure 1 also shows current model limitations. Areas are color coded regarding adequacy of representation: 
G=green for good, Y=Yellow for fair, and R=red for poor. In May 1995, the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
(DepSecDef) approved the Joint Analytic Model Improvement Program (JAMIP) to improve the ability of the 
DoD to address joint operations. The four phases of JAMIP are displayed in Figure 2. JWARS makes up Jim 
Metzger Director, JWARS Office Office of the Director (Program Analysis and Evaluation) 1800 Defense 
Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-1800, U.S.A. the second and third phases and is the topic of this paper. 
The second ( mid term ) phase is the design and development of JWARS. The third ( long term ) phase is 
incorporation of JWARS into the city architecture proposed by the Director, Defense Research and Engineering 
(DDR&#38;E) and supported by the High Level Architecture (HLA) being defined under the leadership of 
the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO). That city architecture , illustrated in Figure 3, 
involves the development by DMSO of a common technical ffamework that provides services to M&#38;S in 
diverse areas--production and logistics (P&#38;L), test and evaluation (T&#38;E), analysis, and research 
and development (R&#38;D)--and the development of M&#38;S that adhere to HLA precepts and can thereby 
avail themselves of those services and, as appropriate, operate in conjunction with one another. 2 OBJECTIVE 
The objective of JWARS is to develop a state-of-the-art simulation of joint warfare for analysis. Applications 
will include: development of war plans and evaluation of courses of action, analyses of force structure 
alternatives, analyses of force structure alternatives. mission area analyses, JWCAS, determination of 
requirements for new warfighting capabilities, analyses of weapon system alternatives (in particular, 
cost and operational effectiveness analyses), and evaluation of alternatives for program and budget reviews. 
 3 MANAGEMENT The management structure for JAMIP, including JWARS, is shown in Figure 4. The JAMIP executive 
committee provides overall guidance and ensures proper fimding. Control of JWARS is exercised by the 
JAMIP steering committee, which adheres to the guidance of the 1164 Future Joint Warfare Analysis Model

these committees. Organizationally, the JWARS office is an element of the Plans and Program Analysis 
Support Center, a DoD support activity reporting to the Director, Program Analysis and Evaluation (DPA&#38;E). 
4 APPROACH The approach to be taken in developing JWARS is illustrated in Figure 5. The development is 
driven by user requirements being collected and prioritized by the Joint M&#38;S Requirements Group led 
by the Joint Staff/J­ 8. Several of the initial JWARS tasks warrant emphasis­ -Tasks 2-3. Prepare high 
level and detailed designs for JWARS. It is anticipated that JWARS will be object-oriented. -Task 4. 
Build a prototype of JWARS. -Task 7. Demonstrate the federation of JWARS with a mobility/logistics simulation 
prototype. This activity supports the definition of HLA by DMSO. The initial schedule for JWARS development 
is shown in Figure 6. The immediate milestones are completion of the high level design by December 1995, 
completion of the prototypes by March 1996, and demonstration of federation of prototypes by June 1996. 
Management 5 STATUS JWARS development began in May 1995 after approval of JAMIP by the DepSecDef. By 
the time of the 1995 Winter Simulation Conference, the high level design will be nearing completion, 
and building of prototypes will have begun. Details on these activities will be reported at the conference.
