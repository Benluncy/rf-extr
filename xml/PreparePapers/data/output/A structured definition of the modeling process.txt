45401 ABSTRACT This research uses tbe IDEFO methodology to develop a structured functional model of 
the modeling process. It ties together multiple views of this process from current literature and field 
experience from successful modeling projects. Ihe motivation for this project is to describe the process 
for discrete event simulation models, but the process can be used for other modeling techniques. The 
basis for this work was a panel discussion at the 1991 Winter Simulation Conference. (Pritsker, 91). 
This formal representation of the modeling process offers opportunities for fhrther research to refine 
the art of problem resolution using models. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper provides a structured representation 
of the modeling process. The idea for this work stemmed from a figure describing how a model is used 
to solve a problem (Ritsker, 91) in a format similar to IDEFO process modeling (ICAM, 81). The figure 
described inputs, constraints, resources, and outputs for the modeling process. This global definition 
of the modeling problem-solving process at the highest level prompted a search for a structured representation 
of the modeling process. The authors each had process definitions they used in day-to-day modeling work, 
but these had been developed ad hoc and did not provide a structured definition. Such a definition could 
be used as a benchmark for other reaea.mhers as well as a base for teaching the modeling proeeas. A search 
of the pertinent literature mveded only one reference to a functional model of the modeling process using 
the IDEFO methodology (Wichmann, 90). Wichmann developed an IDEFO model to explain his methodology for 
a simulation-based scheduler. Wichmann did not expand his fictional model for neither the general case 
nor the detailed case, as this was not the focus of his paper. This paper decomposes a top-level modeling 
process description into more detailed descriptions. It incorporates recommen&#38;tions from prior model 
process descriptions. The process model as described here is being used for commercial applications (Withers, 
92). 2 BACKGROUND The modeling process for simulation is well documented. Most simulation texts devote 
a section or chapter to the process that surrounds the prog ramming of the model. These brief overviews 
of the modeling process do not provide the reader with an achxquate focus for the other activities in 
the problem-solving process. Typically only 30 -40% of the total effort in most successful simulations 
studies is spent doing the actual coding (Law, 91). This is supported by Mussehnan who suggests one spend 
more time modeling and experimenting than building the actual model (Musselman, 92). Genend texts on 
model building abound; two are notable in the context of this paper, (Rivett, 80) for a practical approach 
and (Ziegler, 84) for anew objectariented approach. In our research, we have developed a model of the 
modeling process baaed on the simulation literature. However the model developed has general characteristics 
suitable for other types of analysislumummication such as optimhtion, spreadsheet, and visualimtion. 
We have reviewed recent publications that included an outline of the modeling process and summarized 
the steps they recommen d as shown in Table 1. (Muaselman,92), (l%itaker, 89), (Lsw,91), and (Balci,90). 
Both a first and second level of detail for our recommended modeling process are shown as the first two 
cdurnns of Table 1. Muaselmsn probably has the most direct view of what steps should be involved in a 
modelinglsimulation project. Although Muasehnan did not discuss these steps at length it is a good place 
1109 1110 Withers, Pritsker, for us to start to look at what functions are involved in the modeling process. 
Pritsker, Sigal, and H ammesfahr describe their steps in detail and add an experimental control step 
after validation to Mussehnan s view of the modeling process. Law adds another validation step after 
the conceptual model has been built. Balci adds four new steps including a feasibility assessment before 
the project is started. He adds a system investigation step after problem formulation, and Balci also 
suggmts an investigation of solution techniques before coding begins. In addition, Balci recommends that 
the model can be redefined so that it can be used again. At the general level, all of the suggested 
steps are included in our model. A key step we added is an independent assessment, which the Department 
of Defense (DoD) feels is an important aspect of modeling. The DoD has spent over $250 million for quantitative 
studies since 1980... The General Accounting Office suggests that a formrd evaluation procedure be applied 
to the analysis and the related model may soon become commonplace. , (Fossett, 91). 3 IDEFO MODELING 
METHODOLOGY IDEFO is a modeling technique used frequently in Computer Integrated Manufacturing systems 
analysis to get a good understanding of the system before process re-engineering begins. We feel that 
it is a good way to represent the modeling process itself. IDEFO is a formal method to define a subprocess 
in a manner that further defines higher level processes. Function Nodes as shown in Figure 1 are the 
focus of this methodology. A node is an activity or function that transforms inputs to outputa under

additional using For information on IDEFO modeling, see (ICAM, 81). and Withers 4 THE MODELING PROCESS 
DESCRIPTION The formal representation of the process is presented as IDEFO diagrams in Figures 2 through 
9. The first two levels of decomposition are mmmwizd in Table 1 to align this process definition to prior 
work. We describe the high-level activities in the next section, and refer the interested reader to a 
complete report (Withers, 93) for a decomposition to all the individual activities. Withers also includes 
a descriptive glossary of all activities and information flows. Note in Table 1 that none of the prior 
process descriptions included all of the required steps. Additionally, a key step has been added as shown 
in Figure 9, ASSESS USE of MODEL. This step allows a comparison of performance measures from the operational 
system and the model to improve the system. This step also gives an independent assessment of the usefulness 
of the model. 4.1 Key Activities in the Modeling Process A good way to examine the main steps of our 
structured definition of the modeling process is to look at the Figure 4. The major process steps: UNDERSTAND 
SYSTEM and CUSTOMER, PRODUCE CONCEPTUAL MODEL, PRODUCE MODEL, USE MODEL, and ASSESS MODEL USE are shown 
in this figure. The modeling process begins with the step UNDERSTAND SYSTEM and CUSTOMER. In thiS step 
the modeling team, the customer, and management examine the information about the system. The customer 
requirements and resource constraints are considered and the problem to be solved is defined, The output 
of this process step is a definition of the system, a contract, and a statement of work. The system definition 
is used as an input to PRODUCE CONCEPTUAL MODEL. Ilk step is where the customer and modeling team work 
together to define model objectives, a conceptual model, and data requirements for the model. A conceptual 
model is developed to ensure the modeling team has an accurate understanding of the system to be modeled. 
The output of this process is an approved conceptual model, any changes to the customer contract, and 
possibly some understanding of the system that would cause the custormx make a change in the system. 
The approved conceptual model is the main input to PRODUCE MODEL. In addition to the actual model pro 
-gp them we a number of other activities in this step. Before programming g begins, A Structured Definition

Withers, Pritsker, the claw of model is determined to see if simulation is the right way to address the 
problem or whether another modeling method would provide a better solution. Once programming and documentation 
are complete, the model is verified to apxifications and validated to requirements, which includes an 
output analysis. Finally the model is released to be used for system analysis. The released model is 
a key input to the USE MODEL p~. In this step, experiments are designed and carried out using the model 
to estimate how the red system would respond to various changes. The result of the experimentation is 
analyzed and alternatives are developed for how to improve the system. The end result of this step is 
the decision as to how to alter the system to improve performance. Once the initial study has been completed, 
the model can be used to compare predicted to actual operational performance. This cmnparison is described 
in the ASSESS MODEL USE activity. An assessment is made on the value, adequacy and utility of the model. 
 5 VALIDATION OF THE PROCESS DESCRIPTION The representation given here is baaed on a summary of noted 
prior work by practitioners and researc hers in simulation modeling. It has been enhanced by practical 
experiences in problem solving. At this time, validation of the model has been accomplished solely by 
the authors who represent users (non­academic) of the technology. 6 CONCLUSION A functional model of 
the modeling process is presented as a benchmark for use in practice, research, and teaching, and as 
a base for continuous improvement for those involved in building and using models. The authors solicit 
comments and will present updated models if wiirrsnted, This formal representation of the modeling process 
offers opportunities for fiwther research to refine the art of problem resolution using models. REFERENCES
