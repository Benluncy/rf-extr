 Maximization Problems on Graphs witn Edge weights Chosen from a t~ormal Distribution ( EXT~2~DED ABSTRACT) 
 by George S. Lueker+ Deparbment of Information and Computer Science University of California, Irvine 
Irvine, California 92717 Abstract we consider optimization problems on complete graphs with edge weights 
chosen from identical but independent normal distributions. We show some very general techniques £or 
obtaining upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic behavior of these problems. Often, but not always, 
these bounds are equal, enabling us to state the asymptotic behavior of the maximum. Problems in which 
the bounds are tight include finding the optimum traveling salesman tour, finding a minimum cost spanning 
tree, and finding a heaviest clique on k vertices. We then discuss some greedy heuristic algorithas for 
these problems. i. Introduction ~ly results have been proven about the properties of randcm graphs. 
Some of these [ER59, ER66, Ma70, GM75, BE75, Po76, AV77, Wa77a] deal with graphs constructed by letting 
edges be present or absent according to some distribution. Another area of interest is algorit~s on weighted 
graphs. For example, if a traveling salesman problem is constructed using the Euclidean distance between 
n points chosen from a uni£orm distribution in the unit square, then asymptotically the maximum solution 
is proportional to Vf~n [BHH59] ; a very e£ficient algorithm has been designed whose expected behavior 
is asymptotically optimal [Ka76]. The assignment problem for the case in which weights are chosen from 
a uniform distribution has been studied by several people [Ku62, Do69, Wa77b] ; +Supported by the National 
Science Foundation under Grant MCS77-04410. Donath [Do69] has also considered the case in which the 
edge weights have a value x in [0,1] with probability proportional to x k for some k. In this paper we 
investigate the behavior of a number of optimization problems on complete graphs with edge weights chosen 
independently from a normal distr ibut ion. We shall often use random variables chosen from a normal 
distribution with mean 0 and variance i. Such a variable will be called a unit normal variable. ~br 
convenience, we shall let f (respectively F) be the corresponding probability density function (respectively 
probability distriDution £unction). ~hus f(x) = (2 ~)-i/2 e-X2/2 F(x) = f(t) dt f We will often be 
making statements about the asymptotic behavior of f~ctions. Tne following definitions will be assumed. 
 f(x) ~ g(x) <==> f(x)-g(x) = o(g(x)) f(x) < g(x) <==> max(f(x)-g(x),0) = o(g(x)) f(x) > g(x) <==> 
max(g(x)-f(x),0) = o(g(x)) Note t/~at £(x) < g(x) and f(x) > g(x) ==> f(x) ~ g(x). Also we will frequently 
discuss probabilities and expected values. If X is a randan variable and A and B are events, let P{A} 
be the probability of A, P{AIB} be the probability of A given B, E[X] be the expected value of X, and 
E[XIA] be the expected value of X given A. -13 - The following few observations, which are well-known 
or easily established, are useful. Fact i. As r -> 0, a) f-l(r) ~ + /2 log r -I' b) F -l(r) ~ - /2 
log r -~-" C) F -l(1-r) ~ /2 log r -l' Fact 2. Let X be a unit normal variable and let A be an event 
which happens with probability p. %hen as p-> 8, a) l~x I All < /2 log p-l." b) ~.[IXl I A] < /2 log 
p-l[ Proof sketch. For part (a), clearly the quantity in question will be maximized if the event A has 
the form "X>a" for some a; it is not hard to show that even in this case the bound holds. A similar argument 
holds for part (b). [] Fact 3. Let X be a random variable which max is formed by taking the maximum 
of n unit normal variables. ~hen E[%ax] ~ /2 log n 3. Moreover, for any e>0,  f _he/2 P{Xma x < ~2(l-e) 
log n } < e (i) Proof sketch. We will only prove that (i) holds. Let M(x) = P{X . <x} ~hen m~-° L~l(x) 
= [F(x)]n. Let a = VF2(l-e) log"' n . As n->(D (and hence a->0o), we have F(a) = 1 - a -I f(a) (i + 
O(a -2) (See [Fe68, p. 175].) Thus, M(a) ~ [i - a -I f(a)(i + O(a-2))] n -n a -I f(a) (i + O(a-2)) 
< e -n a -i (2~) -I/2 e-(l-e) log n (i + O(a-2)) = e -a -I (2,) -1/2 n e (i + O(a-2)) = e < e-n 
e/2 [] %nroughout this paper, G n will be a random variable which is a complete, undirected, weighted, 
 labeled grap~ on n vertices; we will asstrne the vertices are labeled 1,2,...,n. Weights are chosen, 
independently, from a normal distribution with meal 8 and variance i. (All of the results proved in t/~is 
paper can immediately be generalized to the case in which some other mean and variance are specified, 
provided these quantities are the same for all edges; we assune zero mean and u~it variance to minimize 
notation.) G will denote some partic~ular weighted complete graph. The weight of the edge connecting 
vertex v and w will be denoted  d (v,w) . I*_~t S n be a set of labeled graphs on n vertices; again, 
the vertices are labeled 1,2, ....,n, so there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the vertices 
of an element o£ S ~md the vertices o£ G . All elements of S n n n are assumed to have the same number 
o£ edges; call this nt~aber ran. For any H in Sn, and any weighted graph G, let W(G,H) be the nun~oer 
found by summing, over all edges in H, the weight of the corres~)nding edge in G. For a given G, we wish 
to choose H in S so as to maximize W(G,H); this n maximum will be called Wax (G). Note that, for example, 
if S n is the set of the (n-l)!/2 cycles on n vertices, Wax(G) gives the solution to the traveling salesman 
problem. We wish to investigate the expected behavior of Wmax(Gn). (Often in an optimization problem, 
we wish to minimize some quantity; for uniformity, however, we will always assume that we are maximizing 
quantities. She results obtained here will, by symmetry, irm~ediately carry over to the corresponding 
mlnimization probl~a. ) In section 2, we will discuss a very general tecnnique for obtaining upper bot~Ids 
on the expected values of maximugt solutions to such problems. Section 3 discusses a very general technic91e 
for obtaining lower bounds on these expect£<1 values; it turns out that combining the bounds of sections 
2 and 3 often enables us to make rather precise statements about the asymptotic behavior of the expected 
maximem, as will be shown in section 4. In section 5 we will investigate the behavior of some simple 
algorit~ns for some of these problems.  2. An ~pper bound. Let P*n = ISnl; throughout this paper, we 
assure t/nat iim ~*n = ~" For example, if we n --> Go are dealing with the traveling salesman problem, 
then i~i = (n-l)!/2. (Note that since our graphs n are labeled, we can distinguish the elements of S 
 n even though they are all isomorphic.) The result of this section will establish that E[Wax cannot 
be ],. much less than ~ 2 m n log M The method used is to examine the tail of the distribution of total 
weights of instances of H in %. A similar idea was used by Donath in obtaining a lower bound on the 
solution to the assignment problem over n by n matrices whose col~nns are random permutations of the 
integers 1 to n [Do69]. ~lhere it was viewed as an enu~neration argument; here the random elements are 
drawn from a continuous distribution so the argument has a somewhat dif£erent flavor. Let ~ be a new 
random variable which is n ~ormed Dy choosing an element of Sn; each element is cnosen witn equal probability. 
When both n n and G n appear in m~ expression, we asst~ne they are Chosen independently. Theorem 1. 
E[Wma (Gn) ] < /2 m n log x Mn'. Proof. We begin by showing that E [Wma x (Gn) ] = (2) E [W(Gn,Hn) 
I~ (Gn,Hn) =Wmax (Gn) ]. To see this, note that E [W(Gn,B n) IW(Gn,Sn) =Wma x (Gn)]  = E [Wax (Gn) 
l W (G n ,H n) =Wma x (G n) ] (3) Now clearly for any G, at least one H e S n satisfies W(Gn,H)=Wmax(Gn); 
on the other hand, the set o£ G for which more than one H @ S is n maxLnal forms a space of measure 
zero. rihus for almost any G, the probability of W(G,Hn)=Wma x (G) is precisely t.< I. Since this is 
independent of G, it follows that the right side of (3) is simply 5[Wma x (Gn) ]. For any H in Sn, 
W(Gn,H ) is simply the sun of m n unit nonaal variables; hence W(Gn,H ) has a normal distribution with 
mean 0 and variance m n" Since this is true for any H, W(Gn,Hn) must have this same distribution. Now 
W(%,Hn) = Wmax(Gn) is an event which, as noticed before, has probability Mnl; thus by (2) and the obvious 
generalization of Fact 2 to normal variables which have nonunit variance, the theorem is established. 
 [] 3. A lower bound. In this section we obtain an upper bound on ~[Nnax ] . ~any results have been 
obtained which demonstrate that £or sufficiently dense graphs, certain properties are very likely to 
occur. More formally, define a random variable G to be a n,p_ graph on n vertices, where each edge i~present 
with probability Pn' independently of the others. Given a real sequence Pn and a sequence S n of classes 
of subgraphs, let ~ be the probability that the graph ..G,p fails to contain an element of n %. ~hen, 
for example, it is known [Po76,AV77] that for any i, we can choose a c large enough so %=0 (n -i) if 
S n is the set of hamiltonian cycles on n vertices, and Pn = (c log n)/n. In this section, we establish 
a theorem which relates results of this form to the optimization ~roDl~ms we are considering. (A sL~ilar 
relationship was used independently by Walkup [wa77b], in a different context. ) Theorem 2. Suppose 
Qn goes to zero rapidly enough so that % /m n log Qn 1 = o(m n ~ n ) Then E[Wax ] > m n /2 log pn 
-I" Proof. Consider the following algorithm for choosing an element of Sn. i. Let a = F -I (l-Pn) 
, and let H be some fixed eleJnent of S . n 2. Let E De the set of edges in G whose weight is greater 
than a.  3. Let H be any element of S all of whose n edges are in E, and stop. If no such H can be 
found, go on to step 4. 4. let H = H. Note that if this algorithm stops at step 3, we surely have 
 W(G,H) > a mn, so by Fact i, W(G,H) > mn /2 log Pn -I  We must also consider the possibility that 
H is set to H in step 4, t/fat is, that no element of S n can be constructed from theedges in E; call 
this event FAIL. Now note that distribution of graphs obtained by choosing all edges of weight greater 
than F -I (I - pn ) is identical to --Gn,pn" %bUS the probability of FAIL is just %. By Fact 2, and 
the fact that W(Gn,H ) is normally distributed with variance mn, we may conclude that the expected weight 
of H in the event FAIL is O(~m log ~i'). Then by the hypotheses of the theorem, the error we commit by 
ignoring the possibility of event FAIL is negligible. [] 4. Some e~amples. We now consider several 
examples of the applications of Theorems 1 and 2. We shall often observe a happy occurence--the upper 
and lower bounds coincide, enabling us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the maximum solution. 
 we begin by considering the traveling saleeman ~SP  problem; W~a x (G) will denote the maximum weight 
traveling salesman tour in a weighted graph G. Theorem 1 easily gives an asymptotic upper bored of n 
~2 log n ~. On the other hand, it is known [Po76, AV77] that the probability that G fails  n,p_ to 
contain a hamiltonian cycle can be made £o be O(n ~x) , for any ~, by letting Pn = (c log n)/n, where 
c is large enough. Thus, by Theorem 2, E[W TSP(G )] > n /2 log ((c log n)/n)-i max - n n v/2 log 
n . lhus we easily obtain Corollary i. The expected maximum for the traveling salesnan problem is given 
by , .']SP ~ V/2 log n ~   Lt~(Gn)] n A very similar result is very easily establisned for the expected 
weight of the maximum cost spanning tree in G, denoted ~m~ (G). Corollary 2. E[~m~(%)] ~ n ~2 log n'. 
 Actually, the examples considered so far have not fully tested the power of Theorems 1 and 2. For both 
the %~P and the maximum cost spanning tree problem, the upper bound could have been obtained by simply 
calculating the expected total weight of the heaviest n or n-i edges. Also, as we shall see in ~.~ction 
5, the lower bound can be achieved by a very simple algorithm. The bounds achieved in the next example 
do not appear to be obtainable by such simple arguments. Consider the problem of finding the weight of 
the heaviest k-clique in a graph G, denoted W CLIQ(k) (G). (In the asymptotic max stat~mlents which 
follow, we assume that both k and n tend to infinity, Out n goes to infinity much taster than k.) First 
note that the number o£ edges in a k-clique is ~ k2/2. Further, the number of distinct k-cliques is C(n,k). 
~us an upper botu~d is Er~.CLIQ(k) /2(k2/2) log C(n,k)' t~ax (Gn) ] <- ~ k 312 V/log n'. (4) NOW the 
proof of-Theorem 1 in [GM75] can easily be adapted to show that if we let Pn n -2/(k+2) , then the probability 
that Gn, p fails to contain a k-clique is O(n -3/2) . Thus n ~heorem 2 gives ZLIQ(k) E[~nlax (Gn)] 
> (k2/2) /2 log n 2/(k+2)" -(k2/2) ~2 (2/(k+2)) log n -K 312 ~ (5) Combining (4) with (5), we get 
the following. Corollar}/ 3_: E ,T CLIQ (k) k3/2  L-m= (%)j - Finally, we give an example in which 
the upper and lower bounds guaranteed by Theorems 1 and 2 do not coincide. We will say a graph H has 
property  X(k) if a) H has a clique of size k, and b) H has k 2 edges. Consider the problem of finding 
the heaviest subgraph in G n whicn satisfies property X(k). It can be shown tnat neither the bound of 
~heorem 1 nor that of 'l~eorem 2 is tight; the details will not be pres~ited here. 5. Some algorithms. 
 In this section we investigate the expected behavior of some simple heuristic algorithms for the properties 
discussed in the preceding section. It is not hard to show that a very simple greedy algorithm for the 
TSP, which constructs a tour by starting at an arbitrary vertex and iteratively walking to the closest 
tmvisited vertex, achieves the expected asymptotic behavior described in Corollary i. ~he problem of 
finding the heaviest clique on k vertices is considerably more interesting. Consider the following greedy 
approach. procedure CLIQ_GRZED~ (G) ; C <- {an arbitrary vertex of G}; while ICl < k do be~in let 
v be the vertex not in C which maximizes the stml, over all w in C, of d(v,w); addv toC; end: return 
the total weight of all edges joining vertices of C; en_~d; Note that if we consider, for some fixed 
i, the i th pass through the loop, we are choosing the maximum of n-i independent sums of i unit normal 
variables. Unfortunately, tl]e i th pass through the loop is affected by the previous passes, which ccmplicates 
the analysis somewhat. However, an idea similar to that used in [ES74,C~76] is useful ~ere--we can simply 
eliminate all cases in which things don't work out as we like. More formally,  let us choose an e > 
0 and consider the probability that for any set C of vertices, ICl<k, ~ ~ d(v,w) < %/2 ICl (l-e) log 
(n- IC|)'  v~C w~C Using Fact 3, we see that for any fixed choice of C, this probability goes to zero 
fast enough to swallow polynomials. But, for fixed k, there are only polynemially many choices for C, 
so the sum of this probability, over all possible C with ICl<k, must go to zero fast enough to swallow 
polynomials; call this probability P(n,k). (Recall that we are letting n go to infinity much faster than 
k.) Accordingly, we conclude that the algorithm produces a clique o£ weight at least k-I ~q. ~ 2 i (l-e) 
log (n-i)" i=l  -k a/2 log n' except with probability P(n,k). But since P(n,k) vanishes so rapidly 
an argument like that in the proof of Theorem 2 tells us that the result is E [CLIQ_GREEDY (Gn) ] > 
! (8V~/9) k 3/2 / (i - e) log n . Since e may be arbitrarily small, we conclude that E [CLIQ_GREEDY 
(Gn) ] > ~ k 3/2 / log n '. It can be shown that this is in fact a tight description o£ the behavior 
of this algorit/~n; the details will not be presented here. Comparing with Corollary 3, we see that the 
average result of this algorithm deviates from the average maximum by less than 6 percent for n>>k>>l. 
It would be interesting to find an algorithm with optim~n average b~havio r. knowledgemen ts I am especially
