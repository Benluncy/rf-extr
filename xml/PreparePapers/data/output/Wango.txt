 Wango: COMPOST Team CADRE Wango: COMPOST (Compost) is an interactive system that places the audience 
in control of live video and audio feeds while they navigate through a real-time interface. The Wango 
Compost Processing Center (WCPC) combines data generated by portable recording technology attached to 
human vehicles called Decomposing Agents. At SIGGRAPH 97, these agents transmit audio/video information 
back across the Internet via the WCPC. Hosted by a virtual cyber-presence, both live and virtual attendees 
explore new ways of controlling media types through live interÂ­action. The primary goal is for people 
not physically in Los Angeles for SIGGRAPH 97 to be able to experience as much interaction as a person 
attending the conference.  CONTACT Cassandra Lehman The CADRE Institute San Jose State University One
