 Projective Representations for Energy Band Calculations Ray Head Computer Center, University of Arkansas 
 Introduction  For symmetry considerations in energy band calculations one needs to compute the irreducible 
representations of the group of the wave vector at a point inside or on the surface of the Brillouin 
zone. These symmetry considerations not only provide an effective mathematical tool for labeling the 
eigenvalues obtained but also enhance convergence, thereby reducing computer time re- quired for the 
calculation. The geometry of the crystal provides us with a 2-cocycle m of the associated point group 
G and the irreducible re- presentations of the group of the wave vector can be very easily obtained from 
projective represen- tations of G having the factor set ~. In the large majority of cases it can be shown 
that the group theoretical structure of G is such that the needed projective representations are all 
monomial, i.e. they can be induced from one- dimensional projective representations on certain subgroups 
of G. For these cases we present an inductive type algorithm which can be easily programmed for the actual 
computation. This paper is then divided into two sections. In Section I we more precisely state the 
relation between the irreducible representations of the group of the wave vector and the projective re- 
presentations of the associated point group and also develop needed machinery from the theory of projective 
representations. The algorithm is presented in Section II and the theorems required for its formulation 
are proved. I. Irreducible representations of the group of the ~ave vector  Let k be a point lying 
inside or on the sur- face of the Brillouin zone. The group of the wave vector G for k consists of all 
those elements from the space group of the crystal whose rotational parts leave k essentially _unchanged. 
That is, if (gla) is an element of G then gk = k + X for some reciprocal lattice vector X. The rotational 
parts g of the elements (gla) form a group called the associated point group. Our task is to find all 
the irreducible representations T of G which satisfy the condition T((elt))= ei(k,t)l for any primitive 
translation vector t. For descriptions of how these representations are used in various band calculations 
we refer the reader to 2, 12, and 14 in the references. Lyubarskii has provided a method of obtaining 
the irreducible representations of G from projec- tive representations of the associated point group. 
This method is presented in Theorem i. The re- mainder of this section is then devoted to a development 
of the theory needed to compute the projective representations and we begin with the following definitions. 
G will denote a finite group, K a field, and GL(M) the general linear group of a vector space M over 
K. K* will denote the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of K. Definition i: Let ~:G X G÷K* satisfy 
~(x,yz)m(y,z) = m(xy,z)m(x,y) for all x, y, z in G and m(e,x) = ~(x,e) = i for all x in G. The map is 
then called a 2-cocycle or factor set. If there is a map ~:G÷K* such that ~(x,y) = ~(x)~(y)/~(xy) for 
all x, y in G, m is called a 2-coboundary or splitting factor set. The grou~ of all cocycles will be 
 denoted Z2(G.K *) and its subgroup of co- boundaries BI(G,K*). The quotient groun Z2(G,K*~/ B2(G,K 
*) is the Schur multiplier H2(G,K~). Two J cocycles are said to be cohomologous if they lie in the same 
class of Z2(G,K *) modulo B2(G,K~). Definition 2: The map T:G~GL(M) is called a pro- jective representation 
of G having factor set if there is a map m:G X G-~K* such that T(e) = I and T(x)T(y) = ~(x,y)T(xy) for 
all x, y in G. T will be more briefly called an w-rep of G. The degree of T is the dimension of M over 
K. Two projective representations R and S of G are said to projectively equivalent if there is a map 
~:G÷K and a non-slngular linear transformation B such that R(g) = ~(g)B-iS(g)B for all g in G. If ~ is 
identically I, R and S are linearly equivalent. Essentially all the proof of Theorem i may be found 
in Lyubarskii, 8 pages 94-95. In Theorem i K will be the field of complex numbers. Theorem i: Let G 
be the group of the wave vector for the point k and let G be the associated point grouPi The map ~ on 
G X G defined by m(g,h) = ei(g-k-k,b), where (gla) and (hlb) are elements of ~, is an element of Z2(G,K*). 
Furthermore, if the representation S of G satisfies the condi- tion S((eIt)) = ei(k,t)l for all primitive 
trans- lations t, then there is a projective representa- tion T of G having factor set m such that S((gIa)) 
= ei(k,a)T(g) for all elements (gla) in G. Note that if k is inside the Brillouin zone we must have 
gk = k for all g in G. Thus m is  Proceedings of the 1976 ACM Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation 
126 trivial and the problem is reduced to finding the irreducible (ordinary) representations of G. In 
most cases where k is on the surface, however, 00 is a nonbounding cocycle. Definition 3: Let ~0 be an 
element of Z2(G,K *) and {a_} a set of elements in one-to-one correspon- dengce with the elements of 
G. Consider the set of all formal sums of the form ~E~Bgag where Bg is an element of K. We construct 
an algebra over K, called the 0J-group algebra 00KG, by defining (i) ~ Bgag + ~0gag = ~(~g + pg)ag, 
 (2)~(~8gag) = ~(~Bg)ag, and  (3) (Eg Bgag)(Epgag)=g tEYtat where Yt =  Bgpg-ltw(g, g-lt). Note that 
for g, h in G we have aga h = ~(g,h)ag h.  A module over the algebra mKG is called an mKG-module (unless 
otherwise stated our modules are left modules). If T:G+GL(M) is an 0~-rep of G then M is an 0~KG-module 
and T is called the m-rep of G afforded by M. Every mKG-module affords an m-rep of G. Finally, let T 
be the m-rep of G afforded by the 0~KG-module M. The map ~:G÷K given by #(g) = tr(T(g)) is called the 
character of G afforded by M. Definition 4: Let M be an ~0KG-module and N a K- subspace of M. N is called 
an mKG-subspace if a_n is an element of N for every n in N. An c0~G-module which has no proper 00KG-subspace 
is said to be an irreducible ~0KG-module. Other- wise the module is reducible. A completely reducible 
e0KG-module is the direct sum of irreducible 00KG-subspaces. These properties of ~KG-modules correspond 
naturally to certain properties of the 00-reps of G which they afford. If T is the 0~-rep of G afforded 
by the completely reducible 0~KG-module M, then T can be written in the form T(g) = [Ti~g) 0 ] with 
a suitable choice of T2(g) basis. A reducible 0~-rep T can be written in the form T(g) = and a a~-rep 
of G which T3(g) cannot be written in this manner is irreducible. Let us reiterate that we are trying 
to obtain certain projective representations of a finite grcup that have exactly the same factor set. 
Hence when we say that two ~-reps are equivalent we mean that they are linearly equivalent. We now present 
several theorems which will be needed for the algorithm in Section II. Proofs for these theorems may 
be filled in utilizing techniques from the theory of ordi- nary representations. To acquaint the reader 
with the type of conversion necessary, the proof of Theorem 2, which is the projective analog of Maschke's 
Theorem, is given. This proof was adapted from a proof for the ordinary case in Curtis and Reiner, 4 
pages 41-42. Theorem 2: Suppose that char(K) does not divide the order of G. If M is any mKG-module, 
M is completely reducible. Proof: Let T be the ~-rep of G afforded by M and let N be an ~KG-subspace 
of M. Let P:M÷N be the projection and define Q in HOMK(M,M) by i E 1 T(g)PT(g-l) Q =IGIg m(g-l g) Suppose 
that x is any element of G and consider T(x)Q. We have i i E T(x)T(g)PT(g -I) T(x)Q = l~ig m(g-l,g) 
 1 E m(x,g) T(xg)PT(g-1).  = I~Ig ~(g-l,g) Set h = xg. Then g-i = h-lx and hence 1 E m(x,x-lh) T(h)PT(h-lx) 
= T(x) Q =l~lh ~(h-lx,x-lh) i Z ~(x'x-lh) T(h)PT(h-i)T(x)" 131 h ~(h-lx,x-lh)w(h-l,x) But m(h-lx,x-lh) 
w(h-l,x) = ~(h-l,h)m(x,x-lh) so i i r(g) PT(g-1)r(x) = QT(x). T(x)Q =131 ~ m(g-l,g) Note also that 
for any m in M and x in G, i T(x)PT(x-i)m = T(x)PT(x)-im. Since N ~(x-l,x) is an mKG-subspace and PT(x-l)m 
is an element of N we see that i T(x)PT(x-l)m is in N. There- ~(x-±,x) fore Q is an element of HOMK(M,N). 
Clearly Qn = n for any element n of N so that Q is a projection of M onto N. Letting L = {m -Qm : meM} 
we see from T(x)Q = QT(x) for all x in G that L is also an ~KG-subspace of M. Because M = N @ L, M is 
completely reducible. Corollary: Suppose that char(K) does not divide the order of G and let ~ be any 
element of Z2(G,K*). Then mKG is semi-simple. Now let T be the ~-rep of G afforded by the ~KG-module 
M. From Theorem 2 we see that there is an element A in GL(M) such that Tl(g) 0 ] A-iT(g)A = ".. for 
all g in G. 0 Tn(g) From now on we will assume K is the field of complex numbers so that Theorem 2 will 
be valid. Definition 5: The T i appearing in the above expansion are called the irreducible components 
of T. The number of Tj in this expansion equiva- lent to T i is called the multiplicity of T i in T. 
Equivalent definitions can be made concerning the irreducible ~KG-modules M i which afford the ~-reps 
T i and also about the irreducible charac- ters afforded by the M i. The corollary to Theorem 2 allows 
us to use theorems concerning more general algebras. These theorems may be found in Curtis and Reiner, 
4 pages 179-189, and Huppert, 5 pages 469-474. Their implications concerning mKG-algebras are given in 
Theorems 3, 4, and 5. Theorem 3. Let S and T be irreducible ~-reps of G and let B be a linear transformation 
such that BT(g) = S(g)B for all g in G. Then B = 0 if S and T are inequivalent and B = ~I for some ~ 
in K* if  S and T are equivalent. Theorem 4: Suppose that M and N are mKG-modules affording the characters 
~ and ~, respectively. Then M ~ N if and only if ~ = ~. Theorem 5: Let {T=} s. ~ be a complete set of 
in-  ---E---=-----. 1=J_ qulvalent irreduci~le m-reps of G and suppose deg (Ti) = n i. Let n be the 
dimension of Z(mKG) over K. Then n = s and ~ hi2 =IGI. i=l Theorem 6: Suppose that M and N are irreducible 
~0KG-modules and let m be the dimension of M over K. Set 6 = 0 if M and N are not isomorphic and 6 = 
1 otherwise.  (A) Let T and R be the m-reps of G afforded by M and N, respectively, with T(g) = (~ij(g)) 
and R(g) = (Bij(g)). Then m E i ~pr(g)Bst(g-l) = ~pt6rs. IGlg m(g-l, g)  (B) Let ~ and p be the characters 
of G afforded by M and N, respectively. Then i ~ 1 ~(g)p(g_l) = ~. IGlg m(g -l,g)  Definition 6: Let 
m be an element of Z2(G,K*). A map f:G÷K is called an w-class function on G if ~(x-l,gx) m(g,x) f(x-lgx) 
= f(g) for all x, g in G.  m(x-l,x) The set of all m-class functions on G will be denoted by Cm(G). 
Note that if ~ is the character of G afford- ed by some mKG-module M, then ~ is in C~0(G). Theorem 7: 
Cm(G) is a Hilbert~ space with inner product given by (f,h) =,~, E f(g)~ and the set of all irreducible 
chara~r~ of G forms an orthonormal basis. If ~ is any character of G and ~ is irreducible, the multiplicity 
of ~ in is (~,~)G = i E 1 ~(g)~(g-l). IGlg m(g-±, g) If ~ is any character of G, ~ is irreducible if 
and only if (~'~)G = i.  Let H be a subgroup of G and m an element of Z2(G,K*). By an m-rep of H we 
mean a mH-re p of H where 0~H denotes the restriction of m to H. Definition 7: Let T be the 00-rep of 
H afforded tby ~ e mKH-module M and let M G = 00KG~v~M. M G becomes an mKG-module by defining ag(at~m) 
 (a~a~) (~ m and is called the 00KG-module induced fr~m~M. The m-rep of G afforded by M G is called G 
 the m-rep of G induced from T, T . n Suppose that {x i} . ~ is a complete set. of l=± K  left coset 
representatives of H in G and (mj}j=l is a basis for M. Then {ax. ~ mj}i=l, n : j=l,k i  is a basis 
of M G and therefore deg(T G) = nk. Let g be any element of G and suppose that gx i = xjh for some h 
in H. For any m in M we have a~(axi ~ m) = ~gaxi)~ m ~ m(g,xi)agxi ~ m = m~g,xi)ax~ h~ ~ m = m~g,xi] 
axja h ~ m = 00(xj ,h) -i axj (~ m(g,xi ) ahm. Since h = xj gxi, m(xj ,h) 00 (g,xi) = 0~(g,xi) m(xj-l,gxi)m 
(g,x~) m(xj,h) 00(xj,xj-±gx i) = m(xj-i,xj)  and therefore ag(axi ~ m) = axj @ °°(xj-l'gxi)m(g,xi ) 
m(xj-l,xj) axj-lgxim. If we let To(g) = T(g) if g is in H and To(g) = 0 otherwise, then TG(g) can be 
written as a matrix whose i,jth block is ~(xi-l,gx4)m(g,x4) -~(xj-i xj) To(xj-lgxi)" Theorem 8: Suppose 
that L and H are subgroups of G w~L < H. For any m-rep T of L, (TH) G and T G are equivalent. Theorem 
9: Let H < G and ~ the character of H afforded by the mKH-module M. Then the character of G afforded 
by M G, denoted ~G is given by = i E m(x-l'$x)~($ 'x) ~o(x-lgx) where ~G(g) IHI xeG m(x-~,x) #o(t) 
= ~(t) if t is in H and ~o(t) = 0 otherwise. Theorem i0: Let H~G, ~ an irreducible character of H, and 
~ an irreducible character of G. Then (~G,~)G = (~H,~) H. Definition 8: Let H A G, g an element of 
G, and M an mKH-module. We define a new action of mKH on the vector space M by setting ah* m = m($-l,hg)m(h,g) 
a=-lh~]m The mKH-module M g with . -± , ~ -°i " [ m~g ,gJ J this operation is called a G-conjugate of 
M. The m-reps of H afforded by conjugate mKH-modules are also called conjugate. The same terminology 
and notation will be applied to characters. Note that if T is the ~-rep of H afforded by M, then the 
m-rep Tg afforded by Mg is given by Tg(h) = m($-l,hg)m(h,g) T(g-lhg). ~(g-l,g) Theorem ii: Suppose that 
M is an irreducible mKG-module and H A G. The irreducible components of M H are all conjugate. Definition 
9: Let H A G, M an irreducible mKH- module, and ~ the character of H afforded by M. We set G~ = {ge G 
: ~g =~} and call G~ the little m-group of ~ in G. Observe that H A G~ and [G:G~] is the number of distinct 
G-conjugates of ~. Theorem 12: Let H A G, M an irreducible mKH-mod- ule, and T the m-rep of H afforded 
by M. Then T G is irreducible if and only if for all x not in H, T x is not equivalent to T. II. The 
algorithm In this section we present a method for find- ing most of the projective representations mention- 
ed in Theorem i. The theorems on which the algo- rithm is based are generalizations of theorems proved 
by Talburt 13 for the computation of irre- ducible (ordinary) representations of metabelian groups. We 
will be able to accomplish the same goal for m-reps of strongly metabelian groups. Using our results 
and those of Talburt we can then compute the representations at all points inside the Brillouin zone, 
at all points on the surface where the 2-cocycle m is a coboundary, and at all points on the surface 
where the associ- ated point group is strongly metabelian. Definition i0: The group G is called strongly 
metabelian if it has a cyclic normal subgroup H such that G/H is abelian. Theorem 13: Let p be a prime, 
H A G, [G:H] = p, and T a one-dimensional m-rep of H. If there is an x not in H such that T x = T, then 
T can be extended to p one-dimensional w-reps of G. Proof: If there is an x not in H such that T x = 
T then the little u-group of T is G, t~t is TY T for all y in G. Let G=H~JxH...U x ~- H be a left coset 
decomposition of H in G and suppose that y = xrh is any element of G. Let v  be a pth root of T(xP)P.~ 
I ~o(x,x i) and define T on i=± G by T(h) if r = 0 T(y) = vrr(h) m(xr,h)~m(x,x i) if r > O. To show 
that T is well-defined, assume that y = xrh = xSk where s = r + mp and h, k are in H. Then h = xs-rk 
= ~mPk. Using y = xSk we have vST(k) ~(y) = ~(xS,k)S~loo(x,xi) for s >0 and we can i=0 clearly assume 
that this is the case. If m = 0 there is nothing to prove so we also assume m > 0. vrvmPT(k) Then ~(y)

and T is well defined. ~0(xr,h) ~ ~o(x,x i) i=0 To show that T is an ~-rep of G we will use the following 
three equalities easily verified using the definition: (i) ~(xr,h)T(xrh) = T(xr)T(h) ,  (2) oo(xr,xS)T(xrx 
s) = T(xr)T(xS), and  (3) m(xrh,k)T(xrhk) = T(xrh)T(k).  Now consider (xrh)(xSk) = xrxSx-ShxSk. By 
(3) we have T(xrhxsk) oj(xrxSx-Shx s ,k) = T(xrxSx-ShxS)T(k) . Thus T(xrhxsk) m (xrhx s , k) m (xrx 
s , x-Shx s) = T(xrxS)T(x-ShxS)T(k) and hence T(xrhxsk) m (xrhx s , k) m (x r, x s) ~ (xrx s , x-Shx 
s ) = T(xr)T(xS)~(x-ShxS)T(k). This implies that T(xrhxsk) AB = T(xr)T(h)T(xS)T(k) = ~(xrh)T(xSk) 
where A = ~o(xrhxs,k)m(xr,xS)o0(xrxS,x-Shx s) and ~o(x -s , hxS)o~ (h ,x s ) B = oJ (xr,h) oJ (x s 
, k) o0 (x -s ,x s ) (xrhx s , k)~ (x r , hx s) m (h, x s ) = But we find AB = m(xr,h)~(x s,k) ~(xrhxs,k)m(xrh,x 
s) = m(xrh,xSk) so that o0 (x s , k) T is an m-rep of G. This completes the proof of Theorem 13. 
Theorem 14: Let G be a strongly metabelian group, H and H normal subgroups of G with H cyclic, G/H abelian, 
and [G:H] = p. Suppose that {Tj} is a family of one-dimensional m-reps of certain subgroups Hj ! H such 
that (i) any irreducible m-rep of H is equivalent to T. H for some j, and --J (2) H < H. for all j. 
 --]  Then given any irreducible L0-rep T of G either --G  T ~ Tj G for some j or T ~ T where T is 
an exten- sion of T. to a one-dimensional m-rep of a subgroup Hj < G which contains Hj as a normal subgroup 
of index p. Proof: Let T be any irreducible ~-rep of G and suppose that T H is irreducible. Then x 
T H ~ Tj H for some j. For any x not in H, T H (h) = ~(x-l, hx)~(h,x) TH(x-lhx) = ~(x-l,hx)~(h,x) ~(x-l,x) 
~(x-l,x) T(x-lhx) = T(x)-iTH(h)T(x) and therefore THX ~ T H. Thus (TH)G is not irreducible. Since 
(TH)G ~ (TjH) G ~ Tj G it follows that T. G is ' j  not irreducible. So there exists an x not in H° 
such that Tj x = Tj. Since Tj H is irreducible, 3 x is not in H. But xP is in H and Tj xp = Tj which 
implies xP is in Hj. We let Hj = Hj UxHj U ... U xP-iHj. Then Hj is a normal subgroup of G containing 
Hj as a normal subgroup of index p. Because Hj fl H = Hj we have p = [H--j:Hj] = [H--j:Hj f~ H] = [HH--j:H] 
and therefore G= HHj. n If {xi}i= 1 is a complete set of left coset representatives of Hj in H and g 
is not in H j, then g = ht where h is in H and t is not in Hj. Suppose that h = xik for some k in H.. 
Then g = xikt where kt is in H.. If xixj -I 3 , is in HJ -i J then xix j = h for some h in Hj and hence 
 xixj-i is in H f~ H° = H.. This is impossible 3 J so {xi}~= 1 is a complete set of left coset representatives 
of H in G. It follows that J if ~ is one of the p extensions of T. to Ho _G H ] J' then (T)H = Tj ~ 
T H. Now let x be in G, x not in Hj and assume _x that T = T. Then we would have ~xi = T for some i 
implying that Tj .xi = Tj. This would contradict T° H being Thus T irreducible. ~  J is irreducible. 
Suppose that two of the extensions, say T 1 and T2' induce to equiva- lent ~-reps of G. Then we would 
have T1 = T-- 2x for some x not in Hj. But T--2 m = T2Xi for some i and again Tj = T° Xi. 3 Therefore 
the p extensions of T. to H. in-  3 J duce to p inequivalent irreducible m-reps of G, all of which 
have the same degree as Tj H and all of which are irreducible components of (TH)G. But deg((TH)G = 
so that (TH)G- can have )-p deg(TH) at most p irreducible components of degree equal to deg(TH). Since 
T is also an irreducible component of (TH)G, it follows that T ~ ~T for one of the extensions. Now assume 
that T H is reducible and let R be an irreducible component of T H. First suppose that R G is not irreducible. 
Using the arguments above we see that R G has exactly p irreducible components and all of these components 
have the same degree as R. This is impossible since T is also an irreducible component of R G and we 
have assumed that T H is reducible. Thus R G is irreducible and R G ~ T. Therefore T ~ Tj G for some 
j and we are finished. Talburt's theorem for ordinary representa- tions is also important for our purposes 
and we will give it here. Theorem 15. Let H A G, [G:H] = p, and {Tj} be a family of linear representations 
on certaln subgroups H. < H such that (I) any irreducible representa- tion of H is equivalent 3 -- 
to TJ H for some j, and (2) Hj A G for all j. Then given any irreducible representation T of G, either 
T ~ T. G for some j or there is J a subgroup H. <G and an extension T of T. to a J -- 3 linear representation 
of H~ such that --G J g [H--j:Hj] = p and T ~ T Talburt applied this theorem to metabelian groups 
and constructed the irreducible repre- sentations inductively. Let G be metabelian and {e} = K0 ! K 
I ~ "'" ! Kn = G a solvable series for G with Kj A Kj+ I and the index Pj+i of Kj in Kj+ I prime. Suppose 
that K t is an abelian normal subgroup of G with G/K t abelian. We can then apply Theorem 15 to Kt+ 
1 using the linear representations of K t as the initial inducing family. These linear representations 
will be prolonged as far as possible up the solvable series and finally induced to G. The same procedure 
can be used in the projective case for strongly metabelian groups using Theorem 14 and the following 
two theorems. Theorem 16 is proved by Huppert, 5 page 643. Theorem 16: If G is cyclic, H2(G,K *) = 
{e}. That is, every 2-cocycle is a coboundary. Theorem 17: Let m, p be in Z2(G,K*). Then is a coboundary 
if and only if G has a one- dimensional ~-rep. If ~:G÷K* with ~(g,h) = ~($)~(h) p(g,h) for all g, h 
in G and R is ~(gh) any irreducible p-rep of G, then T defined on G by T(g) = ~(g)R(g) is an irreducible 
~-rep of G. All the irreducible ~-reps of G can be obtained in this manner. Now let G be strongly metabelian 
with {e} = K 0 ! K I ~ K2 ~ "'" !Kn = G a solvable series for G. This time some K t is a cyclic normal 
subgroup of G with G/K t abelian. From Theorem 16 we see that for j <_ t, 0JKj is a coboundary and 
hence by Theorem 17 the irreducible m-reps of K_. are all one-dimensional. These may be found fJrom 
the ~-reps of Ki_ I using Theorem 13. The procedure in the projective case for strongly metabelian groups 
is then the same as in the ordinary case for metabelian groups. By these remarks we then have the following 
algorithm, which is presented for the projective case. We assume that for i < j < n there is a family 
of one-dimensional ~-reps {Tm}nj~ defined on certain subgroups m=l {L m} contained in Kj_ I such that 
any irreducible m-rep of Kj_ 1 is linearly equivalent to an in- duced ~-rep Tmnj-l. We proceed to construct 
 similar families {S} and {N} for Kj. Computational Algorithm: (0) Set m = i.  (i) Choose an element 
g in K. not in Kj_ I which has not been used in (2)3and (3). If all such elements have been exhausted 
 set Slm = Tm, Nlm = L m and go to (5).  (2) If gPjis not in Lm, return to (i).  (3) If (m(g-l,hg)m(h,g)/~(g-l,g))Tm(g-lhg) 
#  Tm(h) for some h in Lm, return to (i).  (4) For each q, 1 _< q <_ Pj, let aq be a Pjth  root of 
(Tm(gPj)PJ~±m(g,gS))-- and define  sl'l Pj one-dimensional 0~-reps on the subgroup Nqm = <Lm,g > 
as follows. For y = grh in Nqm set Sqm(Y ) = Tm(h ) if r = 0 and r-i Sqm(Y) = aqrTm(h)/0~(gr,h)s~o~(g,g 
s) if r > 0. (5) Set m = m + 1 and return to (i) if m < n.. --3 As promised earlier in the section 
we will be able to use these methods to obtain the irreducible representations for the group of the wave 
vector at all points inside the Brillouin zone and at most points on its surface. Let's first consider 
those points inside. Here the cocycle for the associated point group is identically 1 and the problem 
reduces to finding the irreducible ordinary representations of the associated point group. For these 
points we can use Theorem 15 because of the thirty- two point groups there are (up to isomorphism) only 
two which are not metabelian. These are $4, the symmetric group of degree 4, and S 4 X C 2 where C 2 
denotes the cyclic group of order 2. The alternating group of degree 4 is, however, metabelian and hence 
all of its irreducible representations can be induced from one-dimensional representations on sub- groups 
normal in A 4. In fact the abelian normal subgroup F of A 4 which has abelian quotient is isomorphic 
to the Klein 4-group and contains all those permutations in S 4 which can be written as the product of 
two transposi- tions. Hence F is also normal in S 4. All of the irreducible representations of A 4 can 
there- fore be obtained by extending a one-dimensional representation of F to A 4 or inducing a one- 
dimensional representation of F to A 4. The one-dimensional extensions of these representa- tions of 
F in S 4 are not, however, extensions to subgroups which are normal in S 4 so we cannot use Theorem 15 
directly to obtain the irreducible representations of C 2 X S 4. But since there is an element in Z(C 
2 X $4) not in S 4 we easily see that we can apply the theorem even though these subgroups are not normal 
in C 2 X S 4. Therefore we are able to use our algorithm at all points inside the Brillouin zone and 
at all points on the surface of the Brillouin zone where the factor set of the associate point graup 
is a coboundary. Our success at other points on the surface of the Brillouin zone depends solely on 
the strongly metabelian nature of the associated point group. Of the thirty-two point groups there are 
(again up to isomorphism) four which are not strongly metabelian. These are A4, S 4, C 2 X A4, and C 
2 X $4, all of which only occur in the cubic symmetry. Fortran IV programs to implement the above algorithm 
in solid state routines have been written by the author. These programs receive as input operations in 
the associated point group and their corresponding translations. After computing a group table and the 
2-cocycle of Theorem i, a trial and error routine is used to find a solvable series for the group. The 
paper by J~rgesen 6 has been found to be especially useful for this purpose. The group table resulting 
from this routine is then used in a subroutine based on the above algorithm to compute the projective 
representations. Energy band programs written by Keown, Wiff, and Smart at Texas A&#38;M utilizing Slater's 
Augmented Plane Wave Method have been adapted to provide a suitahle interface between the Group Theory 
and the Solid State Physics. Questions concerning programming are invited. References i. C. Brott and
