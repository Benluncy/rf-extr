 Geometry is Everywhere, Part XLVII: Metrics, Nets, Dimensions, and Measures Kenneth L. Clarkson IBM 
Almaden Research Center ABSTRACT The idea of a metric space is among the most basic of geo­metric concepts, 
and so appears in a great variety of appli­cations and algorithms, sometimes in disguise. For a given 
metric,theidea of a net,inthegeneral senseof a collection of nicelydistributedpoints, appears naturally,butthere 
are many conceptions of what it means to be nicely distributed; oftenthisis afunctionof aparameter o> 
0, which mightbe for example the minimum distance between pairs of points inthenet. Foragivenversion 
of nets,theideaof dimension appears naturally, as the exponentin thegrowth rate of nets as a function 
of o, while measures on metric spaces give the constant factor in that growth rate. As the parameter 
o is varied, the scale of relevant features of the metric space changes; that is, variation in o is a 
simple form of multi­resolution analysis. I will survey a little bit of the wealth of variations and 
implications of these beautiful ideas, both those familiar to the SOCG community and those a little moreobscure, 
with such topicsas: thegreedy algorithmand other algorithms for building nets; curvature-based metrics; 
the energy dimension andits relationto randomprojection; the interplay between continuous concepts and 
discrete ap­plications; and di.erent versions of multi-resolution. Categories and Subject Descriptors
