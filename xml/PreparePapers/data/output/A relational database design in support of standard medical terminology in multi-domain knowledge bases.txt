to create knowledge bases for a medrcal dlagnostrc consul- tant system Known as MEDAS (Medrcal Emergency 
Decrsron Assistance System), thus expert system, usmg drsorder patterns consrstmg of features such as 
symptoms and laboratory results, 1s able to dragnose multrple drsorders Database technology has been 
used m MEDAS to develop knowledge engmeermg tools, called the TOOL BOX, wluch permrt domam experts to 
create knowledge w&#38;out the assrstance of a knowledge engmeer In the process of knowledge development 
wrth the TOOL BOX a standar&#38;zatton of terms was needed Thrs led us to design a Feature Drcttonary 
and a grammar to support a standardrzed format for features A common dlctronary of features wtll allow 
us to merge knowledge bases, translate between multr-domam bases, and com- pare competmg expert systems 
In addttron, srandard terminology wrll assist communicatton across domams lhe ER-Dragram of MEDAS and 
the Feature Drcuonary The Feature Dictionary has the followmg atmbu-tes Long forms of the feature name 
(White Blood Count) and short forms (WBC) as well as a three lme descnptron of the feature The type, 
bmary (Abdommal Pam), contmuous-valued (WBC). or derived (pulse pres- sure = systolic -dmstolm) IS also 
kept for each feature PermissIon to copy wthout fee all or part of thts mate4 1s granted prowded that 
the copies are not made or dlstrlbuted for direct commercml advantage, the ACM copyrlght notwe and the 
tdle of the publication and Its date appear, and notlce IS gwen that copymg IS by permlsslon of the Assoclatton 
for Com- puting Machmery To copy otherwse, or to repubhsh, reqmres a fee and/or specific permlsslon 0 
1988 ACM O-89791-268-3/88/0006/0203 $1 50 For value features the approprrate unrt (cc. kg, etc ) as well 
as range lmnts are stored so that these can be used as a form of quahty control on mput The permanence 
(Y/N) of each feature 1s kept so rt IS possrble to automatrcally include permanent features m future 
encounters In addttron, for each feature three separate cost parameters are kept Rusk measures the danger 
to the patrent from no risk such as takmg a blood pressure to highly mvasrve proreedmgs such as a bver 
hopsy Tune measures whether results can be expected m mm- utes, hours, or days Money measures the actual 
cost to the patrent FD-Equivalents stores the synonyms and antonyms of each feature These are used to 
tramrate between knowledge bases usmg different termmology Features were fist classified m terms of a 
Problem Onented Medtcal Record We have added an anatomical reclassrficatron m terms of body systems Experts 
Will be able to add new kmds of feature classrficatrons MEDAS, a multi-membershrp Bayesmn model, needs 
bmary representatrons for its mference These Binary Features are created by the expert physrcran m the 
gtven Qsorder patterns For example, WBC > 50,000 , or Age > 2 &#38; Female &#38; Hematocnt > 42 are bmary 
features that mrght appear rn a disorder pattern Laboratory results often lead to a multrphcrty of bmary 
features (such as WBC < 3,000 . or 3,000 < WBC c 10,000, etc ) Our desrgn allows the user to enter the 
value of such a feature and have the system set of ail the correspondmg bmary features This mtelhgent 
user m- tedace u controlled by a grammar that allows us to parse the bmary features and generate rules 
for them The knowledge base for a partrcular problem domaln such as OB/GYN 1s orgamzed as a collectron 
of drsorder patterns Each of these IS represented as a lrst of bmary features and associated probabrbtres. 
The domam knowledge base contams only the features relevant to that domam Expenence wrth the Feature 
Drctronary has convmced us that there are many advantages rn usmg a DBMS to store the knowledge base 
for an expert system The TOOL BOX, ongmally m ACCENT-R, was rewntten m dBase IIl for the PC The knowledge 
bases created on the PC were then ported to the msmframe As the number of domams supported by MEDAS grew. 
rt became evtdent that we needed a DBMS that could function m both envmmrnents so we are m the process 
of convertmg to ORACLE 203
