Planning Division Bell-Northern Research P.O. Box 3511, Station C Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, KIY 4H7 Abstract 
 Datapac is the public, packet-switched data commu- nication network recently introduced into service 
by the Trans-Canada Telephone System. It supports two distinct categories of services -'priority' and 
'nor- mal', where the priorities are user assigned. The de- lay performance for the Datapac services 
is specified in terms of the 'average delay' as well as '90th per- centile delay' for priority and normal 
class packets. This paper presents some queueing models for estimating packet delays in the communication 
subnetwork of Data- pac. The models can be applied for analyzing the sen- sitivity of packet delays to 
changes in such system parameters as: link capacities, link occupancies, rel- ative packet lengths for 
priority and normal class packets and relative mix of priority and normal class packets. I. Introduction 
 Datapac is a public, packet switched, data commu- nication network operated by the Trans-Canada Telephone 
System. A general overview of the Datapac network and services is given in I and 2. The Network Control 
Cen- tre, the Subscriber Interfaces and the Network Proto- cols are described in 3, 4 and 5 respectively. 
A dis- tinct feature of the Datapac service is that a user can request either a 'priority' or 'normal' 
class of ser- vice for any message. The priority class of service is primarily intended for inquiry-response 
or interactive applications for which near real-time delivery is a prime requirement. The normal class 
of service, on the other hand, caters for less time-critical applications, such as bulk data transfer 
or remote job entry. At each outgoing llnk in the network, priority class pack- ets are given preference 
(without preemption) over nor- mal class packets for onward transmission. Further, the maximum allowable 
size of priority packets is 128 octets (8 bits~octet) as compared to 256 octets for normal class packets. 
 In packet switched systems, packets experience queueing delays as they pass from node to node in the 
network and thus a significant performance measure for such networks is the speed with which packets 
can be delivered. A detailed analysis of queueing delays in general message switched (store and forward) 
networks was carried out by Kleinrock 6. These models were sub- sequently applied to the analysis and 
design of the ARPANET -the packet switched, computer communication network of the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency of U.S. Department of Defence 7. The proposed models as- sume Poisson arrivals and exponentially 
distributed packet-lengths, with First In First Out (FIFO) service. The delay analysis hinges on the 
so called 'Indepen- dence Assumption', which implies that each time a pack- et is received at a node 
in the network, a new packet length is chosen independently from an exponential dis- tribution. An approximate 
delay analysis for packet switched networks with fixed-length packets is provided by Rubin 8 . For the 
Datapac network, the delay performance is specified in terms of the 'average delay' as well as '90th 
percentile delay' (90% packets delayed less than T seconds) for priority and normal class packets. To 
estimate the 90th percentile delays, a knowledge of the actual delay distributions (or their suitable 
approxi- mations) for priority and normal class packets is need- ed. The delay suffered by a packet 
in the communica- tion subnetwork is defined as: the elapsed time be- tween the receipt of the last bit 
of a packet by the source node and the delivery of its last bit to the destination node. This delay is 
composed of the fol- lowing components: - switch time at the source, the destination and the tandem 
nodes, - propogation time over the inter-nodal links, - queueing (waiting) time in front of the inter-nodal 
links and - transmission time over the inter-nodal links. Switch delay has two components: waiting 
time for a processor to'become available and the actual proces- sing time. The switch delay is independent 
of the length and type of packets (priority or normal) and it is negligible at the tandem nodes (order 
of i to 3 msec). At the source and destination nodes the proces- sor may be modelled as a M/M/I queueing 
system with the mean processing time (service time) and the utilization factor estimated from the processor 
characteristics and the relevant packet arrival rates. According to the present estimates, the mean switch 
delay at the source and destination nodes is in the order of 60 to 70 msec. The propogation time depends 
on the path length and is generally small for radio or coaxial facilities (used in Datapac). For example, 
a propogation delay of 7 msec corresponds to II00 miles of coaxial cable or 1400 miles of microwave radio. 
 The queueing time (waiting time for an outgoing link to become free) and the transmission time (time 
required to read a packet out of the buffer onto the transmission link) will depend on the type of packet 
(priority or normal) and on the length of the packet. The major emphasis in this paper is directed towards 
estimating the packet delays in the communication sub- network due to the above two factors. As explained 
in a latter section (Section 4), the delay contributed by the processor and the finite propogation time 
can be easily incorporated in the final results. At the present time, the Datapac network consists of 
four nodes interconnected by 56 Kbits/second links in full duplex operation (Figure I). The packets be- 
tween any source node and destination node are routed via the most direct path. Since the network is 
almost fully connected, most of the logical connections (path taken by a packet from source to destination 
node)set up in the present network will utilize a single link. The overall network delay performance 
is therefore pri- marily determined by the delay characteristics of a single-link connection, modelled 
as a single stage queueing system. According to the present expansion plans, it is envisaged that by 
1980 the Datapac network will have fourteen nodes located at major Canadian cities (Figure 2). This larger 
network will not be fully connected so that some of the logical connections will consist of mmltiple 
links (connected through tandem nodes). In this case, the appropriate model for analyzing the net- ~Calgary

2 Planned (1980) Datapac Node Locations In Section 2, the basic queueing model for a node- link pair 
(single-link connection) in the Datapac net- work is formulated. Relevant closed-form expressions for 
the delay distribution of priority class packets are presented. The tall of the delay distribution for 
the normal class packets is approximated by the Gamma distribution and the approximation is validated 
by re- sults from a simulation model. The delay analysis for multilink connections is provided in Section 
3. The approximations used in the analysis are tested against suitable simulatlon experiments. Representative 
re- sults that bring out the effect of various system para- meters on the network delay performance are 
presented. Expressions for the probability density functions of queueing delay and the total system delay, 
for priority jobs in a head-of-line (non-preemptive) priority queue with two priority classes and appropriate 
service times, are derived in the Appendix. 2. Delay Analysis -Single-Link Connection In the Datapac 
network, messages generated by a user are packetlzed and the resulting packets are then delivered to 
the network node (source node). The in- coming packe~s at a network node are processed and buf- fered 
(queued) for onward transmission on the appropri- ate llnk. The priority class packets in the queue claim 
a head-of-line (non-preemptlve) priority over the normal class packets and, within their own class, the 
 packets are transmitted on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis. Thus, a single-link connection in the 
Datapac network may be modelled as a single server, head-of-line priority queueing system with two priority 
clas-ses. Before the above queueing system can be analyzed, we need to know the arrival and service-tlme 
distribu- tions for the priority and normal class packets. Arrival Distributions. The messages are generated 
outside the network by a variety of sources. For ex- ample, a sales-person in a department store entering 
point-of-sale information, a bank teller updating a customer's account or a computer program running 
on one machine needing information from another computer. As these messages are generated, they are packetized 
and the resulting packets are submitted to the network at the sender's node, where they are processed 
and placed in the appropriate queue for onward transmission. If the packets arrive at a network node 
from a large num- ber of independent sources over relatively low speed access links, the arrival distributions 
for the priori- ty and normal class packets may be modelled by indepen- dent Poisson processes with appropriate 
parameters 9. Service-time Distributions. The service-tlme dis- tributions for the above queuing model 
are essentially determined by the distribution of packet lengths and the capacity of the links over which 
they are to be transmitted. When a packet of length L bits is trans- mitted over a llnk with capacity 
C bits per second, the time required is L/C seconds. In Datapac, priority class packets can have a maximum 
of 128 octets (8 bits/ octet) of user data. The corresponding figure for the normal class packets is 
256 octets. The bits associa- ted with control, addressing and error checking are in addition to the 
user data and they constitute a fixed overhead associated with each packet handled by the network.* 
Assuming that the priority class service is used mostly for inquiry-response or interactive applica-tions, 
the probability density function (p.d.f.) for priority packet lengths (Lp) is expected to have a form 
shown in Figure 3(a). For analysis purposes, this is approximated by an exponential distribution, Figure 
3(b). (a) "~ I I 64 128 64 128 Lp (Octets) Lp (Octets) Figure 3 Distribution of Priority Packet Lengths 
The messages associated with the normal class of service are expected to be much longer than 256 octets 
(maximum user data allowed in a normal class packet). The p.d.f, of normal class packet lengths (L n) 
will perhaps have a form shown in Figure 4(a). In other words, most of the normal class packets are expected 
to * In practice, the packet length is a discrete varia-ble. To simplify the analysis, it will be considered 
as a continuous variable. have a fixed length (256 octets + overhead). As indi- cated in Figure 4(a), 
there may be a few normal class packets with shorter lengths. These represent normal class messages with 
less than 256 octets and the re- mainders (after dividing by 256) of long user messages. The closest 
approximation to the distribution shown in Figure 4(a) which is also mathematically tractable, is provided 
by Figure 4(b), i.e. the normal class packets may be considered to have a fixed length. A (a) }r (b)

Thus, for analyzing the delay encountered by pri- ority and normal class packets over a slngle-llnk con- 
nection in the Datapac network, the connection may be modelled as a single server, head-of-llne priority 
queue with two priority classes where: (a) the priority and normal class jobs arrive accord- ing to 
independent Polsson processes with parame- ters lp and ln,  (b) the service time for the priority jobs 
is exponen- tially distributed with mean tp, and  (c) the normal class jobs have a constant service 
time t n  Assuming that the probability of buffer overflows at the network nodes is negligible, the 
p.d.f, for queuelng time and system time (system time = queuelng time + service time) for priority class 
jobs in the above model are derived in the Appendix. The expres- sion for the p.d.f, of system time for 
the priority class jobs is given by:  (n ) Sp(t) = -l-pp--e + l-pp u(t)-u(t-tn In -(l-pp) (t-tn)/t 
p  (i) + u(t-tn) l-pp e where: Sp(t) = p.d.f, of system time for priority jobs Ip = average arrival 
rate for priority jobs average arrival rate for normal jobs %n = tp = average service time for priority 
jobs t n = constant service time for normal jobs pp = tplp = link utilization due to priority jobs 
tnl n = link utilization due to normal jobs Pn = p = Pp + Pn = total link utilization u(t) = unit step 
function at t=O and u(t-tn) = unit step at t=tn . The service times tp and t n are obtained by taking 
the ratio of corresponding packet lengths and the channel capacity. The general form of the above p.d.f, 
is shown in Figure 5(a) and it has a discontinuity at t = t n. The probability that the system delay 
for priority packets is greater than T seconds is obtained by integrating Sp(t) over the limits T to

Normal packets = 256 octets (fixed length) Priority/Total packets = 0.8 Similar closed-form expressions 
for the delay dis- tribution of normal class packets are not easy to de- rive. Since the normal class 
service is primarily in- tended for less tlme-critical applications, suitable approximations which can 
he justified by simulation ex- periments are adequate for this case. To find the 90th percentile delay 
for the normal class packets, the p.d.f, of system delay for normal class packets was ap- proximated 
by the Garm~a distribution using the mean and  variance of Dn, where D n is the system delay for normal 
class packets. Th~ mean E(D n) and the variance V(D n) of D n are given by 0: Pt ~ E(Dn) = 2~(l-pp)(l-O) 
+ tn (4) (J V(Dn) = ~(l_pp)2(l_p) ~ + ~ + (l-pp)/ (5) where t, and t are the first, second and third 
mom- ents, respectively, of the overall (priority + normal) service-time distribution. For exponential 
service time for the priority packets and constant service time for the normal packets, these three moments 
are given by: t =rtp + (l-r)tn, 2 2 t = 2rtp + (l-r)tn, and 3 3 t = 6rtp + (l-r)tn, where r = lp/(%p 
+ Xn ) = Xp/Z = ratio of priority to total packets. The mean E(Dp) and the variance V(Dp) of the sys- 
tem delay for the priority class packets is similarly given by: Pt 2 m(Dp) -2t(l-Pp) + tp (6)  P t 
~ ( t ~ P t ~ __~ 2 .(Dp) -4t(l_0p) ÷ (1-0p)) ÷tp (7) Thus, for the priority class packets, the average 
delay for a single-link connection is given by (6) and the 90th percentile delay (i.e. the value of T 
for which P(Dp~ T) = 0.I) can be obtained from (2) or (3). For normal class packets, the average delay 
is given by (4) and the 90th percentile delay was estimated from the Gam~na distribution with parameters 
E(D n) and R = E 2 (Dn)/V(Dn). To test the validity of the Gamma ap- proximation used above, a single-link 
connection was simulated using GPSS. The results obtained from the analysis and the simulation experiment, 
for a represen- tative set of system parameters, are compared in Table  I. Some typical results provided 
by the above analyti- cal models for delay performance of a single-link con- nection in the Datapac network 
are shown in Figure 6.   3. Delay Analysis - Multilink Connection As mentioned earlier, the Datapac 
network will grow into a fourteen-node network by 1980. It is en- visaged that in the full-grown network, 
a significant portion of logical paths set up between a source and a destination node will utilize multiple 
links (tandem connections). The appropriate model for analyzing the source to destination node delay 
for such multilink zonnections is a series of queues in tandem, where each queue (in the series) represents 
a node-link pair in the logical connection. An exact analysis for such a network of queues is difficult 
because: (a) the arrival and service-tlme processes at the in- termediate queues are no longer independent

and the service-time distributions imply that the departure process from a queue in the series network 
(which forms a part of the arrival process for the next queue in series) will not be Poissonian. * Though 
the capacity of inter-nodal links is 56 Kbits/ second, the effective bandwidth available for packet transmission 
is 48 Kbits/second because part of the bandwidth is used up for transmission of synchroniza- tion information. 
 Though a pure simulation approach offers a viable al- ternative, it is not well suited for a detailed 
sensi- tivity analysis. Besides placing an unduly heavy de- mand on computer resources, a pure simulation 
approach does not provide the same degree of flexibility as the analytical model. Under the circumstances, 
an approxi- mate analytical solution supported by suitable simula- tion runs seems suitable. If the 
independence assumption for the network of queues and the Polssonlan assumption for departure pro- cesses 
are accepted on an aprlorl basis, the p.d.f, of system delay over N links (N-I tandem nodes) for the 
priority class packets can he obtained by taking an N- fold convolution of the p.d.f, for a single llnk 
given by (i)*. However, for a logical connection with three or more llnks~ the resultant expressions 
tend to be un- duly long and complicated. After a comparative study using suitable simulation experiments, 
the following approximate, but simple procedure for estimating the average and 90th percentile delays 
(both for priority and normal class packets) over a N-link connection was adoptedll: -Calculate the 
average delays Ei(Dp) , Ei(D n) for pri- ority and normal class packets, respectively, and the corresponding 
variances Vi(D p) and Vi(D n) over the individual links: i = 1,2, ...,N, using (4), (5), (6) and (7). 
 -Calculate the total (over N links) average delays E(Dp(N)) and E(Dn(N)) for priority and normal class 
packets, respectively, and the total variances V(Dp(N)) and V(Dn(N)) by summing up the corresponding 
values for the N individual links. -To estimate Dp(90%) and Dn(90%), the 90th percentile delays for 
priority and normal class packets, respec- tively, fit Gamma distributions using the following sets of 
parameters: PRIORITY: E(Dp(N)) and Rp = E2(Dp(N))/V(Dp(N)) NORMAL: E(Dn(N)) and R n = E2(Dn(N))/V(Dn(N)) 
 For the model under consideration, it was observed that the parameters Rp and R n were always greater 
than unity (mean greater than standard deviation). In this case the individual terms of the incomplete 
Gan~na func- tion, required in the last step, can he easily calcula- ted by using the foil owlng relationship 
with Erlang B distrlbutionl2: A / ® -Ax A e -AT (AT) R-I FR T (Ax) R-I e dx = FR B(R-I, AT) (8) where 
rR represents the Gamma function and B(R-I, AT) is the Erlang B loss probability when AT erlangs are 
offered to R-I servers. For fractional values of R, B(R-I, AT) can be approximated from a linear interpola- 
tion of Erlang B loss for appropriate integral values for the number of servers (i.e. the closest integers

three links (two tandem nodes) with system parameters that are representative of the Datapac network

two sections pertain to the packet delays in the communica- tion subnetwork due to queuelng of packets 
at the out- going links and the transmission time over these links. As mentioned in Section I, the packets 
will encounter additional delays due to two other factors, v.i.z. switch time at the source and destination 
nodes and the propogatlon time over the links. Knowing the mean and * For R greater than unity a quick

subnetwork for Datapac, similar models are applicable for estimat- ing the delays (due to queueing) over 
the network ac- cess links (source DTE to source node and destination node to destination DTE). In other 
words, the models may also be used for estimating the packet delays as seen by an end user. The analytical 
procedures discussed in this paper provide the necessary tools to carry out a sensitivity analysis of 
network delay performance. Such a sensiti- vity analysis was carried out for the Datapac network and 
the results presented in this paper are representa- tive samples. 5. References I. Clipsham, W.W. and
