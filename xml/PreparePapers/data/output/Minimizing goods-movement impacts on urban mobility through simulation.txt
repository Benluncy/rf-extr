 MINIMIZING GOODS-MOVEMENT IMPACTS ON URBAN MOBILITY THROUGH SIMULATION Philip A. Habib and Kenneth 14. 
Crowlev Polytechnic Institute of New York ABSTRACT This paper describes the use of simulation techniques 
in the development of standards for off-street loading facilities for goods distribu- tion in the city 
center. This work uses a simple GPSS model to quantify queues of trucks and also uses a complex traffic 
simulator to quantify the "congestion" resulting from the formation of que-ues at inadequately planned 
and operated off- street loading facilities. This paper is drawn from research sponsored by The Office 
of Univer- sity Research, U.S. Department of Transportation. INTRODUCTION There are relevant considerations 
to justify the provision of off-street loadina facilities for pickup and delivery (PUD) vehicles in the 
city center. These include: the reduction in on-street traffic and pedestrian conflicts, the reduction 
in visual/aesthetic intrusion, and an improvement in security of the goods. There are also relevant arguements 
against the provision of off-street loading facilities in the city center. These in- clude: increased 
cost to the developer (and there- fore, to the tenants), the potential access (back-ing-in) problem, 
and the truck queues that develop because the facilities are not designed or oper-ated efficiently. This 
paper presents a new and practical ap-proach to determining the number of off-street loading berths that 
should be designed into large newly-constructed goods generators in the city center. This approach produces 
a result that ans-wers the question: how many loadina berths are nec-essary for a specific generator 
such that the total costs to society (the relevant portions) are mini-mized. ECONOMIC CONCEPT If a new 
structure is to be built in the city center, then a total cost function could be formu- lated, with the 
number of off-street berths remain-ing a variable. The costs would be the dollar val-ue of the impacts 
on Society, the relevant portions of which are presented in Table 1 (FiQure 1 shows the graphical representation). 
The cost function would be in the form: C(b) = c l(b) + c2(b ) + c3(b ) + .... where b is the number 
of off-street loadina berths Cl(b), c2(b), c3(b) are functions relat- inQ number of berths to the cost 
of imnact on the interest arouos. TABLE l-- "SOCIETY" FOR OFF-STREET LOADING Severity of ~npact when

LNADING Winter Simulation Conference 267  In order to find the value of "b" that mini-mizes the above 
function, one would calculate dC/db, and equate it to zero, solving for "b". However, studies (1,2) have 
shown that the indi- vidual cost functions cannot be expressed alge- braically because they are derived 
from computer simulations. Therefore, "b" is found by solving the above equation for various probable 
berth con-ditions and the least cost value would become ap- parent. Simulatin9 Carrier Costs The cost 
incurred by carriers (and therefore by consumers) at off-street loading facilities is primarily determined 
by delays while waiting in truck queues. Research (1,2) has shown that the arrival times to loading facilities 
and the ser-vice rate patterns (dwell times) are characteris-tics of the land use of the specific site. 
If the dwell time distribution was exponential (or close to it), or if only the one-berth condition is 
be-ing evaluated, queuing statistics could be gener- ated analytically. However, this is not the case 
and therefore these queuing statistics must be generated through simulation. A simple GPSS model was 
designed for this purpose, the block diagram for which is shown in Figure 2. The use of this type of 
model provides additional information and data useful in deter- mining costs to other societal elements 
and will be presented further in this paper. Cenera~e PUD vehicles aca mean arrival race ~q,, and v~ch

"lost" by usinQ the approoriate value of time. A conservative estimate for this value is $9.00 per hour 
of delay. Simulating Developer's Cost The "cost" to the developer for providinQ off- street berths includes 
the construction cost of the facility l~_]_u_sthe lost revenue (opportunity lost) had the developer used 
this space for some revenue generating purpose. The construction cost of the docks minus the construction 
cost of the revenue- generatinQ facility, when capitalized over the life of the structure is usually 
not a very sizeable amount and can be neglected in most cases. The method of calculatina develooer's 
cost is to consider that tenants will be willinQ to Day the cost of DrovidinQ off-street loadinQ facilities 
to the extent that these facilities are needed . Thus, the cost to the developer would only be that portion 
of the business day when the facilities are not utilized. The utilization method for devel- oper's cost 
would conclude that if a developer oro- vided an off-street loadinQ facility that was oc- cupied I00 
percent of the time, the resultant cost would be zero. If the facility was occupied 60 per- cent of the 
time, then the cost to the developer would be 40 percent of the ODDOrtunity cost. The GPSS model produces 
facility utilization statistics that makes calculation of this cost verv straight forward. The opportunity 
cost would be the expected rental charge per square foot, times the area devoted to any specific dock 
confiauration, as well as any normal maintenance and operations cost. In most cities, because docks are 
on the ground floor, the rental charQe is between ~10-~2n per square foot. FiQure 3 shows typical GPSS

Traffic Costs The queuing of vehicles at loading facilities can adversely affect traffic flow, dependino 
on the traffic volume and the street width. Ouantifvina the imoact on traffic is most tedious, and requires 
the use of the Network Simulation Model UTCS-I(3). The cost of the lane blockages is borne by the af- 
fected traffic and the community through increased delay, air pollution and road user costs. It has not 
been substantiated that accident occurrence in- creases under these low speed conditions, but one would 
expect such an increase. The UTCS-I simulates the effect of the lane blockage on traffic characteristics 
for a Given set 268 December 6 -8 1976 of network conditions, such as traffic volume, block length, 
cycle length, etc. All impacts are incremental impacts caused by the lane blockage as, in normal traffic, 
delays are normal-ly encountered. The delays of concern here are the delays over and above those normally 
occurrinQ. The increased operating costs due to the in- cremental congestion are primarily attributable 
to the increased number of stops and starts caused by the blockage. These increased number of stops result 
from the maneuvering, as well as from missed progression in the signal system. The UTCS-I outputs data 
on the number of stops, as well as average travel speed before, during and after the blockage. Figure 
4 is a typical output from UTCS-I and shows the aggregate statistics for a three minute simulation period.

UTCS-I OUTPUT FIGURE 4 The delay and increased operatinq costs can be translated into their dollar equivalents 
by using appropriate factors. This work uses $2.20 per person hour for passenger delays. The figure for 
commercial-vehicle value of time is given pre- viously. For operating costs, values of $6.00 per I000 
stops for autos and $12.00 per I000 stops for trucks are used. These figures are updates from a 1972 
study (4). Curbside Parkin 9 Costs Provision of "standing" space for queued ve- hicles outside loading 
docks in order to minimize traffic impact, results in a displacement cost for the curbside auto spaces. 
As a result, the pro-vision must be made for an equivalent amount of off-street parking spaces, as these 
vehicles can-not be displaced to other curb space because the supply of these spaces is not expandable. 
The cost of providing parking spaces for displaced porkers is construction cost, maintenance and oper- 
ation cost, and land acquisition cost. These off- street parking spaces may be in garages or in park-ing 
lots. The annual cost of each displaced auto parking space in the city center is $8,000 to $I0,000 per 
space. The number of spaces would be determined by the truck queuing conditions. Other Costs Other costs 
incurred in this process fall in the category of "unquantifiable". Such aspects as air and noise pollution 
caused by different dock configurations cannot realistically be translated into dollar equivalents. The 
same is true for aes- thetic considerations. CASE STUDY The case study site is an 800,0~0 square foot 
office building located on a 600 foot block. The abuttino street has three lanes in each direction and 
has metered Darkina at curbside. The buildino generates about 64 trucks on the tyoical day and the arrival 
pattern is that typical of office build-ins (2). Figure 5 depicts the case study site. III I" m u m m

 Winter SLmldation Conference 269 SUMMARY As a gauge of comparison, if the case study office building 
was constructed in the Atlanta city center, ten berths would be required by that city's code. If the 
building were in Pittsburgh six berths would be adequate while, in Cincinnati, four berths would satisfy 
that city's requirements. Not only does this new approach produce a reason- able result with respect 
to existing requirements but widespread use will make these highly diver- gent city standards more uniform. 
The next step in this process is the develop- ment of a users manual for local planning agencies as the 
computing facilities to run all models for each newly constructed building is impractical. The Polytechnic 
is now preparing such a manual. REFERENCES 1. Philip A. Habib, Accommodating Goods-Movement Vehicles
