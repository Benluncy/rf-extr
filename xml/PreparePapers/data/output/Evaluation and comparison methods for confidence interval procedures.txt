and compare confidence interval procedures (CIP). A CIP is a function parameterized by a scalar constant 
~ E [0,I], mapping a realization of continuous or discrete stochastic process {X(t) ; t E T} to the real-valued 
random interval (L a, Uc~). The primary criterion to evaluate the CIP~s is the comparison between the 
nominal coverage, i -~, and the actual coverage of a known para- meter e 0. One minus this probability 
is analo- gous to type I error in hypothesis testing. This coverage can be generalized to a coverage 
function, B(a,8) = Pr {L < e < u } , 0 < ~ < i, -~ < 8 < ~. When 0 # e0, this probability is analogous 
to type II error; the lower the probability the better the procedure. In addition to the coverage, 
the mean and the variance of the interval width are measures of the accuracy and variability of the point 
esti- mator of e 0, respectively. Both coverage probabilities and properties of interval width are special 
cases of expected loss. The loss function g[6 O, (La, Uc)] represents the loss incurred by the interval 
(~,u) including the points other than e O. The expected loss is defined by, E{~[O0,(L ~, Ua)]} = = 
~ oog[O0,(~,u)] f (g,u) d~ du /:A FOR CONFIDENCE INTERVAL PROCEDURES Bruce Schmeiser School of Industrial 
Engineering Purdue University West Lafayette, IN 47907  SUMMARY The coverage function, B(~,e), is 
obtained from the expected loss of the 0 -l loss function. The mean and variance of the intervals are 
obtained analogously by considering the loss functions (u %) and [(u -~) -E(U -L ] 2, respectively. 
 Coverage contours are the pictorial represen- tation of the coverage function, B(~,e). The expected 
interval width and the coverage appear on one figure. Bounds on the variance of interval widths can be 
obtained from the coverage function. The joint density function, f (%,u), is funda-  mental to the 
study of the properties of confidence intervals. The performance of a CIP on a single realization is 
soley a function of the interval (~,u) arising from its application. Since the realization is random, 
fundamental evaluation of a CIP, which requires the knowledge of f (Â£,u), must be based on performance 
over many replications. A natural way of estimating f (~,u) is scatter diagrams. Various scatter diagrams, 
which exhibit the variability of confidence intervals, are developed to supplement the coverage contours.
