 Canonical Representatives for Residue Classes of a Polynomial Ideal Markus Lauer Universit~t Kaiserslautern 
 March 1976 Abstract At the EUROSAM Conference 1974 it was conjectured that there exist probably no 
canonical forms for polynomial expressions under polynomial side relations. In 1965, however,Buchberger 
had already implemented a reduction algorithm solving the problem over fields. Positive results were 
also attained independently since 1974 by R. Shtokhamer and the author. In this note a general theorem 
on canonical representati- ves is obtained and by application to  Buchberger's and Shtokhamer's algorithms 
it is proven that the stated problem is solved . I. Introduction  In Computer Algebra systems operations 
are performed on algebraic objects having an extended structure. Usually many equi- valent structures 
represent the same ob- ject. However,the algorithms require the collection of equivalent terms, the dropp- 
ing of terms equivalent to O and similar simplifications. It is therefore advan- tageous for algebraic 
algorithms to work on unique representatives of equivalent structures, called canonical forms of the 
algebraic objects. Canonical forms for lar- ge classes of expressions were studied by Caviness [I], Brown 
[2], Moses [3] and Kleiman [15]. Frequently in practice algebraic opera- tions have to be performed 
in the context of side relations, user defined simplifi- cation rules, pattern matching or similar machinery-invented 
for the convenience of the user. Naturally the questions arise [4], is there an algebraic meaning of 
such manipulations, can canonical forms still be defined in such an environment? The practical goal is 
of course to utilize the side relations to the utmost point for the reduction of expressions. For the 
uninitia- ted reader it may be surprising that the semantics of an expression evaluator using a rule 
stack [SCRATCHPAD,5] is intimately related to chain conditions and ideal theo- ry 2. Statement of the 
Problem Before we give an example we start with a precise statement of the mathematical problem : Let 
S be a field (case I) or a principal ideal domain (case 2) , let R = S[x4 ,... ,x ] | r (r a I) and 
U = (f ..... ,f ) the ideal gene- i s rated by f.,...,f , members of R . Find a i .s . . computable 
function F: R + R with propertles (I) F(g) -g 6 U , for all g 6 R  (2) F(g) = F(h) <=> g -h 6 U, for 
all g,h 6 R  Also F(g) should be "simpler" than g in a sense which has to be made precise . As example 
consider the two side rela- tions as they may be realized by LET state- ments 3x2y = 3x 2 -y2 + 2 ; 
4xy = -I ; First we note that x and y may stand for more general expressions like kernels , so polynomial 
expressions are not as restric- tive in practice as it may appear at a first glance . Intuitively the 
meaning of the side relations is the replacement of the two polynomials fl = 3x2y -3x2 + y2 _ 2 , f2 
= 4xy + I by O "as often as possible" in all follo- wing expressions . (By this interpretation there 
is no restriction to monomials on the left hand side of the side relations.) The hard problem for an 
algebraic system is to draw all conclusions from the side relations because otherwise large expressions 
equiva- lent toO can occur, causing space to be exhausted. In the example, there are poly- nomials A 
and B 6 R such that the expression (in y only!) g =16y 4 -32y 2 + 3y -3 = Af I + Bf 2 = O vanishes 
-a hard test for a symbolic sy- stem . Now, the set of all polynomials of the form Af I + Bf~ for arbitrary 
A,B 6 R is just the'ideal-U generated by fl and f2 and the problem studied for a given g is how can g 
be reduced with respect to U. For both cases of the coefficient domain S the problem is solved. If S 
is a field (case I) the solution is a by-product of a result of Buchberger [6] giving an algo-  Proceedings 
of the 1976 ACM Symposium 339 on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation rithmic criterion for the solvability 
of a system of algebraic equations. If S is a principal ideal domain (case 2) the solu- tion is obtained 
by generalizing the no-  tion of a Szekeres basis [7,9] to Noethe- rian rings . In both cases the main 
work consists in constructing for the ideal a suitable ba- sis which in a natural way allows the defi- 
 nition of the desired function F. In case I this is accomplished by Buchberger's al- gorithm, in case 
2 by an algorithm due to Shtokhamer [7] . After establishing a general theorem on canonical representatives 
in the next sec- tion, it is applied in the remaining two sections to both algorithms, allowing a 
unified treatment of these two independent approaches 3. Canonical Representatives The most extensive 
generalization of the problem is to treat it in terms of equivalence relations as will be done in this 
section . 3.1 Definition : Let M be a set, ~ an equivalence relation on M. An ample func- tion [10,11] 
(af) for (M,~) is a mapping" f : M + M such that : (AI) f(a) ~ a for all a E M (A2) a ~ b => f(a) = 
f(b) for all a,b 6 M . Two evident properties of an af are sta- ted in the following lemma . 3.2 Lemma 
: Let f be an af for (M,~).Then: (I.) f2 = f (2) f(a) = f(b) => a ~ b for all a,b E M. Proof: (I) 
(At) : f(a) ~ a => (A2) f2(a) = f(a) (2) let f(a) = f(b) . Then: a ~ f(a) = f(b) ~ b . | Now it is 
clear what a canonical represen- tative is : 3.3 Definition : Let f be an af for (M,-). For a 6 M let 
~ denote the equivalence class containing a . The unique element a ~ 6 ~ for which f(a*) = a* holds is 
called a canonical representative for Of course there are usually several pos- sibilities to define 
canonical representa- tives for the same equivalence relation . For example set M = Z (the integers) 
and a ~ b iff a ~ b mod n for some fixed posi- tive n 6 Z. For a 6 Z there exist unique rl,r 2 6 Z such 
that : a = qln + rl , O ~ rl < n n and a = q2 n + r 2 , -~ < r 2 Then fl and f? defined by f~(a) 
= ri,i=1,2 , are botM af's.-One way to select a special af is to define a suitable ordering on M . 3.4 
Definition : Let f be an af for (M,-). Let ~ be a partial ordering for M. Then f is called a simplifying 
ample function (saf) for (M,~,~) if: (A3) f(a) ~ a for all a 6 M . As an immediate consequence of (A2) 
we have ;  3.5 Lemma : Let f be a saf for (M,-,~) Then f(a) ~ b for all b 6 ~ . That condition (A3) 
is indeed sufficient for choosing a unique af is the content of the next theorem . 3.6 Theorem : There 
exists only one saf for (M,~,~) Proof: Let fl and f2 be two saf's for (M,~,~). Clearly f1(a) ~ f2(a) 
for all a 6 M. Therefore by lemmas (3.2) and (3.5): fl (a) = f~(a) ~ f2(a) and analoguesly f2(a) ~ 
fl (a) It is clear that a saf is unique only with respect to the chosen ordering. In the example above 
with M = Z rood n fl is a saf for the following ordering ~1 : l a = 0 &#38; b ~ 0 a > 0 &#38; b < 0 
a <I b <=> sign(a) = sign(b) &#38; lal < Ibl and a ~i b <=> a = b or a <1 b. Similarly, f2 is a saf 
for the ordering &#38;2 : [ial = Ibl &#38; a > b a <2 b <=> tlal # Ibl &#38; lal < Ib) and a &#38;2 
b <=> a = b or a <2 b. It is easy to see that there exists no saf for Z with the normal ordering ~ and 
the congruence relation. As a converse of lemma(3.5) we have the following existence lemma for saf's 
:  3.7 Lemma : If each equivalence class ~ of (M,~,~) contains a minimal element a*, then the mapping 
 f: b + a* for all b 6 is a saf Proof : obvious For practical purposes a saf should also be a computable 
(recursive) function, an as- pect which has been neglected until now .In [8], B. Caviness et al. give 
an existence lemma for computable af's. A computable af is called canonical form. If M is an additive 
group then condition (A2) is weakened to: (A2') a ~ b ~ O => f(a) = f(b) for all a,b 6 M. A computable 
mapping f: M ÷ M with (At) and (A2') is called a normal form. The existence lemma is : Lemma : (Caviness 
et al.) If M is recursively enumerable and if there  is a normal form for (M,-) , then there is a canonical 
form for (M,~). The canonical form they construct is the same as in lemma(3.7). They use the fact that 
a recursively enumerable set is well-ordered by it's G~del numbering, and then use th~ computability 
of the normal form and the G6del numbers to show that the function f of lemma(3.7) is computable. For 
the application to the problem of section 2 the set M is the polynomial ring R in several indeterminates 
and the equi- valence relation is the congruence modulo an ideal U (g ~ h <=> g -h 6 U)° If the coefficient 
domain is recursively enumera- ble, then R is recursively enumerable; how- ever the problem of fZnding 
a normal form for R seems to be not easier than finding a canonical form. We shall use the alge- braic 
properties of R and U for finding a computable saf for (M, ~) with a suitable order &#38;. 4. The Case 
of a Field (Buchber~er's Al~orithm) Let S be a field, R = S[xl,...,x ] , and U = (fj,...,f) be an ideal 
in R. The equivalence relation ~ is defined as f ~ g <=> f -g 6 U for all f,g 6 R. We have f -g 6 U 
<=> f + U = g + U 6 R/U. If we have a linearly independent basis B for the vector space R/U (over S) 
then each residue class g + U has a unique re- presentation g + U = glbl + U +...+ gkbk + U, where 
gi 6 S and b i + U 6 B, i = 1,...,k. Hence the polynomial glbl +...+gkbk 6 R can be considered as a 
canonical represen- tative for ~, and ~ algorithm which finds for each g 6 R the representation of g 
+ U in the basis B can be considered as a com- putable ample function. Therefore the goal is to find 
~ linearly independent basis B for R/U and such an algorithm. The follo- wing solution is taken from 
Buchberger[6 ] where the omitted proofs can be found. S being a field we may assume that the fl,...,fs 
of the ideal basis are monic. I. I. fj = X13'I ... Xr3'r + (I) (J) i I i r + Z all ...i r x I ... 
xr = = it(fj) + red(fj) where it(f~) denotes the leading term and red(f.) th~ reductum of f~. The terms 
are ordered with respect to 3 the total de- grees and lexicographically otherwise. Clearly, the set of 
all residue classes of all mo~omials x%1 ... x~ r is a basis for R/U which generally is linearly dependent 
unless U = (0). To construct a linearly independent subset Buchberger observes for an arbitrary term 
x~1 ... x~r ii ir it(fj) x I ... x r i I i (2) ~ -... red(fj) x I x r since f. 6 U. The left hand 
side is a mul- tiple 3 of it(f~). A monomial wl~ich is not a multiple of any it(f~) is called a kernel 
and one defines 4.3 Definition : An M-reduction of a polyno- mial g 6 R is the iterative replacement 
of all terms of g which are multiples of a It(f.) by the corresponding right hand sides of 3(2) as often 
as possible. This definition differs slightly from the original one given in [6]; but all re- sults 
stated below are valid for this defi- nition, too (see [16]). By an M-reduction multiple terms of the 
it(f&#38;)'s are eliminated by subtracting sui- tabl4 multiples of the basis polynomials f . The process 
generalizes division -g is 3 "divided" by the whole basis -and the re- sult is the "remainder" of this 
"division". The result is in general not unique but is a polynomial -g with kernel terms only. Therefore 
the residue classes of all kernels with respect to f., ..,f are a basis for I " R/U and the criterion 
ho~ds : 4.4 Lemma : If the basis {fl,...,f } of an ideal U in R has the proper£y thatSall pos- sible 
M-reductions of a polynomial in R give the same result, then the residue classes of the kernels with 
respect to f I'" ... are a linearly independent basis   for 'fs R/U . In [16], Buchberger attributes 
the idea for this lemma to W. Gr~bner. A basis which satisfies the condition of this lemma is therefore 
called a Gr6bner-basis (abbrevia- ted G-basis) . Buchberger gives the following algorithm based on this 
lemma. Let f. and f~ be two different elements of 3 K the ideal basis, It(f~) and it(f, ) their , 
 leadlng terms, respectively. Let pp4 ~ be the least common multiple of the ~"" leading terms, i.e. 
 L Lj,k, r PPj,k = xlJ'k'1 "Xr where Lj,k, t = max(Ij, t , Ik, t) (see eq.(1)). From equation (2) follows 
: PPj,k ~ (3) (J) i1+dj, I ir+dj, r ~ -~ all Xl ..-x r ,.-.,i r and PPj,k ~ (4)  (k) il+dk, 1 ir+dk, 
r ~ -~ ail x I ... ,...,i r r  where dj, t = Lj,k, t -Ij, t and dk,t = Lj,k,t -Ik,t ' t = 1,...,m. 
 The polynomial obtained by subtrac- tion of the right sjk hand sides of (3) and (4) is called the S-polynomial 
for ppj,k.NOte that Sjk =_fj~ -fk b e R with = PPj,k / it(fj) , b = PPj,k / it(fk) The algorithm performs 
then an M-reduction of s. k with respect to the present ideal basil. If the result is non-zero, it is 
made monic and joined to the ideal basis. These operations are done for all pairs of different elements 
of the ideal basis, and also for those polynomials which are added to the basis. Two special cases are 
regarded: $I. PPj,k = it(fj) (or PPj,k = it(fk))" Then, after the operations described are performed, 
the polynomial f (or fk respectively) is removed from J the basis. $2. PPj,k = It(fj)~it(fk)" Then the 
opera- tions are not performed, and the next PPj,k is processed. B ÷ GBASIS(A)  [Gr6bner basis. A 
={fl .... ,fs }, a basis for an ideal U in S[Xl, .... Xr]. B is a G- basis for the same ideal U.] (I) 
[Initial basis] B ÷ A.  (2) [Least common multiples] for all dif- ferent pairs fj ' fk E A include 
 cj, k = icm(it(fj),It(fk)) in a list L unless Cjk = it(fj)~It(fk). (3) [Empty L] for each element 
Cjk of L perform step 4-7 and stop.  (4) [Subtraction] Let Cjk = icm(it(fj) , it(fk)), set Sjk to the 
  ccrr~-pcndi~L~ S-polynomial. (~) [Reduction] M-reduce Sjk to s~ver B. If s k = O, perform with the

L by all Csi = = icm(it(fi),it(sjk)) for all fi in B unless Csi = it(fi)~it(sjk). (7) [Prune L] If 
Cjk = it(fj) then remove fj from B and remove all Cje and Cqj from L; similarly, if Cjk = it(fk). I 
 By the M-reduction in step(5) the polyno- mials joined to the basis in step(6) con- tain only kernels 
with respect to the cur- rent basis B. Buchberger proves that a se- quence it(fl),it(f2),.., with the 
property that each it(f k) is a kernel With res- pect to all it(fm), m < k, has only a fini- te number 
of elements. This property gene- ralizes an essential aspect of a degree function in a division algorithm 
and en- forces the termination of the algorithm. He also shows that the basis produced has the property 
required in Lemma(4.4). In order to apply our results of section 3 we let, for g E R, g = F(g) denote 
the result of an M-reduction with respect to a G-basis and we extend the total ordering of terms of a 
polynomial to a partial or- dering over R.  4.6 Definition : For f,h E R define < by ~it(g) < It(h), 
g < h <=> }it(g) = It(h) &#38; [red(g) < red(h) and define g ~ h by g = h or g < h.  For polynomials 
composed of the same monor mials but differing in the numerical coef- ficients the order is undefined. 
 4.5 Theorem : An M-reduction with respect to a Gr6bner basis is a computable simpli- fying ample function 
and therefore unique for all Gr~bner bases generating the same ideal. Proof: Clearly F(g) ~ g. Further 
F(g) is a polynomial containing only kernels. The re- sidue classes of kernels with respect to a G-basis 
are linearly independent by Lemma (4.4) which proves (A2). F is obviously Computable. Since during an 
M-reduction a term is always replaced by smaller terms and since addition does not produce greater terms 
we have F(g) S g proving (A3). Fi- nally, it follows from Theorem(3.6) that an M-reduction over a G-basis 
is independent of the special G-basis. [] Starting with different bases generating the same ideal the 
algorithm GBASIS produ- ces in general different G-bases {fl,...,f } and {gl .... ,gt }. However, s = 
t, it(fi)= L = it(go), after a suitable reordering of the gT's, which, too, proves the indepen- dence 
3of an M-reduction over a G-basis. The author conjectures that one obtains a unique G-basis if each 
element of a given G-basis is M-reduced with respect to the other elements.(This question has recently 
received a positive answer; see [16].~ Buchberger's algorithm applies in a re- markable way to the following 
special cases: a) if the polynomials in the given ideal bases are linear then it is the usual Gaussian 
elimination algorithm for a system of linear equations. b) for the univariate case (r = I) it computes 
simultaneously the g.c.d, of the basis polynomials, i.e. it is a ge- neralized Euclidean algorithm. 
 These observations may give a clue to an analysis of GBASIS. 5. The Case of a Principal Ideal Domain 
 (Shtokhamer's Al~orithm)  In the following we write pr.i.d, for a principal ideal domain which is an 
integral domain, too. First we make the following generaliza- tion: let S be a Noetherian integral domain, 
 i.e. an integral domain in which each ideal posesses a finite basis, and let R = S[x]. Let us further 
assume that there exist saf's for the congruence relations modulo each given ideal of S (given means 
that it is given by its basis). We will define a saf for each given ideal U of R and show its computability 
if the saf's for S are compu- table. As in the previous section we shall need a special kind of basis 
for U, namely a generalized Szekeres basis. In [9], Sze- keres constructed a canonical basis for the 
ideals of a polynomial domain in one indeterminate over a pr.i.d. Let us generalize his construction 
(as far as necessary for our purposes) to Noethe- rian rings. 5.1 Definition : Let G = (g1'''''gn) 6 
R n denote an n-tuple. If A = (a I, .,a n ) , = (b I ,...,bn) 6 R n- then n ~/~ := E aib i i=I Then 
if M = {m 1,...,m n} is a basis of an ideal U in R ,- then U = {~ 1 9 6 Rn}. 5.2 Definition : Let U 
be an idael of R. Let k be the least positive integer such that U contains a polynomial of degree k. 
 Li(U) := {0} U the set of leading coeffi- cients of all polynomials in U of degree i, i Z k. We shall 
omit the "U" if no con- fusion is possible. 5.3 Lemma : I. L i is an ideal in S for each integer i &#38; 
k. 2. L i c Li+ I for all i ~ k. Proof : trivial. Let A_.] = (a~13 ' .... a.. ) be a basis for L.3; 
 ]±3 since A~ c L~, there exists for each J J aji 6 Aj a polynomial Pji 6 R such that deg(p~i ) = 
j and the leading coefficient of pj~- is aji; let Sj = {Pjl ..... Pjlj }" 5.4 Definition : A finite 
set G. ~ U of polynomials of degree j with ]the pro- perty that the leading coefficients of the elements 
of G0 form a basis for L~ is ] called a minimal 3set (of U). 5.5 Lemma : Let G k , Gk+ I ,... be minimal 
 sets in U; n let M n := U G i . i=k Then each g 6 U with deg(g) = s ~ n has a representation s -- 
sli, g = E Ci'G i , where C. 6 and i i i=k l is the number of elements of G.. l Proof: obvious since 
the leading coeffi- cients of the elemen£s of G i form a basis for L.. An immediate consequence of 
Hilbert's ba- sis theorem is :  5.6 Lemma : There is a m 2 0 such that % is a basis for U but Mm_ 
I is not a basis. Of course the minimal sets are not uni- quely determined by U. There exists a uni- 
 queness condition for minimal sets, but for our intentions this is not necessary.  5.7 Definition 
: A basis M for an ideal U of R is called a SZ-basis if M = U G i , i=M  where the G. are minimal 
sets for U and k is the mlnlmal degree of the polynomials in U. From lemmas (5.3) and (5.3) follow the 
two properties of a SZ-basis : m  5.8 Lemma : Let M = U G i be an SZ-basis i=k for U; let G i = {gil,...,gili}, 
A i the set of leading coefficients of the elements of G.. Then : l  (I) for each gij 6 Gi, k &#38; 
i < m, there exist vectors C.. 6 S In, n = k,...,i+1, such that 13n i Cij(i+1) " Gi+1 -x'gij = E Cijn. 
 n=k n  (2) let ~. 6 S In such that C..~. = 0 for l l l some i,k < i &#38; n; then there exist vec- 
 tors Cj 6 SIs, j = k ..... i-I such that i-I Ci-G i = E C. G. j=k 3 3  The following generalization 
of a suffi- cient criterion for a basis to be a SZ-ba- sis, the algorithms for the construction of a 
SZ-basis and the ample functions are due to Shtokhamer [7], where also the omitted proofs can be found. 
 s  5.9 Theorem: Let M = U G. ~ R with the i=k l properties of Lemma(5.8). Then M is an SZ- basis 
for U=(M) Remark : If S is a pr.i.d, then the vectors ~.. of Lemma(5.8) (I) consist only of one e~ent. 
For this case Szekeres gives a uniqueness condition for an SZ-basis in terms of conditions for the C.. 
and there- by gets an enumeration of all 13n primitive ideals. His proof relies heavily on the fact that 
proposition (2) of Lemma(5.8) is trivial for pr.i.d.'s : C..A. = 0 implies C = 0 (S was assumed to ~e 
~n integral do- main). But this is not true for Noetherian domains where C i and ~. may be vectors which 
consist of mor~ than one element. Hence this part of Szekeres' construction cannot be generalized to 
Noetherian rings . We assumed the existence of saf's for  (S,-,&#38;,)where -is the congruence modulo 
an ideal and ~ is a partial ordering. Let us first extend &#38; from S to R = S[x]. 5.10 Definition 
: Let p , q 6 R. Then ~deg (p) < deg(q) p < q <=> ~deg(p) = deg(q) &#38; ic(p) < Ic(q) Ideg(p) = deg(q) 
&#38; ic(p) = ic(q) L&#38; red(p) < red(q) and p ~ q <=> p = q or p < q. Let A be an ideal in S with 
basis B = {bl,...,b }, f the corresponding saf. Then fA(s) ~ 6 A A for all s 6 S; hence there exist 
vectors ~ 6 S t such that fA(s) -s = = ~-~. Let gA be a choice function for the set of all these vectors 
C, i.e. m gA : S + S t and fA(s) -s = gA(s)-~, for  all s 6 S. m Now let M =i~ k G i be an SZ-basis 
for the ideal U in R, let fi be the saf for Li, = gLi" Let G i = {gil,...,gili } and  gi B i = red(gil),...,red(gili) 
 Let p = ax N + q E R,deg(q) < N. With these notations we define:  5.11 Definition : I p, if N < j 
 (I) f~(P)3 = f~(a)'xN3~ + f~(q3 - gj(a).~j~. N x -J) , if N a j for j = k ..... m = * ~ f~(p) 
 (2) Fu(P) fk fk+1 _ .... f~3 reduces p with respect to Gj by re-  ducing successively its coefficients 
(be- ginning with the leading coefficient) with respect to L~, but actually performing the the algebraic 
operations for the whole po- lynomials in Gj, not only for the leading coefficients. As in the previous 
section FU(P) may be considered as a generalized "remainder" of p after "division" by M.  5.12 Theorem 
: F U is a saf for (R,~,~), where ~ is the congruence modulo U and is the ordering of definition(5.10). 
 If f. has the property fi(O) = O (which by condition (A2) for saf's implies that fi(s) = 0 for all s 
6 Li), then one can easily see Fu(O) = O, too. Let us now consider the computability m aspect. If M = 
ilk G i is a given SZ-basis for U and if the fi and gi are computable then clearly F. is computable. 
 So if the Uideals A in S are detachable  (which means that the predicate s 6 A is decidable) then all 
ideals U in S[x] are detachable, and with rather basic methods we have proven a result similar to one 
of Richman [14]. Since in our application we will have S = S1[x1,~..,x ], where S. is a pr.i.d., the 
saf's L0 r will alsotrequire a spe- cial form z of the bases for L~ (namely SZ-basis). We assume therefore 
that we have an algorithm A which constructs from a gi- ven basis of an ideal in S a suitable basis 
for the corresponding saf. If we have a finite set H of polynomials in S[x] we can apply algorithm A 
to their leading coeffi- cients and perform the same algebraic ope- rations for the corresponding polynomials. 
This algorithm is called ALGOR1. Further we assume the existence of an algorithm ALGOR2 which computes 
a finite basis for the S-module V = {9 6 S n 1 9.~ = O} where B = {b.,...,b } is a basis for an ideal 
in S. (Sh{okhame9 gives such an algorithm). The following algorithm constructs from an arbitrary finite 
basis N of an ideal U a SZ-basis M for U. Let N = iU=k Hi, where the elements_j of H.I are of degree 
i; let Nj = iU=k Hi, j ~ k. For the output M we write similarly : m j M= U G i , M. = U G. i= 1 3 i= 
1 z We note that if M = M is an SZ-basis, then so is M. for all j with 1 ~ j &#38; m. According to definition 
(5.11) we denote by f~ the re- duction function corresponding to G4, and by F. tha saf for M.. We assume 
that 3 F. (O) = =30 and hence F 3. (p) = O for all p 6 M3~. If T is a set {Pl ,3..,pt} of polynomialsJthen

step(4), D = Fn_ I (f~(T)) = = F n 1(f~(Hn)) U F n 1(f~(x-G n i)), hence D ={O} implies Fn_1(f~(Hn)) 
= {O} and Fn_1(f~(x-Gn_1)) = {O}. From Fn_1 (fn (Hn)) =. = {0} follows that no polynomials are "lost" 
during the execution of the algorithm, i.e. that the output M is=a basis for the same ideal U. From Fn_1(f~(X-Gn_l)) 
= {0} follows that condition (I) of Theorem(5.9) is satis- fied. If in step(6) D = {O} then condition(2) 
is satisfied and M is an SZ-base by Theorem(5.9). If D f {O} then D ~ Mn_1, therefore the ideal generated 
by M . is a proper subset nl  of the ideal generated by M . U D Since n-I °  R = S[x] is Noetherian 
there exists no in- finite ascending chain of ideals and hence the algorithm terminates. We don't have 
a bound on the number of steps the algorithm SZBASE performs since there is no explicit bound on the 
length of an ascending chain of ideals in Noetherian rings. In [12] Sei- denberg gives a bound, but it 
is a multi- recursive function, and he furthermore works over a field (see also [13]); so his result 
doesn't solve the complexity problem for the above algorithm. If S = S.[x., .,x .] where S I is a / 
I "" --| ' pr.i.d., the algorithm A mentlon~d above will actually be a recursive call of SZBASE. As 
the recursion base we have S = $i, and we must assume that we can compute saf's for S . If S I = Z, the 
suitable basis is the gad of the elements of the given basis, and we may take fl or f9 from section (3) 
as a saf for Z together'with the corres- ponding ordering ~I ~2 ) 6. Open questions We have already 
mentioned that we don't know a general bound on the number of steps both algorithms perform. Further 
questions are : a) how can Buchberger's algorithm be ap- plied if the coefficient domain is a pr.i.d, 
instead of a field? The definition of an M-reduction has an obvious generalization, and also the algorithm 
terminates.  b) how does Shtokhamer's algorithm behave if all input polynomials are linear in total 
degree? c) can one find conditions for an ideal to be contained in another ideal in terms of conditions 
for their bases ( G-bases or SZ-bases ) ? Math. Monthly 59, (1952) (379-386)  [10] G.E. Collins, Algebraic
