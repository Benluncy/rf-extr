 Barbie as Rapunzel Once upon a time, in the world of computer animation there lived a sphere and a cube. 
They were unenlightened and were used everywhere. Along came 10 years of experience with many new tools 
and the cube and sphere were reshaped. They became organic, with movement, hair, and soft textures. This 
transÂ­formation was truly magical and scientific, pretty as a painting with emotion and life. Such is 
the world of Barbie and Ken. Producer: Windlight Studios Client: Mattel Inc. Director of Creative Advertising
