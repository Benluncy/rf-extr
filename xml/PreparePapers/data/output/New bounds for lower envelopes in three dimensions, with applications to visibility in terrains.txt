 New Bounds for Lower Envelopes in Three Dimensions, with Applications to Visibility in Terrains* Dan 
Halperint Abstract We consider the problem of bounding the complexity of the lower envelope of n surface 
patches in 3-space, all al­gebraic of constant maximum degree, and bounded by algebraic arcs of constant 
maximum degree, with the additional property that the interiors of any triple of these surfaces intersect 
in at most two points. We show that the number of vertices on the lower envelope of n 2 , Zcfi such 
surface patches is O(n ), for some con­stant c depending on the shape and degree of the surface patches. 
We apply this result to obtain an upper bound on the combinatorial complexity of the lower envelope of 
the space of all rays in 3-space that lie above a given polyhedral terrain K with n edges. This envelope 
con­sists of all rays that touch the terrain (but otherwise lie above it). We show that the combinatorial 
com­ plexity of this ray-envelope is O(n 3. 2 =) for some constant c; in particular, there are at most 
that many rays that paas above the terrain and touch it in 4 edges. This bound, combined with the analysis 
of de Berg et al. [2], gives an upper bound (which is almost tight in the worst case) on the number of 
topologically-dif ferent orthographic views of such a terrain. *Work on this paper by the first author

1.50 Micha Sharir*  1 Introduction Let X= {al,..., an} be a given collection of n surface patches in 
3-space. This paper addresses the problem of boun,ding the combinatorial complexity of the lower envelops 
(pointwise minimum) of the surface patches in X. Assume for simplicity that each Ui is the graph of a 
partially-defined function z = f i(~, Y), and that these functions, as well as the curves delimiting 
the patches, are all algebraic of constant maximum degree, and that the given surfaces are in general 
position. The lower envelope, when projected onto the zy-plane, generates a planar map M, called the 
minimization diagram of 2 [13], with the property that over each face of M the envelope is attained by 
a single patch (or by no patch at all), over each edge the envelope is attained by two patches simultaneously 
or by the boundary of a single patch, and over each vertex of M the envelope is attained by three patches 
simultaneously, or by the intersection of the boundary of one patch with another patch, or by a point 
on the boundary of one patch which lies directly below the boundary of another patch, or be­low an intersection 
curve of two other patches (so that this higher point is vertically visible from the point on the lower 
boundary), or by a vertex of a patch boundary (a point where two arcs forming this boundary meet). The 
combinatorial complexity of the envelope is defined simply as the overall number of faces, edges, and 
ver­tices of .M, and is denoted by q!@), Under the assumptions made above, it is easy to show that 4(X) 
= 0(n3) (with a constant of proportionality that depends on the algebraic degree of the patches and of 
their boundaries). However, it has been conjectured over the past seven years that the maximum possible 
complexity of such an envelope is only about quadratic in n. The conjecture is motivated by the fact 
that in 2 dimensions, in the case of the lower envelope of n partially-defined univariate functions, 
sharp bounds are known for the complexity of the envelope, measured simply in terms of the number of 
breakpoints along the envelope. If each pair of the functions intersect in at most s points, then the 
complexity of their envelope is at mc)st &#38;+2(n), which is the maximum length of Davenport-Schinzel 
sequences of order s + 2 composed of n symbols (see [1, 10] for more details), and is only slightly super-linear 
in n for any fixed s. The conjecture in 3 dimensions attempts to extend this bound, and as­serts that 
the complexity of the envelope is O(nA, (n)), for some constant s depending on the degree and shape of 
the given patches. The conjecture appears to be ex­tremely difficult, and has been proven for families 
of only a few types of surfaces or surface patches, such as planes, balls, triangles, and a few other 
types (see [11, 13]). The problem in general has been wide open; in fact, no general bounds better than 
O(n3) were known so far. In this paper we obtain a subcubic bound for the com­plexity ~(~), provided 
the given surface patches are such that the interiors of any three of them intersect in at most two points. 
In fact, our bound is close to quadratic, so we almost establish the conjecture in this special case. 
This property holds in several applications. As a matter of fact, if the given surfaces had this prop­erty 
and were full surfaces without boundary, then the results of [13] would imply (with a few additional 
mild assumptions) that the complexity of their envelope is O(n2). However, the fact that they are surface 
patches makes the analysis more difficult, and this bound is not known in that case. Our main result 
is that, under the above assumptions, the complexity of the lower envelope of these surfaces is 0(n2 
. 2c&#38; f some that, on ), or constant c depends the degree and shape of the given surfaces. The proof 
is not difficult, and relies on the randomized technique of [6, 14] for obtaining generalized (< k)-set 
bounds in arrangements. This result still leaves a small gap from the conjectured complexity, but is 
nevertheless a signifi­cant and rather decisive step towards the establishment of the conjecture. In 
a forthcoming paper [15] the technique presented in this paper is extended to obtain similar, almost-tight 
bounds in more general setups, both when the maxi­mum number of points of intersection between a triple 
of surfaces can be larger than 2 (but still remain a con­stant), and when the dimension is larger than 
3. Our result was motivated by, and has an interest­ing application to, the problem mentioned in the 
abs­tract, namely, the problem of bounding the conlbina.­ torial complexity of the lower envelope of 
the space of all rays in 3-space that lie above a given polyhedral ter­rain K with n edges. This envelope 
consists of all rays that touch the terrain (but otherwise lie above it). We show that the combinatorial 
complexity of the envelope is 0(n3 . 2c@) for some constant c; in particular, there are at most that 
many rays that pass above the terrain and touch it in 4 edges. This bound is derived by applying the 
3-D envelope result n times, each time fixing an edge e of K and considering the 3-dimensional space 
of all lines (or rays) that touch e but otherwise pass above K. It is fairly easy to show (and will indeed 
be shown in Section 3) that the conditions required by our analysis hold in this application. Our bound 
for the complexity of the space of lines passing above a terrain was recently, and independently, obtained 
by Pellegrini [12], but it is not clear whether his result can be ex­tended to the space of rays passing 
above a terrain. This bound on the complexity of the envelope of the space of rays over a terrain has 
an interesting ap­plication to the problem of bounding the number of topologically-different orthographic 
views of such a ter­rain. A recent study by de Berg et al. [2] gives a bound of 0(n5 . 2afnJ) for this 
number, but unfortunately their argument turned out to be erroneous. A careful (and correct ) restatement 
of the result of de Berg et al. is that the bound on the number of topologically-different or­thographic 
views of a terrain is O(n~q(n)p(n)), where p(n) is the maximum complexity of the ray-envelope of a terrain 
with n edges. Plugging in our bound for p(n), we get the bound 0(n5 . 2C@) for the number of views, for 
some absolute constant c. Except for a remaining small factor, this result almost mat ches the upper 
bound originally asserted in [2], and, as shown in [2], is almost tight in the worst case. 2 Lower Envelopes 
in 3-Space Let X= {al,..., an} be a given collection of n surface patches in 3-space that satisfy the 
following conditions: (i) Each Ci is monotone in the ~~-direction (that is, ev­ery vertical line intersects 
uj in at most one point). Moreover, each ua is a portion of an algebraic sur­face of constant maximum 
degree d. (ii) The vertical projection of Ui onto the zg+plane is a planar region bounded by a constant 
number of algebraic arcs of constant maximum degree (say, d too).  (iii) The relative interiors of any 
triple of the given surfaces intersect in at most 2 points. (iv) The surface patches in Z are in generai 
position. This excludes degenerate configurations where four surfaces meet at a point, the boundaries 
of two sur­ faces meet, the boundary of one surface meets an intersection curve of two other surfaces, 
a pair of surfaces are tangent to each other, a singular point on one surface lies on the boundary of 
another sur­face or on an intersection curve between two other surfaces, etc. ) Conditions (i)-(iii) 
are essential for the analysis, while condition (iv) is made to simplify the forthcoming ar­guments. 
It involves no real loss of generality, because, as can be shown (see the forthcoming paper [15] for 
details), the maximum complexity of the envelope is achieved, up to a constant factor, when the given 
sur­faces are in general position. We also note that the first part of Condition (i) is not essential, 
because we can always cut a surface u along the constant number of arcs which are the loci of points 
on u having vertical tangency, to obtain a constant number of zy-monotone surfaces whose union is u. 
The lower envelope of 2 is the graph of the (partial) function z = Ex(z, y) that maps each point (z, 
y) to the height of the lowest point of intersection between the vertical line through (z, y) and the 
surfaces in X (if that line meets no surface, the function is undefined at (z, y)). If we project E onto 
the zy-plane we obtain a planar map, denoted by M = ME, having the proper­ties stated in the Introduction. 
Theorem 2.1 The combinatorial compleziiy +(E) of the lower envelope of a collection E of n surface patches 
that satisfy conditions (i)-(iv), is O(nz . 2%6G ), for some constant c that depends on the degree d 
and the shape of the given surfaces. Proofi Let us denote by +(n) the maximum value of rJ(4X), taken 
over all collections Z of n surface patches that satisfy conditions (i)-(iv) (for a fixed degree d). 
We distinguish between inner vertices of the enve­lope, namely, vertices of the envelope that are inter­section 
points of the relative interiors of three surface patches in X, and the remaining outer vertices. Con­sider 
first the outer vertices. Let us assume general po­sition, and ignore the O(n) original vertices of the 
given patches, and the 0(n2 ) points of intersection between the boundary of one surface patch and the 
relative in­terior of another patch. Then any other outer vertex is formed either when the boundary of 
one surface patch passes above the boundary of another patch, or when an intersection curve of two patches 
passes above the boundary of a third patch. The number of outer ver­tices of the first kind is clearly 
O(rz2 ). As to outer ver­tices of the second kind, fix a surface patch a c X. We claim that the total 
number of such vertices that lie on the boundary of the fixed a is 0(~g+2 (n)), for some constant q depending 
on the degree and shape of the surfaces. This is shown as in [3, 5]: Let y be one of the (constant number 
of) algebraic arcs that form the boundary of u, and let II be the vertical surface formed by the union 
of all vertical rays whose bottom endpoints lie on -y. For each surface u~ E 2 {a}, let &#38; = ui (1 
I+. The properties that the surfaces satisfy imply that each 6i is the union of a constant number of 
connected arcs, and that each pair of such arcs intersect in at most some constant number, q, of points. 
It is easily checked that, each of the vertices under consideration must arise aa a breakpoint in the 
lower envelope of the arcs &#38;, over one of the boundary pieces y of u. Hence the total number of such 
endpoints is 0(&#38;+2(n)) [10], as asserted. Sum­ming over all u E X, the total number of outer vertices 
of the second kind is 0(n&#38;+2(n)). Hence the number of outer vertices of all kinds is ~ nearly quadratic 
and smaller than the bound asserted in the theorem. The number of edges of Mz that do not contain i~ny 
vertex at all is also easily seen to be 0(n2). Thus, if we establish the bound in the theorem for the 
number of inner vertices, and apply Euler s formula for planar maps, we easily conclude that the same 
bound also holds for the total complexity of Mx. Let p be an inner vertex of the lower envelope, formed 
by the intersection of (the relative interiors of) three sur­face patches cr~ ,av ,a~. By condition (iii), 
these patches intersect in at most one more point, so that, with no loss of generality, we can assume 
that there is no such intersection in the halfspace z > z(p). By the general position assumption, we 
may assume that p is not a sin­gular point of any of these patches, and that they meet each other transversally 
at p. Then, locally near p, the lower envelope is approximated by the lower envelope of the three tangent 
planes to au ,cr ,cr~ at p. In par­ticular, leach of the intersection curves ~ = au n au, T.w = u. n 
C7w,T.w = u. n Uw contains a maximal con­nected x-monotone arc that emanates from p and is hid­den from 
below by the third surface. Let P.. ,Aw ,Aw denote these respective arcs, and let .zti~ ,zUW ,z.W denote 
the other endpoints of these arcs. It also follows that the positive span of the zy-projections of the 
three outgoing tangent directions of /3Uv ,,BUW,/3Vw is the entire xy-plane: indeed, ihe three vectors 
oppositely oriented to these di­rections lie along the edges emerging from p of the lower envelope of 
the three tangent planes to the surfaces at p, and the xy-projections of these vectors cannot lie in 
a single haJf-plane, as is easily checked. Hence at least one of these arcs, say /3UW, emanates from 
p in the positive x-direction. Two cases can arise: (a) .zUW is an endpoint of (some connected z-monotone 
portion of) -yti W.In this case we charge p to zti~. Our assumptions imply that each yWW has only a constant 
number of such endpoints, so the total number of such charges will be proportional to the total number 
of in­tersection curves, namely 0(n2). (b) ZUW is a point along yUW that lies directly above the boundary 
of au (see Figure 1). The difficulty is that Zuw need not be vertically visible from duo there may be 
many other surfaces lying below z W and above the boundary (the boundary itself need not be on the lower 
envelope at this point, but this will not concern us in the analysis given below). Suppose there are 
tsuch surfaces. we fix some threshold parameter k, to be determined  the f surfaces lying below v. Hence, 
we have Figure 1: Case (b) of the proof ZUW lies above the bound­ary of au. The envelope is shown from 
below; solid edges are visible whereas dashed edges are hidden from the en­velope. shortly, and consider 
the following two subcases: (b.i) t > k: Extend each surface a G 2 to a surface u by erecting an upward-directed 
vertical ray from each point on the boundary of a. Let Z denote the collec­tion of these extended surfaces, 
and let A(E* ) denote their arrangement. Our assumption implies that /3,,W contains at least tvertices 
of A(X* ), and we will charge p to the block of the first k of these vertices in their or­der from p 
to ZUW along ~UW. (Indeed, for any extended surface u* that hides ZUW from &#38;rV, we trace ~VW from 
p towards .ZUW; since U* does not lie below p but lies below ZUW, there has to be a point along ~uW where 
this curve intersects a , yielding a vertex of A(S* ) along ~~~.) Clearly, each vertex of A(X*) can be 
charged in this manner only a constant number of times. Define the level of a point x of 3-space in 
A(X* ) to be the number of surfaces of X* that lie strictly below z (which is the same aa the number 
of original surfaces in Z that lie below z). It is easily checked that each of the charged vertices along 
@.W is at level at most k (indeed, as we trace ~UW from p to ZUW, the level can change (by +1) only when 
we cross one of these vertices). Our goal is thus to obtain an upper bound for the number of vertices 
of A(E* ) that lie at level ~ k. For this we apply the analysis technique of [6, 14]. That is, we choose 
a random sample 7? of r = n/k surfaces of X , and construct their arrangement A(7Z). Let v be a vertex 
of A(Z* ) at level < ~ k. The probability that v shows up as a vertex of the lower envelope En of the 
surfaces in 7? is (n~~~3) / ~): out of the total number ~) of possible samples, those that make v app­ear 
as such a vertex are precisely those that contain the three surfaces defining v and do not contain any 
of &#38; ,=, (n-ti3) ; ? v) FC < +(X) ~ #(r) , where F( is the number ~. This can be rewritten of vertices 
as u of A(Z* ) at level < *(T) , or n r k+l k n(n l)(n 2) 5Ff ~ .(, _~)(r _2)$( ) . n k 2 ~=o  
( )() As in [6, 14], one easily verifies that for r = n/k we have SF,=0(k3@(n/k)) ; f=o in other words, 
the number of vertices of A(Z* ) at level < k is 0(k3r#(n/k)), which in turn implies that the number 
of inner vertices p of E~ in this subcaae is 0(k2@(n/k)). (b.ii) t< k: Let cr. be the algebraic arc on 
the boundary of U~ which lies below ZUW, and let HV be the vertical surface formed by the union of all 
vertical rays whose bottom endpoints lie on Qv. For each surface ui # Uv, let &#38; = ui n H.. As above, 
the properties that the surfaces satisfy imply that each Ji is the union of a con­stant number of connected 
arcs, and that each pair of such arcs intersect in at most q points. Clearly, the point ZUW must be a 
vertex of the 2-D arrangement &#38; of the arcs &#38;i within H.. Moreover, the level of ZUW in dV, defined, 
in complete analogy to the definition in the preceding sub case, as the number of arcs that in­tersect 
the downward-directed ray emanating from ZUW (or, rather, the downward-directed segment from ZUW to av 
), is at most k. We can thus apply Theorem 1.3 of [14], which is proved using a random-sampling argument 
similar to the one in the preceding subcase, and which asserts that the maximum number of vertices at 
level at most k in such an arrangement is O(k2&#38;+2 (n/k)). Hence the number of vertices ZUW, over 
all choices of au and UW but with a fixed a., is 0(k2Aq+2(n/k)). We charge p to Zu~; since each such 
ZWW can be charged in this manner only a constant number of times, it follows that the overall number 
of inner vertices in the present subcase is 0(nk2Ag+2(n/k)) = 0(rdtJq+2(rz)) . Thus, if we add all the 
bounds obtained so far, includ­ing those for the number of outer vertices, we obtain the following recurrence 
for @: ~(n) < Ak2q$(n/k) + Ank&#38;+2(n) , (1) for some absolute positive constant A. We claim that the 
solution to this recurrence is ~(ra) < n2 .2 = , (2) for a sufficiently large constant c. The proof is 
by induc­tion on n. First, by choosing c sufficiently large, we can assume that (2) holds for all n < 
no, where no is chosen so that Aq+2(n) ~ % .2 G for all n > nO (this is al­ ways possible by the results 
of [1]). For n > no, choose k = 2( -1)-. The inequality (1) and the induction hypothesis imply that ~(n) 
~ Ak2(n/k)2 . 2 S + Ank&#38;+2(TZ) , so it suffices to show that Iogn-(c-l)@ + ~ . 2C@ < 2cJGG A . 2=4 
2 or that (c-l) @<c@ -(l+logA), which is easily seen to hold provided we choose c > 1+ {~. This completes 
the proof of the The­orem. U 3 The Envelope of Lines or Rays Over a Terrain Let K be a polyhedral terrain 
in 3-space; that is, K is a continuous piecewise-linear surface intersecting each vertical line in exactly 
one point. Suppose K has n edges. A line / is said to lie over K if every point on 1 lies on or above 
K. Let LK denote the space of all lines that lie over K. The lower envelope of L K consists of those 
lines that touch at least one edge of K. Assuming general position of the edges of K, a line in LK (or 
any line for that matter) can touch at most 4 edges of K. Our goal is to analyze the combinatorial complexity 
of the lower envelope, but to simplify matters (and with no loss of generality) we only count the number 
of its vertices, namely those lines that touch 4 distinct edges of K. We show: Theorem 3.1 The number 
of vertices of ~K, as de­fined above, is O(n3 .2 C@) for some absolute positive constant c. Proofi We 
fix an edge e. of K, and bound the number of lines of EK that touch e. and three other edgea of K, with 
the additional proviso that these three other contact points all lie on one fixed side of the vertical 
plane passing through e.. We then multiply this bound by the number n of edges to obtain a bound on the 
overall number of vertices of ~K. We want to rephrase this prc)blem in terms of the lower envelope of 
a certain collection of surface patches in 3-space, one patch for each other edge of K, to which we will 
apply the results of the previous section. The space Z.O of oriented lines that touch e. is 3­dimensional: 
each such line f can be specified by a triple (t,k,C),,t is the point of contact with eo (or, more where 
precisely, the distance of that point from one designated endpoint of co), and k = tan t?, ~ = -cot ~, 
where (0, ~) are the spherical coordinates of the direction of f?, that is, d is the orientation of the 
x~projection of 1, and ~ is the angle between / and the positive z-axis. For each edge e # e. of K let 
u. be the surface patch in ZeO consisting of all points (t, k, () representing lines that touch e and 
are oriented from e. to e. Note that if (t,k,I()E de then C > < iff the line (t, k,c ) passes below e. 
It thus follows that a line t in ,CeO is a vertex of the k)wer envelope of ~K if and Ody if t k a Vr?rk?X 
of the lower envelope of the surfaces ue in the tk<-space, where the height of a point is its <-coordinate. 
Hence, it remains to show that these surfaces satisfy conditions (i)-(iv) of the previous section, and 
then the theorem will easily follow from Theorem 2.1. Condition (i) requires each Ue to be monotone in 
the tk-direction, which is immediate by definition; the al­gebraicity and the constant degree of these 
surfaces is also easy to verify. The vertical projection of a~ onto the tk-plane is easily seen to be 
the intersection of two double wedges it is the set dual to the set of all lines in the zy-plane that 
intersect the zy-projections of eo and e, under an appropriate (and standard) duality. Hence condition 
(ii) is also satisfied. (Since this projection may be disconnected, we may want to replace each ue by 
a constant number of sub-patches, so that the tk­projection of each sub-patch is a convex polygon of 
at most 4 sides. ) Condition (iii), which is the crucial one, follows from the observation that a point 
of intersection of the relative interiors of 3 surfaces ue,, aez, ue~, corre­sponds to a line that passes 
through the four edges eo, el, e2 and e3, and it is well known that there can be at most two such lines, 
assuming that these four edges are in general position. Condition (iv) can be enforced by assuming the 
terrain K to be in general position. Hence, putting everything together and applying Theorem 2.1, we 
readily obtain the bound asserted in the theorem. 0 Remarlks: (1) The bound of Theorem 3.1 has been in­dependently 
obtained by Pellegrini [12], using a different proof technique. (2) The best lower bound that weknow 
for the com­plexity of the envelope of CK is f2(n2@2(n)), which is obtained by taking two sets S1, S2 
of n/2 segments each, so that all segments in S1 (resp. S2) lie in a common plane Ifl (resp. Hz) parallel 
to the zz-plane, and so that the upper envelope of each set consists of t3(ncY(n)) subsegments. We can 
then translate each seg­ment very slightly so that they all now lie in different parallel planes, and 
complete the resulting collection of segments into a polyhedral terrain K for which the com­plexity of 
the envelope LK satisfies the asserted lower bound. We can extend the result of Theorem 3.1 as follows. 
Let K be a terrain as above. Let ~K denote the space of all rays in 3-space with the property that each 
point on such a ray lies on or above K. We define the lower envelope of ??K and k vertices in complete 
analogy to the case of ~K. By inspecting the proof of Theorem 3.1, one easily verifies that it applies 
equally well to rays instead of lines. This is because, after fixing an edge e., each ray-vertex of %?K 
under consideration, when extended into a full line, becomes a line-vertex of LK. , where K* is the portion 
of K cut off by a half space bounded by the vertical plane through e.. Hence we obtain: Corollary 3.2 
The number of vertices of ~K, as de­ 3. ydq. jined above, is also O(n This corollary will be needed 
in the following subsec­tion. 3.1 The Number of Orthographic Views of a Polyhedral Terrain We next apply 
Theorem 3.1 to obtain a bound on the number of topologically-different orthographic views (i.e., views 
from infinity) of a polyhedral terrain K with n edges. This problem has been studied by de Berg et al. 
[2]. However, there is a certain technical error in their analysis (which we explain below). As mentioned 
above, a correct form of the bound is O(n&#38;(n)p(n)), where p(n) is the complexity of the ray-envelope 
of a terrain with n edges. In this subsection we explain the connection between p(n) and the bound on 
the number of views, and, using the result of the previous subsec­ 5 . Qc @G), tion, we conclude that 
this bound is O(n for a constant c slightly larger than c. Following the analysis of [2], each orthographic 
view of K can be represented as a point on the sphere at infinity S2. For each triple (el, e2, e3) of 
edges of K we consider the locus Y(el ,eQ,~~) of views for which these three edges appear to be concurrent 
(that is, there exists a line parallel to the viewing direction which touches these three edges); each 
such locus is a curve along S2. We next replace each curve -y = ~(., ,e,,e.) aS above by its maximal 
visible portions; a point on y is said to be visible if the corresponding line that touches the three 
edges el, ez, es either lies over K or else penetrates below K only at points that lie further away from 
its contacts with the edges el, e2, e3; in other words, we require the existence of a ray in the viewing 
direction that touches el, e2, and e3 but otherwise lies fully above K. As is easily verified, each visible 
portion of y is delimited either at an original endpoint of 7 or at a point whose corresponding ray is 
a vertex of %?K. Hence, by Corollary 3.2, the total number of the visible portions of the loci ~ is 0(n3. 
2c@). We refer to these visible portions as arcs of visible triple-contact views. We now continue along 
the lines of the analysis of [2]. That is, we consider the arrangement of the arcs of vis­ible triple-contact 
views, and observe that the number of views that we seek to bound is proportional to the complexity of 
the arrangement of these arcs within S2. We next apply a result of Cole and Sharir [7], which, rephrased 
in the context under discussion, states that each meridian of S2 crosses at most k = 0(nJ4(rz)) arcs. 
As shown in [2], this implies that the complexity of the arrangement of these arcs is O(ZVk), where N 
is the number of arcs. Hence we obtain Corollary 3.3 The number of topologically-di fferent orthographic 
views of a polyhedral terrain with n edges is 0(n4A4(n) . 2 =) = O(n5 o2C 6) , for c slightly larger 
than c. Remarks: (1) The technical error in [2] is that they considered the arrangement of the entree 
10CI Y(el ,~2, ~3), whereas, for the result of [7] to apply, one has to con­sider, as done above, only 
their visible portions. (2) de Berg et al. [2] also give a lower bound of Q(nscr(rz)) for the number 
of topologically-different or­thographic views of a polyhedral terrain with n edges. Thus the above upper 
bound is almost tight in the worst case. (3) The manuscript [2] also analyzes the number of topologically-different 
perspective views of a polyhedral terrain. Again they make the same technical error noted above, except 
that now they have to consider an ar­rangement of surface patches in 3-space rather than an arrangement
