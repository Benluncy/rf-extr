Major advances in simulation techniques have in the past resulted from refineeent of our understanding 
of the modeling process itself, The encapsulation of frequently used functions into standard packages 
gave rise to the original simulation languages. The recognition of frequently used concepts gave rise 
to current ~odel-based simulation systees. The separation of the model frame from the experimental frame 
is just beginning to see impleeenfation in commercially available decision support systems. He believe 
the next major advance Nill coee free a better understanding of the relationship between the representation 
(or description) of the system itself and the models/experiments which are performed to satisfy a particular 
goal, Ne are currently Norking towards a modeling paradigm in which a sysfee specification frame and 
a goal specification frame are for~ally recognized as distinct fro= the simulation modeling, experimental, 
and i~pleeenfation frames. OVERVIEN Simulations represent an implementation of a design (often referred 
to as the simulation model) in a particular prograMing language within an experimental frame. Current 
activities in simulation |aoguages and simulation development environments have focused on the model 
design and impleeentation resulting in significant improvements in both areas. The problem Nhich Ne are 
concerned with, however, is the process of problem analysis and environment specification, The development 
of an appropriate model structure and experimental design depends on the goals of the analysis study 
and on the structure of the systee being analyzed. ~e believe significant benefits can be derived free 
modeling of these goals and systo= structures from a sysfee description point of viee using requireeents 
modeling techniques, and then automatically translating these descriptions into simulation odels with 
appropriate experimental designs. In order to accomplish this, one mJSt understand the relationships 
between the world modeling viewpoints of both disciplines. Ne have analyzed seventeen different world 
modeling structures. Roughly half from information and requirements modeling methods, the others from 
existing simulation =mdeling methods. Ne are developing a formalization for the classification of the 
lodeling constructs and for the generation of translations between constructs. PREMISE Since the initial 
creation of simulation languages (essentially si~ulatlon function ~acros) a considerable amount of research 
effort has been directed teeards creating better ~ays for the end user of a simulation to directly express 
his observations of the systee dynamics and then have a simulation performed of these dynamics over time. 
Unfortunately most of the work to date has not looked at hay the user actually thinks about the systee 
dynamics. Rather most of the effort has been spent in taking advantage of advances in terminal graphics 
capabilities and interactive forms driven or com~nd driven prngraeeing. These efforts have improved interfaces 
to existing modeling techniques and represent a valuable technology; however, the process of gathering 
a users description of the environment and translating that into a sl=ulafable form is still largely 
an unexplored area, If significant in-roads are to be made in bringing simNJlation to wide spread use 
by non-si~laf~on analysts then the following problems ~ust be addressed: I) Users ~st be able to describe 
their systems in a form Nhich is natural with respect to the way they think about their environment. 
2) Systems must be constructed which interact with the users as they provide this description in a consulting 
mode to help thee provide the information required to actually perform the simulation, 3) Users must 
be able to describe desired experiments in the form of 'what if' scenarios as they conceptualize these 
ideas. 4) The system muJst be able to provide necessary consultation to the users to elicit free thee 
sufficient information to be able to evaluate the rwhaf if' scenarios using simulation as the exper i~ental 
tool. 5) The simulation soft,are systems must be able to directly tie into the manufacturing or business 
data bases and extract the volumes of information which today are generally hand loaded (or worse yet 
encoded into the structure of the model). Richard J. Mayer, Robert E. Young GOALS The ultimate goals 
of this effort are: 1) Develop a system which could help a user construct his own model of his environment 
(i.e., provide better abstraction features for the end user.) 2) Translate that model automatically into 
a si~4Jlatable form. 3) Assist the user in formulating both solution concepts, and analysis strategies 
for evaluating those concepts within a simulation framework. APPROACH The approach that has been taken 
consists of the following activities: 1) Identify the objects, concepts, language subset, and grammar 
structures used by manufacturing personnel in describing their problem domain. 2) Identify the concepts 
of ~odeling typically used by operations and line manageeent in a manufacturing situation. 3) Analyze 
existing 'world models' (semantic data models) in the literature which are used to model information 
in a users environment. 4) Characterize these semantic 'world models' with existing simulation 'world 
models' found in the literature. 5) Analyze existing simulation languages and system dynamics modeling 
languages to ascertain Nhaf constructs they support. 6) Analyze existing systems/methods for natural 
language processing particularly the development techniques used for determining: a. The allowable categories 
and subcategories of the words and the lexicon of categorized words. b. The grammar rules and definitions 
of well formed text in discourse analysis.  c. The analysis procedure (or parsing approach) used. d. 
The procedure for associating semantic actions with the parse and executing those actions.  7) Investigate 
the confusion of inferencing versus simulation versus optimization typical in user generated 'what if' 
questions. 8) Oesign and construct a prototype system to translate natural language descriptions of manufacturing 
situations and 'what if' scenarios into a formal system specification. 9) Design and construct a prototype 
system for translation of the systeql specifications into a simulation model design. Pr2~ress/Status 
Efforts to date directed toMards activities I, 2, and 6 have focused on performing discourse analysis 
of seven natural English syste~ description using the cohesion and linguistic analysis techniques described 
in [Halliday 76]. This analysis identifies the cohesive items used, their types, and as a side effect, 
the primary concept and object classes. Efforts to date directed towards activities 3, 4, and 5 have 
focused on documenting and classifying the world ~odeling structures. The fra~e~ork Ne are developing 
for translation between these different views is based on six concepts: Real=s, Objects, Properties, 
Events, States, and Binding agents. Efforts to date directed to~ards activities 7, 8, and 9 have focused 
on the functional design of the system and the granular specification for the languages required. Ne 
currently see the need for four different language structures: a) A restricted subset of natural English. 
b) An object oriented natural language used to interact with the user. c) A formal system specification 
language. d) A simulation modeling language. He have constructed a prototype parser for the natural language 
processing, and we are working on the generation of the object oriented language descriptions. REFERENCES
