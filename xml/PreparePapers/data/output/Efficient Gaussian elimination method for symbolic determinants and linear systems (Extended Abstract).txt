 Let s be an nxn symbolic matrix: efficiently without causing such an inter- mediate expression swell. 
M = (aij), l~i,j~n. (i) The idea is quite simple. In formula The conventional Gaussian elimination 
(2), H(.k.+I) is given as the quotient of method calculates the determinant of M by 23 the two polynomials. 
Suppose the denomi- the following iteration formula: nator .(k-l) has a unique term u. Then mk-I k-i

quotient. Hence, we try to calculate step, k~i_<n, ksj_<n, and M(1)=M. M (0) is M(.k+. I) by calculating 
only the terms pro- 00 ;3 defined to be i. After the (n-l)th elimi-portional to u in the numerator

idea is actually realized Although the formula (2) is quite in the following way. First, let us efficient

Method for Symbolic Determinants and Linear Systems .(k-l) The Mk_ 1 k-i is the determinant of the top-leftmost 
(k-l)x(k-l) minor (a princi- pal minor) of M, and it is a polynomial of degree k-i containing the highest 
degree term XiX2...Xk_ 1 when viewed w.r.t, vari-ables x., .... x . Hence, we can divide 1 2 n k -" 
(-i) . (XiX2...Xk_ I) by Mk_ 1 k-l" 2_n(k-l) M (k-l) +R(k-l) (5) (XlX2"--Xk_ I) -4 "~-i k-i where 
Q(k-l) and R (k-l) are the quotient and the remainder, respectively, and the division is made by treating 
Xl, .... Xk_ 1 as main variables. Note that R (k-l) does not contain any term which is proportional 
to XlX2...Xk_ I, although it may contain terms which are of degree greater than k-2 in x I, ..., Xk_ 
I. By multiplying both sides of Eqs. (2) and (5), we get (k+l) 2 M ij (XlX2"''Xk-l) = (~k" (k) _ 
M (k)ik M (kk~) Q (k-l) (k)niJ'" . (k+l) R (k-l) + m ij (6) Since s(k+l) is linear in each of ij 
(k-l) does not x I , .... , Xk_l, and since R contain any term proportional to XlX2...Xk_l, the rightmost 
term in Eq. (6) does not give any term proportional to (xix2...X._l)2.~_~ Therefore, Eq.(6) means that 
M(~[ x) can be calculated by taking zj out all terms that are proportional to .. (k). (k) .(k) .(k).

 Note that we are interested only in poly- nomials which are linear in each of the .(k) main variables 
because so is m... Being applied to polynomials P and which are linear in the main variables x I ..... 
x n and represented as (7), our multiplication operator works as follows: 1  i+l ' for i ~ k. (8) 
 This relation defines our special multi- plication recursive~y. The ~ becomes a usual multiplication 
operator for the variables Xk+l,Xk+2, ..., X n and other variables. The above multiplication opertor 
u allows us to calculate Q(k-l) in Eq. (5) . (k-l) efficiently. Let us decompose ~-I k-i as Mk(_k~lk)_l

Let A and s be nxn and nxm matrices: A = (aij), B = (bij)-  The conventional Gaussian elimination method 
for solving the equation AZ = B, Z = (zij), l~i~n, l~j~m is as follows. Let M be the following augmented 
matrix: I al I -. aln bll --blm S = : : : : anl . ann bnl -. brim In the first step, the left n columns 
of M are upper-triangularized by the same elim- ination method as that for determinant: a{l . a'in

formula n bV. = (Db!. -~ a' ~" ~I=, z3 z3 ik-kj''~ii l~j~m, k=i+l  where i is changed successively 
as n-l, n-2 ..... I. Then the solution matrix z is given by zij = b~/D._ Here, we encounter the exact 
division again. Hence, our efficient method for elimina- tion is applicable not only in the upper- triangularization 
step (12) but also in the diagonalization step (13). The following table shows empirical test of our 
algorithm. The test problems are (i) determinant of Vandermonde matrix i-i Mij : aj (2) determinant
