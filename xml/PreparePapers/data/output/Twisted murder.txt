 Twisted Murder Scientific Visualization contact Paulo de Almada almada@dealmada.com USA Detective Alex 
is looking forward to his impending nuptials, until he receives a shocking phone call revealing that 
his soon-to-be wife has been murdered. Who would want to kill beautiful Melinda? Was it a case of mistaken 
identity, or did she have a double life? Did he even know the woman he was to marry? With nothing to 
go on, Alex desperately tries to piece the mystery together. The journey takes him to the seedy underworld 
of Fresno, where a series of twisted clues and heavy drinking lead him to her unlikely, possibly inhuman, 
killer and an even more twisted romantic ending. Director Sound Design Acknowledgement Paulo de Almada
