When studying problems falling into such areas as image processing, computer vision and graphics, and 
computational geometry, The mesh structure, i.e., 2-D array of processors, often stands out as a natural 
choice for the problem representation [11]. In a mesh-connected computer, just like in any computer with 
a distributed memory architecture, we often have to send data among, perhaps far *Address corresponds

apart, processors. Evidently, the basis of such data transmission is to send packets between any arbi- 
trary but fixed pair of processors in the network structure. It is certainly desirable to send data packets 
along the shortest path between the source and the destination. However, because of the in- creasingly 
heavy traffic, inherently limited band- width, and on a positive side, the existence of more communication 
paths between processors, it is un- avoidable that "suboptimal" paths will be returned. Hence, when measuring 
the data transmission be- havior of the relevant routing algorithms, or more generally, that of the involved 
network structure, people often use such "worst-case" measurement of diameter, defined as the maximum 
distance be- tween any pair of processors in the network [8, 7]. For example, it is well known that the 
diameters of a Ring, a 2-dimensionM wraparound Mesh, and a Hypercube network, all with n processors, 
are O(~), O(~/~), and O(logn), respectively, [8, 9]. Neither the shortest path nor the longest one tells 
the whole story. Inspired by some of the more sophisticated measuring results, such as the average time 
complexities, in the area of algorithm analy- sis [13], we suggested to use average distance be-tween 
any two arbitrary but fixed processors in the network as another, and a more global, mea-surement of 
the data transfer capability of network structures [14, 15]. In terms of graph theory, a general strategy 
to derive the average distance between two nodes in a network is to apply combinatorial and other tech- 
niques to count the total number of simple paths between those two nodes in the associated graph, calculate 
the sum of their lengths, and then divide the latter by the former. 89 The average distance in tra- 
between (1, 1) and (re, n) in this augmented mesh structure, referred to as Ms(m, n) throughout this 
ditional mesh paper. In a traditional m x n mesh structure, m, n > 1, each processor, except those in 
the boundary rows and columns, is connected to four other proces-sors, those immediately to its left 
and right, and those below and above. The boundary processors, 2(m + n -2) in total, are connected to 
only two processors, depending on their specific locations. Without loss of generality, let's denote 
an arbitrary but fixed processor by its coordinate in the associ- atedmxngrid, (i,j),l<i<m,l<j<_n. To 
efficiently send a packet to its destination, it is natural to require that such routing actively reduce 
the distance between the current location of the packet and its destination. Thus, e.g., when one tries 
to send a packet from the top-left corner to the bottom-right one, an effective routing algo- rithm only 
uses links that either lead to the east, or the south, of the current processor. We call such paths "effective 
paths", which, in this case, actually constitute the shortest ones. Since the length of every path, including 
the longest one, from (1,1) to (re, n) in a traditional structure is re+n-2, it is immediate that both 
the diameter of, as well as the average distance between (1, 1) and (re, n) in, such a structure is m 
+ n- 2. 3 The average distance in an augmented mesh structure One of the drawbacks of the traditional 
mesh struc- tures is that its diameter is relatively large. Indeed, as we have seen, for a traditional 
m ร n mesh, its diameter is m + n -2, a linear flmction of its size. This is significantly larger than 
that of other of- ten used networks, e.g., hypercube and its many cousins, whose diameter is almost always 
only log- arithm of its size. One way to solve this problem is to introduce various types of bus systems 
[2, 6]. Re- cently, it was also suggested 1 in literature [3] that, in a mesh structure, "communication 
may be aug- mented by providing additional diagonal links .... " This change will actually cut the diameter 
by about half. In this section, we study the average distance lIn fact, as pointed out in [9], this idea 
was discussed in [10] and later implemented in the MasPar MP1 and MP2 machines. 90 Let NMs(m,, n) denote 
the total number of effec- tive paths between (1, 1) and (m, n), and let PM8(m, n) denote the sum off 
the length off those paths. To de- rive the recurrence relations, we notice that, since any effective 
path from (1, 1) to (rn, n) will either go east via the edge ((1, 1), (1, 2)), then followed by an effective 
path from (1, 2) to (m, n), or go south via the edge ((1, 1), (2, 1)), then followed by an ef- fective 
path from (2, 1) to (re, n), or go southeast via the edge ((1, 1), (2, 2)), then followed by an ef- fective 
path from (2, 2) to (m, n). Hence, O, m=Oorn=O; 1, m>l&#38;n=l, NMs(m,n) = or n > l~'m = 1; gMs(m --1,n) 
+ NMs(m.,n --I) +NMs ('m 1, n -1), otherwise. When either m = 1 or n = 1, it is trivial to define PMs(m, 
n). When m, n > 2, let's consider the case that the first edge goes east to (1, 2). Clearly, the total 
length of all the effective paths from (1, 2) to (re, n) is just PMs(m,n --1). With respect to the contribution 
of the first edge, we observe that for every effective path from (1,2) to (re, n), the first edge, ((1, 
1), (1,2)), contributes a 1. Hence, this part contributes NMs(m,n-1) to the total. The analysis of the 
other two scenarios are similar. Hence, 0, m=0orn=0; m-l, m>l&#38;n=l; n-l, n> l~m=l;  PMg(m,n) = PMs(m 
--1, n) + PMs(m,n-1) +PMs (m --1, n -I)+ Np(m, n), otherwise. By applying the generating function technique 
and other combinatorial techniques, we have also obtained the following results in [14], again with respect 
to effective paths, for Ms(m, n) : for m, n >_ 2, m -- 1 m + n -k - 2 NMs (m,n) k m-1 ' and ~--2 k~O 
 Those two expressions are complicated, and diffi- cult to be further simplified 2. Applying Maple to 
the right-hand side of the first of those two equa- tions, we obtain the following: NMs = (re+n--2) _ 
(m--In) ( m-2F2(m'n)'m-1 ) where Fl(m, n) and F2(m, n) denote F(-m+l, -n+ 1; -m-n+2]- 1) and F(1, 1, 
-re+n+ 1; n+l, -m+ 21 -1), respectively. Both of F1 and F2 are exam- ples of hypergeometric series, and 
will be discussed in the next section. Since, for any natural numbers, m, n, such that 'rn.< n, = O, 
we have that n NMs = ( m + n -1-- 2 ) Fl (~'' Similarly, assuming that m > n _> 2, we can also have 
the following result: PMs('m'n) = ( rn + n-- 2 ) where F(m,n) = (m + n- 2)Fl(m,n) -(r~)+l~)n(%1)F2(m,n 
) . Let AvgMs(m,n) denote the average distance between (1, 1) and m, n), we have the following: Theorem 
3.1 Let Ms(re, n) be a mesh of m x n nodes. 1. For all m > n > 2, AvgMs(rn, n) = re+n--2  (m- 1)(n- 
1) F](m,n) "rn + n- 2 lZ"2 ('m,,n ) 2. For all n > m > 2, AVgMs(m,n) = AVgMs(n,m). 2By observing Table 
169 in [5, pp. 169], it seems that an additional factor of (-1) k is needed to make both quantities expressible 
in a single binomial coefficient.  4 Unexpresiveness in closed forms The results given at the end of 
the previous section would be final, if we can express both F1 (m, n) and F2(m,n) in "closed-form expressions", 
from both computational and anesthetic consideration. Gra-ham et al [5] provides a "rough definition" 
for the notion of closed-form expression as follows: An expression for a quantity f(n) is in closed form 
if we can compute it using at most a fixed number of "well known" standard operations, independent of 
n. This definition clearly defines the notion of express-ing a quantity in closed forms in terms of 
a class of standard operations. If we only consider such basic operations as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and exponentiation, to be the standard ones, many useful quantities, including the factorial 
function, would not have closed forms. Hence, Gra- ham et al [5] further suggested to extend the collec- 
tion of the "standard operations" to include those important and frequently used quantities, such as 
the factorial function, that are otherwise not ex-pressible in closed forms. As a result, we can now 
regard many new problems to be solvable in closed forms. However, in this section, we will prove, following 
Gosper's approach [4, 5, 12], that neither F1 (m, n) nor F2(m,n) can be expressed in closed forms, in 
terms of quite general a class of hypergeometric terms [12, ยง4.4]. Definition 4.1 A function F(n, k) 
is defined to be a proper hypergeometric term if it can be repre- sented in the following form: m I 
F(n,k) P(n," I-l <(a n + + c,). 1-[i=l(u n + vik + where m, n > O, P(n, k) is a polynomial, and for 
all i, hi, bi, ci, ui, vi, and wi are all constant integers. Let tk be a hypergeometric term, and let 
n--1 = k=ko Gosper's procedure [12, 5] to decide if S(n) can be expressed in a closed form in terms 
of hypergeo- metric terms, i.e., as a linear combination of such terms, can be paraphrased as follows: 
91 1. Calculate r(k) = tk+l/tk; 2. Represent r(k) as b(k) c(k) , such that gcd(a(k), b(k + h)) = 1, for 
all h >_ 0.  3. Whether S(n) has a closed-form solution is then decided as follows:  (a) If the equation 
a(k)z(k+l)-b(k-1)z(k) = 0 has a polynomial solution for x(k), letting z(n) -- b(n-1)x(n) c(~) tr. then 
z(n) -z(ko) is a closed-form solu- tion of S(n). (b) Otherwise, S(n) doesn't have a closed-form expression 
with respect to hyper- geometric terms. Now, we apply this procedure to our Fl(m, n) to show that, although 
the latter is indeed an in-definite sum of hypergeometric terms, it can't be expressed in a closed form 
with respect to hyper- geometric terms. Notice that we have a restriction here that 'm > n > 2. We first 
have to convert F1 (m, n) to the follow- ing more manageable format, via the definition of hypergeometric 
series [5, ยง 5.5-5.7]. (m-I) (n-i) ~-1 k k F1 (m, n) = E k=0 ( m+n-2k ) Hence, ~(k) = -(k -(m -l))(k 
-(n -1))  (k + 1)(k (~ + ~ 2)) Further analysis shows that we can express r(k) as a(k) ~(k+l) b(k) c(k) 
, as required by the Gosper's procedure, where a(k) = k -(m-1), b(k) = -(k + 1), and ~(k) = (k -n).--(k 
-n --m + 2) = (k -~)m.1. The key step in the Gosper procedure is to look for a polynomial x(k) that has 
to satisfy the follow- ing equation: a(k)x(k + 1) -b(k -1)x(k) = c(k). (1) 92 Although both a(k) and 
b(k) have the same degree of 1, the leading coefficients of them differ. Thus, the highest degree of 
the polynomial on the left-hand side won't cancel. Hence, we have that deg(x(k)) = deg(c(k)) -max{deg(a(k)),deg(b(k))} 
= (m-1)-l=m-2. Thus, for some a0, .-,am-2, we have that m--2 x(k) = E aiki" k=0 To find out all the a~'s, 
we plug in a(k), b(k), and c(k) into Eq. 1 to derive the following: m--2 {[k -(m -1)](k + 1)' + k '} 
~ i=0 = (k-n)..-(k-m-n+ 2). (2) Let [ki]f(k) denote the coefficient of k i in f(k), routine analysis 
shows that ~qg.-- 2 [kยฐ]ยฃ~S = (1 -,~,)~,. /=0 For all u E [1, rn -2], [k~]LUS = 2au-1 + E u -1 i=u  
(m-1) ~ ~ and, [km-1]E'HS = 2a,,-2. We also have that for u E [0, m -1],  [k~]n~s = (--1)m-~-~SP(m -- 
1 -- u;n), where by SP(m -1 - u;n), we mean to sum up all the (m-l) prยฐducts'eachยฐfwhichisfยฐrmedu by 
picking up m -1 -u numbers out of the list n, n + 1,..., n + rn -2. For example, when m = 4, [kl]nns 
= (-1)4-1-1s~(2;n) = (n(n+l)+n(n+2)+(n+l)(n+2)) = 3n 2 + 6n + 2. To let Eq. 2 hold, we must have the 
following: for all 0 < u < m- 1, [k IL S = (3) which we will call the canonical system associated with 
F1 (m, n). For example, when m = 4, we have to solve the following linear equations to derive x(n) : 
"3a0-3a1-3a2 = -n a-3n 2-2n 2a0-2al-5a2 = 3n 2+6n+2 2a1-a2 = -3n-3 2a2 = 1. After applying the well-known 
Gauss-Jordan elim- ination procedure [1] on the above specific system, we end up with the following equation. 
4n 3 - 6n 2 + 8n -3 = 0. However, the above equation is not solvable, since {na,n2,n, 1}, as the standard 
basis [1, ยง4.5, Example 25] of the space pa, is linearly indepen- dent, when n > 1. Thus, the only case 
when k0 + kin + k2n 2 + k3n 3 = 0 holds is that for all i, k~ = 0. The above observation can be generalized 
to prove the following result: Lemma 4.1 For all m,n > 1, the canonical sys- tem for Fl(m, n) is unsolvable. 
Consequently, there is no polynomial solution for x(k) to satisfy Eq. 1. Hence, by [12, Theo- rem 5.6.3], 
we have proved the following result: Theorem 4.1 Fl(m,n) can't be expressed as a lin- ear combination 
of hyperyeometric terms. In exactly the same way, we can also prove the following result: Theorem 4.2 
F2(m,n) can't be expressed as a lin- ear combination of hypergeometric terms, as well. [] Therefore, 
the results as given in Theorem 3.1 are indeed final.  References [1] Anton, H., Elementary Linear Algebra,
