 COMPUTER GRAPHICS IN TELEVISION Panel Introduction Our society is increasingly relying on symbolic and 
imaginal communication to augment written and spoken language (advertising graphics, logos and corporate 
I.D.s, satellite weather maps, international traffic, dashboard symbols, etc.). Nowhere are graphics 
and sophisticated imagery being more widely and innovatively used than in television production. Greater 
availability of computer graphics and a strong trend in television technology towards digital electronics 
makes this an application of high synergy and potential. The purpose of this panel is to bring together 
several top system designers and leading graphic designers in television to exchange points of view about 
this exciting application area. Panelists will show and discuss recent on-air uses of electronic graphics 
and will exchange ideas about what is needed, possible, important, and useful for the future. Chairman: 
Richard Shoup, Aurora Imaging Systems Panelists: Tom Klimek, Computer Creations Larry Evans, Ampex Peter
