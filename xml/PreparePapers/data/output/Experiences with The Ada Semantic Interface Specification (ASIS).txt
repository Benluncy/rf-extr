 Experiences with The Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASiS) Developing A Tooi With A View Steven 
J. Blake James B. Bladen TeleSoft 5959 Cornerstone Court West San Diego, CA 92121 (619) 457-2700 The 
Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) was developed by TeleSoft under contract to the STARS (Software 
Technology for Adaptable Reliable Systems) program. ASIS is an open and published callable interface 
which gives tool developers access to the Ada syntactic and semantic information contained in Ada libraries. 
For detailed information on ASIS refer to Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) , TRI-Ada 91 Conference 
Proceedings, October 1991. ASIS is intended to replace fnt generation solutions to the problem of tool 
support for the resolution of Ada semantics. Without ASIS, sophisticated Ada tools are dependent on invalidated 
syntax analyzers or tight coupling to Ada libraries. Neither approach is portable to multiple compiler 
technologies or easily maintained. ASIS allows Ada tool developers to take advantage of the latest Ada 
compilation technology without becoming dependent on a particular vendor s Ada library and its internal 
representation of data. This will be especially important during the A&#38;9X transition period as compilers 
and Ada libraries change to accommodate new Ada 9X features. Ada tools which are built on ASIS will be 
unaffected by Ada 9X changes to compilers unless the tool developer wishes to take advantage of new Ada 
9X feahms as they m added to ASIS. The experiences summarized below rmdtcd from use of the prototype 
version of TeleSoft s ASIS Toolkit which implements the spedlcation on the TeleSoft Ada compiler and 
Iibrmy. These results give early indication that the Pe-ion to copy without fee all or part of this material

development productivity for Ada tool developers -Increase portability of tightly integrated Ada tools 
between platforms and Ada compilers -Realize Ada semantically dependent functionality not possible with 
conventional syntax analyzers -Build on and reuse existing A&#38; compilation technology as the foun&#38;tion 
for next generation Ada tools and environments TeleSoft s ASIS Toolkit has since been fully implemented 
and a product version is currently available on a variety of platforms I Overvleyf ASIS provides a uniform, 
consistent interface to static semantic information stored in an Ada Library. For each Ada compiler vendor, 
ASIS clients are shielded from the evolving proprietary details that implement the library representations 
and internal forms. Through ASIS, clients can query the Ada Library for its compilation units and their 
attributes. Semantic relationships and dependencies between compilation units can be analyzed. Some client 
tools may only be intermted in an external or white box view of compilation units. A compilation unit 
s text fde name (if there is one), the time is was compiled, and its related supporting units, if any, 
are all examples of such external information. Other tools may want to query compilation units for the 
lexical elements that comprise them. This internal or black box view is provided by ASIS through operations 
@1992 ACM 0-89791 -529-1 /92/0011-0458 1.50 that query Ada elements such as declamations, expressions, 
and statements. Some ASIS queries break an element ,such as a package declaration, into its component 
elements, like a list of the declarative items in the package visible part. Other ASIS queries work in 
reverse, semantically resolving a name back to its declaration. ASIS promotes tool portability by providing 
a standardized open architecture. Its loosely-coupled specification provides flexibility across multiple 
vendor implementations. ASIS follows Ada LRM terminology and style to promote consistency and familiarity. 
ASIS has adopted an evolutionary approach, paving the way for future extensions to support Ada 9X. This 
paper describes experiences using ASIS to build an application tool and in applying a simple development 
mwlel used while building ASIS tools on several earlier projects. This model for building ASIS Tool Applications 
uses the following step by step approach 1. Identifying Application Tool Requirements 2. Designing an 
Application View 3. Implementing the Application View 4. Implementing the Application Main Program 
 This model is based on the key concept of an Application View which can be applied regardless of the 
application problem domain. An Application View is a constrained subset of ASIS primary operations along 
with secondary operations that specifically support the tool requirements. The view establishes an understandable 
and manageable interface that supports the functionality needed by the Application TOOL This approach 
can greatly streamline the development process while increasing portability and modifiability of the 
tool. The employment of an Application View has the pleasant si&#38; effect of providing potentially 
reusable ASIS utilities and service components for use in future tools. The remainder of this paper examines 
a problem that was solved with an ASIS Application Tool and describes how the tool was developed using 
this four step approach. Source code examples from the tool are used as illustrations. NI H.umfah of 
the Wklm One of TeleSoft s long term customers at McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) notified Customer 
Support that they required additional functionality in the TeleGen2 Cross-refemur tool to list renamed 
variable objects that are set by updates that refer to the new names. On further investigation it turned 
out that the customer had spent two months developing a tool which parsed the cross-referencer s listing 
file as a means of retrieving information from the TeleGen2 Ada library. They were using this information 
to automatically generate documentation. TeleSoft added the rename set f-to the cross teferencer to 
meet the customer s near term requirement. TeleSoft also pointed out that their approach, although innovative, 
was constrained by the limited amount of Ada library information available through the cross reference 
listing. TeleSoft worked with MDC personnel to define requirements for an ASIS tool to replace the cross­referencer 
in this documentation process. The ASIS tool implemented a simple cross reference utility report generator. 
It is referred to in this paper as the MDC Documentation Tool. The MDC Documentation Tool executes against 
the Ada library for the F-15 Central Computer which contains 200,000 executable Ada statements. MDC now 
intends to develop additional ASIS based tools. The solution was implemented using the four step development 
paradigm described in the Abstract above. The next sections examine each of the steps. t) 1. ldentlf~a 
Aqpllcation T@ Initially, the customer described the desired output of the tool and what it should look 
like. Their goal was direct and simply stated List the names of selected packages that have variables 
set or referenced by other units. Discussion with the customer produced the following liit of definitions 
and requirements. Peflnltlona Direct Supporter Unit A direct supporter unit is one that is mentioned 
in a with clause of another unit. Din?ct Dependent Unit A direct dependent unit is one that mentions 
a direct supporter unit in a with clause. 4.59 sourceUnk If a direct dependent unit sets a variable 
declared in a direct supporter package, then the unit is a source unit of the package. Destination Unit 
Ifa direct dependent unit references a variable declared in a direct supporter package, then the unit 
is a destination unit of the package. The following list identifies the functional requirements of the 
tool as they pertain to ASIS. User interface requirements are not presented in this paper. 1. Initialize 
ASIS and open the Ada Library. 2. Fetch a specific library unit by name from the Ada Library. 3. Fetch 
the list of compilation units in the closure of the library unit, 4. Select only those compilation units 
that are package declarations whose names end with the suffm _pim . 5. For each selected unit, determine 
all compilation units that are direct dependents of that unit. 6. For each of the direct dependent units, 
determine if the unit is a source unit or a destination unih or both 7. Write the information to the 
standard output as shown in the sample output report below. The package name is the direct supporter 
unit. The names of Direct Dependent  Units appear under the source and/or destination unit column. See 
sample output below. 8. Finalize ASIS and close the Ada Library. Once the ~uirements were identifkxl 
and agreed to, it was determhed that ASIS could meet each requiremen~ and that the design of the Application 
Tool could begin. 2. Des-an ~ View ASIS is a large interface (387 operations in 11 packages) and is designed 
to support a wide range of tool needs. Most applications focus on a set of requirements specific to the 
problem domain. This focus can be modeled nicely by defining an Application View as a layer above ASIS. 
A view can incorporate one or more packages and subprograms serving to encapsulate the operations useful 
to client tools much like an Ada package encapsulates groups of logically related entities. The view 
creates a higher level of abstraction. Clients of the view are generally smaller and simpler, making 
fewer calls to accomplish the desired results. A constrained abstract view and its client application 
is easier to understand and maintain. Views can be reusable in whole or in part, providing building block 
components for future use. The view increases the transportability of the client Application Tool by 
hiding vendor specific normalizations that can be the View Si3eclflc~ encountered through ASIS. Even
