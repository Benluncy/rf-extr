Palo Alto Research Center Palo Alto, California Abstract This paper describes a programming system based 
on the metaphor of communicating objects. Experience with arunning system shows that this model provides 
flexibility, modularity and compactness. A compiled representation for the language is presented, along 
with an interpreter suitable for microcoding. The object-oriented model provides naturally efficient 
addressing; a corresponding virtual memory is described which offers dense utilization of residern space. 
lNTRODU(XION The purpose of the Smalltalk project is to support children of all ages in the world of 
information. The challenge is to identify and harness metaphors of sufficient simplicity and power toallow 
a single person to have access to, and creative control over, information which ranges from numbers and 
text through sounds and images. in our experience, the SIMULA notion of class and instance is an outstanding 
metaphor for information structure. To describe processing, we have found the concept of message-sending 
to be correspondingly simple and general. Rather than provide this organization as a feature in an existing 
system, we have taken these two metaphors as the point of departure for the Smalltslk programming language. 
The result is a iively interactive system which provides its own text editing, debugging, file handling 
and graphics display on a personal computer. The Smalltalk language is object oriented rather than function 
oriented, and this often confuses people with previous experience in computer science. For example, to 
evaiuate <some object>+d means to present +4 as a message to the object. The fundamental difference is 
that the object is in control, not +. If <some objeci> is the integer 3, then the result will be the 
integer 7. However, if <some object> were the string Mets , the result might be Meta4 . in this way, 
meaning rides with the objects of the system, and code remains an abstract form, merely directing the 
flow of communication. As we shall see, this separation is a key factor in the ability of a system to 
handle complexity. THE PRINCIPLE OF MODULARITY No part of a complex system should L :pend on the internal 
details of any other part. The design of the Smalltalk language supports this principle through uniform 
reference to objects, sending messages to obtain results, and through organization of object descriptions 
and computational methods into classes. Factoring of information structure and behavior is provided by 
the implementation of subclassing. All references in the Smalltslk language are to objects, which may 
be atomic, or may consist of several named fields which refer in turn to other objects. Though the only 
truly atomic datum is the bit, it is often appropriate for such simple objects as names and numbers to 
be considered atomic. For example, in a piece of code which reads the Y­ coordinate of a point in two 
dimensions, nowhere should there be instructions such as load the second word relative to point p. Such 
an instruction would not perform properly if it encountered a point represented in polar coordinates. 
Communication is the metaphor for processing in the Smalltalk language. Objects are created and manipulated 
by sending messages. The same model describes activities ranging from ordinary arithmetic to communicating 
processes in separate machines. The response to a message is implemented by a method, which reads or 
writes some data field, or sends further messages to achieve the desired response. The communication 
metaphor supports the principle of modularity, since any attempt to examine or alter the state of an 
object is sent as a message to that objec~ and the sender need never know about internal representation. 
For example, points represented in polar coordinates r and theta would have a method which responds to 
the message, y, by returning r*thets COS. The examples in this paper use a syntax which gives higher 
precedence. to messages of fewer argumenta. Therefore theta first receives the message cos (remember, 
cosine is a property of angles, not a function!), and then r receives the message with one argument, 
theta s cosine. Every object in Small talk is created as an instance of some class. The class holds the 
detailed representation of its instances, the messages to which they can respond, and methods for computing 
the appropriate responses. The only information remaining to be stored in an instance is the set of values 
for its named fields. The class is the natural unit of modularity. as it describes all the external messages 
understood by its instances, as well as all the internal details about methods for computing responses 
to messages and representation of data in the instances. In the Smalltalk language, a class can be declared 
to be a subclass of another class, and thus inherit ail the traits of that superclass. The subclass can 
then add traits of its own, can. override those it wishes, and can still invoke the overridden ones from 
within its code. This capability leads to a highly factored system. THE REACTIVE PRINCIPLE The salient 
feature of Smailtalk is that all objects are active, ready to perform in full capacity at any time. Nothing 
of this aliveness should be lost at the interface to the human user of the system. in other words, all 
components of the system must be able to present themselves tci the user in an effective way, and must 
moreover present a set of simple tools for their meaningful alteration. The Smalitalk analogy to a library 
of useful functions is a set of well developed superclasses from which most of the system classes are 
derived. The most general of these, class Object, provides default behavior for printing any object, 
or examining and altering its contents on a display screen. In addition to a keyboard and display screen, 
the Smalltalk system provides a stylus for pointing at the screen. The Smalltalk system includes a class 
Window which establishes a uniform model for interaction with these devices. From Window, users can define 
new subclasses with behavior specific to their content. The inheritance from class Window avoids a lot 
of replicated code and furnishes a uniform model for reactive control over new objects added by the user. 
,R:,m w L: :=. II # c Figure 1. A typical Srnalltalk display Figure 1 shows a typical display screen 
from a Smalltalk system. Each of the rectangular areas is an instance of class Window which provides 
a basic protocol for user interaction: -if the stylus is depressed within the window, the content is 
redisplayed, thus showing it in front of the other windows; -once active, the window becomes the recipient 
of all user actions, such as depressing the stylus, typing on the keyboard, or entering sensitive areas 
around the window -if the stylus is depressed outside the window, control is given up so that another 
window may be awakened. The class Window also provides a basic protocol for handling such actions as 
moving itself, changing its size, printing its contents, and terminating its appearance on the screen. 
The reader may find himself evaluating the user interface presented in the figures, This misses the point, 
which is the aptness of communicating objects in describing the situation. Many other approaches to display 
handling are used with Smalltalk, and they are nol the subject of this paper. - d mmChmlgt s Fiks Fonc5

in the figure belongs to some subclass of Window the subclass handles tie specific content. In figure 
2, for example, the user has awakened a window for editing the text of a class. Specific to this content 
is the ability to select text with the stylus, scroll the text up and down by entering the scroll bar 
at the window s left, and send specific editing messages by entering the menu at its right. The class 
has thus provided a simulation of itself as structured text (which is needed for printing anyway). This 
text in turn furnishes a text editor to display the text and allow it to be manipulated. Finally, the 
window provides a spatial channel for the flow of information in both directions between the user and 
the subject of investigation. As shown in figure 2, the user has just drawn the stylus through the text 
of the message show, and the editor has responded by highlighting the text and noting the selection internally. 
in figure 3, the currently active window supports freehand drawing. It provides a large menu from which 
to choose brush shape and paint tone to be applied when the stylus is depressed. Another window interfaces 
to one of the character fonts, allowing the user to design new fonts at will. Yet another displays the 
time of day. Each of the windows brings its own semantics to the uniform syntax of stylus motion and 
keyboard action available to the investigator. In this way, the underlying metaphor of communicating 
objects can be seen to operate all the way up to the level which corresponds to a conventional operating 
system. .  . : ER(IX -,,.rm,..,.,i,roh,,.. := :,:; ; October I 2, I ?7 xi-cm Ire5t0re %nallcal b ~u,t

v. 5Lroll Em 51UWI Figure 3. Painting a picture EXAMPLE OF A SMALLTALK CLASS: Rectangle As we have seen 
above, most programming in Smalltalk is done using a structured editor. Rather than go into the details 
of this process, we show here an excerpt from class Rectangle, show how it supports the Window example 
above, and describe in detail the operation of one of its messages. A Smalltalk class is defined by giving 
it a name, and naming the fields of its instances. Following this is an optionally categorized list of 
the messages to which the class responds. Each message consists of a pattern followed by Smalltalk code 
within brackets. Class new title: Rectangle ; fields: origin corner . Access to fields origin [ITorigin]

x-pt x x y: y: y+pt y-pt y y 1 The scheduling of windows shown in figures 1-3 is implemented in Window 
s response to the message startup (visible in figure 1). The chief element in the code is the expression 
frame containa: atylua 10C which checks whether the stylus location (a Point) is within the frame (a 
Rectangle) of the current Window. The code for Rectangle contains builds, in the procedural domain, nn 
ttie meaning of ~ for Points. i fre t ]rst test aeterm]nes tnm origin is below and to the left of the 
Point pt. and the second test determines that pt is below and to the left of corner. The reader will 
want to know here that arithmetic messages (+, -, etc.) get sent before keyword messages (the identifiers 
ending in colon). Therefore. after the two ~ testa have been made, the conjunction of the two results 
definea the case that the rectangle contains the Point pt. Smalltalk treats all objects which are not 
false as true. This is effected rather easiIy in class Object by messages of the form and: x [self.falae~[l? 
falae] Tx], whtch are inherited by all other classes. The implication arrow is a primitive operation 
which compiles into a branch conditional on the dlsti nguished object, false. The other messages to 
Rectangle are presented so that interested readers can pursue the message outline W, which causes an 
outline of width w to appear around the rectangle on the screen. This message is used by class Window 
to clear and outline its frame. These readers WIII want to know that if several keyword messages aPPe3r 
at a gi~ en leveL they combine to provide a message with multi ple arguments. For example, class Number 
provides a message El arg [fiPOint new x: self W am] for creating Points simply. This code sends the 
compeund message X:Y to the new Point with the two arguments, self and arg. The Benefits of the Message 
Discipline Adding a new class of data to a programming system is soon followed by the need to print objects 
of that class. In many extensible languages, this can be a difficult task at a time when things should 
be easy. One is faced with having to edit the system print routine which (a) is difficult to understand 
because it is full of details about the rest of the system, (b) was written by someone else and may even 
be in another language, and (c) will blow the system to bits if you make one false move. Fear of this 
often leads to writing a separate print routine with a different name which then must be remembered. 
In our object-oriented system, on the other hand, printing is always effected by sending the message 
printon: s (where s is a character stream) to the object in question. Therefore the only place where 
code is needed is right in the new class description. If the new code. should fail, there is no problem; 
the existing system js unmodified, and can continue to provide support. The code for moving a Rectangle 
(rnovetw) could be more efficient if corner were relative to origin, so that it did not need to be relocated. 
This could be accomplished by changing names from fields: origin corner to fields: origin extent , and 
updating the code from moveto:pt [corner e corner-origin+pt. origin + pt] to mov.to:pt [origin + pt]. 
In a conventional organization, all the code in the system will have to be recompiled because it used 
to count on finding the corner coordinates in the second field. In fact most systems would require rewriting 
because access to the corner (which used to be a simple load or store) becomes a computation: corner 
[lTorigin+extent] corner: [extent+ pt-origin]  The class organization and message discipline ensure 
that if the original message protocol is supported, then all code outside the class will continue to 
work without even recompiling. Moreover, the only changes required will all be within the class whose 
representation is being changed. Modularity is not just an issue of cleanliness. If N parts depend on 
the insides of each other, then .vorne aspect of the system will be proportional to N-squared. Such interdependencies 
will interfere with the system s ability to handle complexity. The phenomenon may manifest itself at 
any level: difficulty of design, language overgrown with features, long time required to make a change 
or difficulty of debugging. Messages enforce an organization which minimizes interdependencies. Another 
benefit of leaving message interpretation up to the target objects is type independence of code. In the 
Rectangle example, the code will work fine if the coordinates are Integer or FloatingPoint, or even some 
newly-defined numerical type. This allows for much sharing of code, and the ability to have one object 
masquerade as another. The Power of Subclasses The utility of type-independent code is exploited by the 
subclass organization in Smailtalk. For example, the superclass Number implements the messages a*maX 
rein: in terms of the basic comparisons, <,., and >. Consequently, after defining only the basic comparisons, 
any new subclass of Number can respond to the full numerical protocol. Other messages in the superclass 
Number, such as ~ (which creates a Point) and toby: (which creates an interval), similarly allow coordinates 
of Points, and limits of for-loop ranges to be FloatingPoint, Fraction, or any other kind of Number. 
The factoring provided by subclassing leads to cleanliness arrd compactness. It can also increase efficiency 
through multiplied use of high-speed system code. For instance, we provide microcode support for reading 
and writing the next item in a Stream. Now by making class DiskFile a subclass of Stream, DiskFile inherits 
this very efficient code for its most common operations. The superclass Stream sends itself the message 
pastend when it reaches the end of its character buffer, and this gives the subclass DiskFile a chance 
to read a new record off the disk by overriding the meaning of pastend. Besides allowing subclasses to 
override messages in their superclasses, Smalltalk provides for access to the overridden messages. In 
figure 2, the selected text defines the message show to DocWi ndow, show [snper show. self showDoc] 
which overrides Window s definition. The token, super, indicates that the following message should be 
looked up beginning with the class above. In this case it allows DocWindow to invoke Window s show code 
to put a frame around the window before telling the document to display its text. Further properties 
of Smalltalk subclassing, including multiple inheritance of traits, are beyond the scope of this paper. 
 IMPLEMENTATION The challenge of implementing the Smalltalk language is to provide acceptable performance 
without compromising the simplicity of the underlying metaphors. Beyond the laudable goals of modularity 
and factoring, four pragmatic issues affect the performance of the Smalltalk system: storage management, 
compact object code, message handling, and a decent virtual memory. Storage Management Requiring the 
programmer to manage the allocation and deallocation of objects is out of the question in a true high-Ievel 
language. It is a sure source of errors and it clutters the code with irrelevant pragmatic. Instead, 
the Smalltalk kernel maintains reference counts for all objects, and frees them to be reused when the 
count goes to zero. We chose reference counting over garbage collection because the computational overhead 
is more uniform in real-time, and the behavior with little free storage is better. The dominant flow 
of data in a programming system is usually small integers, either representing characters or results 
of simple arithmetic and indexing. The Smailtalk system reclaims small integers without reference counting 
(they are special object references); this one wild-card (prment in some LISP systems) reduces the overhead 
to a reasonable level. The reclamation of cyclic structures cannot be handled by reference counting, 
but we have not found this to be a problem. The class architecture makes it especially convenient to 
manage objects which are going to participate in cyclic structures. For each cyclic link field, an appropriate 
unlink message can be defined which propagates through the structure breaking the cycle. it is true that 
this discipline corresponds to explicit storage. management, but it is well localized, and hence presents 
little problem. Compact Object Code Dear to our hearts is the ability to run Smalltalk on personal computers. 
In this arena, compactness of the system is crucial and worth sacrificing some raw speed to achieve. 
Moreover, our experience with virtual memory systems is that overall performance actually improves with 
compactness owing to reduced swapping of the workingset. To this end, the Smalltalk system translates 
source code into compact syllables corresponding to the elements of the language. String I  Class title 
corner origin I part names Mess,--fln;~+;nn-r*/ superclass message diet : : : . .. inst size =2 free

-e argument tempframe .-X=io stack ptr ----y =20 mclass receiver self Point Rectangle x =5 w origin 
y =12 corner Point X=120 y =50 Figure 4 -Smalltalk Structures The top of figure 4 illustrates the static 
structure in Smalltalk-76 corresponding to Rectangle contains. One of the fields of the class points 
to an object called a MessageDictionary. This is a hash table whose keys are the message names (UniqueStrings) 
and whose value parta include the corresponding compiled method and also the source code. The compi Ier 
translates the source code into syllables arranged in postfix order using what the class knows about 
instance fields and other variable locations. Including some setup information discussed below, the code 
body for computing contain= occupies 14 code syllables or, in our system, seven 16-bit words. The choice 
of encoding is made by translating every common item into a single syllable, and then providing escapes 
for cases where this is impossible. The codes fall into the following basic categories 1 Load relative 
to receiver (self) 2 Load relative to temp frame 3 Load relative to Iiterals 4 Load indirect Iiterals 
5 Load relative to context 6 Load constant 7 Send literal message 8 Send special message 9 Short jumps 
10 Long jumps 11 Control ops 12 Escapes The loads pick up an object reference and push it onto an evaluation 
stack, and the message codes either cause a primitive operation or invoke another context, depending 
on the actual message and the receiver on top of the stack. The jumps come in two flavors, unconditional 
and conditional, the latter taking place only if the top of stack is false, but popping the stack in 
any event. The long jumps are followed by an extension syllable. The control ops include returning to 
caller, pop stack, and store, which is followed by a load-like syllable describing the destination field. 
The escapes work like the long jumps, extending the loads and sends by a full syllable of offset. An 
area is set aside in the method for Iiterals (object references which do not fit into a syllable). and 
these serve when necessary as an escape to refer to unusual constants, external references or message 
tokens. Our example (which does not use any literals) would be encoded as origin load receiver.O corner 
load receiver.1 pt load temp.O L send special message.7 and: send special message.12 It do controL3 
 The encoded methods typically occupy one quarter the space of the original source code. In implementations 
with no virtual memory, therefore, it would be important to reconstruct the source from the code syllables. 
Message Handling Execution of the code syllables is relatively simple, and the lower half of figure 4 
illustrates the dynamic environment. When a Rectangle receives the message contain~, an instance of class 
Context is allocated to serve much the function of a conventional call frame. Its sender field points 
to the context of its caller, to which the final value of its computation will be passed with the return 
(T) operator. The self field points to the object who is receiving this messagq in our example it is 
a Rectangle. The mclass fiell in this example is simply the class Rectangle, but in the case of messages 
which are inherited from superclasses, it indicates the class from which the message was inherited (this 
is needed to provide the super access described earlier). Method points to the object code for the method 
being executed, and PC is a syllable offset into it indicatiuz the current progress of execution. Ternpfrztme 
points to a Vector of temporary storage for the computation. Its access is partitioned into three areas: 
arguments passed from its caller, other temporaries required for the computation (none in our example), 
and the stack area used in evaluating the syllables. Stackptr is the offset indicating the current top 
of stack. The Smalltalk system gets a great deal of mileage out of the fact that Contexts are objects 
of full capability, just like all the other parts of the system. For debugging, the Context is in a position 
to reveal the location of the PC, the contents of the stack, the values of temporary variables and the 
current state of the receiver. For analysis purposes, the operation of the interpreter is simulated Smalltalk 
by a loop which sends the message step to the current context repeat: [current + current step]. An outline 
of this simulation appears in an appendix to this paper. Most of the task of interpretation is implicit 
in the syllable descriptions above. The one complex operation worthy of further clarification is how 
a new context gets set up to send a message to a new receiver. Our example of figure 4 will serve us 
again: corner has been put on the stack, and pt above it is the top item in the stack, Znd the next syllable 
pointed to by PC indicates that the message ~ is to be sent. The very first thing that happens (since 
this is a common arithmetic operation) is that pt is checked to see if it is an Integer allowing a fast 
primitive operation; but it is not The more general process then begins of hashing the token ~ into the 
MessageDictionary of pt s class, Point. A match is indeed found, and the resulting code object can be 
installed in the new context along with pt (popped off the stack) in the self field, class Point in the 
mclass field, and the previous context in the sender field. The setup parameters in the beginning of 
the method are computed at compile time, and serve to initialize the new environment. They tell how much 
space is needed for the ternpframe and how many arguments are expected (one here). After the arguments 
have been moved from the previous stack to the beginning of the tempframe, the setup supplies initial 
values of stackptr and PC, and the new context is ready to run. It will eventually terminate by encountering 
a rezurn syllable. Then the value (true or false) on the top of the stack will get pushed back onto the 
sender s stack, and the computation of Rectangle contains will resume where it Ief t off. Efficient Message 
Handling It should be obvious that to carry the message sending metaphor down into integer arithmetic 
will result in a slow system on any non message oriented computer. The implementor must cheat, but not 
get caught. In other words, the user of the system should not perceive any non­uniformity. To achieve 
acceptable performance, it is important that the microcode interpreter not send messages to Contexts. 
It performs all the same steps, but in the fastest way possible. The Smalltalk system achieves its speed 
by the assignment of special code syllables to the most frequently executed operations. For instance, 
the message + is assigned a special code, and the (microcode) interpreter responds to that code by immediately 
checking whether both receiver and argument are of class Integer. If so, it does the addition in­line 
and proceeds immediately without even looking up the symbol plus, let alone creating a new context. if 
the check fails, then controi passes to the normal message sending code, thus insuring the appearance 
of uniformity. Virtual Memory One of the most satisfying aspects of a system built of objects is the 
naturally efficient use of address space. Since a Smal Italk reference can only point to an object as 
a whole, the Small talk system can indicate 2? 16 distinct objects using 16-bit object references. With 
a mean object size of 20 words, the system can address over a million words, and this size is a nice 
match to the size of common personal computer disk drives. In implementing this virtual memory, we decided 
to swap single objects, thus achieving maximum utilization of resident storage at the possible expense 
of slower establishment of workingset. Without a few tricks this scheme could never work. First, a poor 
man s H uffman code associates the class of an object with its object reference, thus avoiding a l-word 
class-pointer overhead on every object. The address space is given to classes for their instances in 
zones of 128 with the same high-order bits. It is therefore possible to index a table with the high order 
bits of any object reference and discover the class of that object. Second, variable length classes have 
many such zones, one for each of the common small lengths. In this way the overhead of a length word 
is avoided on the small sizes. For larger sizes, the zones cover octave Ianges (i.e., 9-16, 17-32, and 
so on) and an extra word specifies the exact length. Third, these zones of address space are mapped into 
contiguous locations on the disk. Since all the objects are instances of the same class, they have the 
same size hence the page and offset on the disk can be computed from the low order bits of the object 
reference. In this way non­resident objects can be located on the disk to be brought into core. For the 
octave sizes, a little wasted space on the disk is traded for the ability to compute the disk offset 
location. Fourth, the zoning provides a solution to the problem of making free space without thrashing 
the disk. Here is the problem: there are 1000 objects in core, roughly 20 words each, and we suddenly 
need 500 words of spac~ if we have to write out 25 objects (assuming we can even decide which ones), 
how do we keep from doing 25 disk seeks to do it? Our solution is to purge core by zone, thus writing 
many objects together on a page, and sweeping over the disk in order of pages. Moreover, a single bit 
on each object meaning I ve been touched since my zone was last purged provides a nice aging criterion 
for selecting objects to be purged. CONCLUSION We have known for some time that the uniform model of 
communicating objects leads to a naturally integrated programming system. A very gratifying aspect to 
our work is the demonstration that this approach can also result in an efficient implementation. The 
Smalltalk system has supported large applications for simulation, information retrieval, text editing, 
musical composition and animation without encountering significant barriers to complexity, and this is 
our strongest indication of the worth of the language. Beyond this I must add that programming in Smalltalk 
is fun. On the one hand, the act of assembling expressions into statements and then into methods is not 
very different from conventional programming. On the other hand, the experience is totally different, 
for the objects which populate and traverse the code are active entities, and writing expressions feels 
like organizing trained animals rather than pushing boxes around. Acknowledgement Many people have contributed

they are instances of a perfectly normal Smalltalk class. In this way, the frdl generality of .%nalltalk 
can be applied to examining and tracing the progress of SmaUtalk execution. The code below differs from 
the actual code in Smalltalk-76 in that it corresponds to the slightly simplified categories of the text, 
and has not been carefully checked for off-by-1 errors. Beyond the specifics in the text, the interested 
reader will want to know: - is the subscript message: as in: tempf rame lobits -except for assignment, 
+ w treated as an agglutinating message pa~t, as in: t. i + self pop -the + symbol indicates conditional 
execution; if the preceding value is true, then the following body of code is executed, and control exits 
the outer (!) brackets. This ,if -On/,yl, form serves tobuild dispatch tables as in the messag~ next 
below -the default value returned from any message is self , the receiver of the message. Other values 
may be returned with the W symbol. The messages inst f ield: n and instf ield: n+ val , which are 
used below to read and write the n-th field of an instance, clearly violate the principle of modularity. 
This reflects that the buck stops here, and these primitive messages appear nowhere else in the system.
