f Claude Puech $ J. M. Robson $ Abstract. Quadtrees constitute a hierarchical data structure which permits 
fast access to multidimensional data. This paper presents the analysis of the expected cost of various 
types of searches in quadtrees fully specified and partial match queries. The data model assumes random 
points with independently drawn coordinate values. The analysis leads to a class of full-history divide 
and conquer recurrences. These recurrences are solved using generating functions, either exactly for 
dimension d = Z, or asymptotically for higher dimensions. The exact solutions involve hypergeometric 
functions. The general asymptotic solutions relie on the classification of singularities of linear differential 
equations with analytic coefficients, and on sin­gularity analysis techniques. These methods are applicable 
to the asymptotic solution of a wide range of linear recurrences, as may occur in particular in the analysis 
of multidimensional searching search tree to multidimensional data. The principle, in problems. the case 
of planar problems, is simply that a point par­ titions the search space into four quadrants (see Fig. 
1). When used recursively, this principle leads to a decom­ 1 Introduction position of the underlying

log n (for d = 3). Our asymptotic complexity results are valid for every dimension d ~ 2. They are expressed 
in terms of the number of nodes traversed in a search, more complex measures being amenable to similar 
analysis techniques. A fully specified search is found to have average cost C ~d) -~ log n. (1) (These 
results are thus in good agreement with the empirical estimates mentioned above.) If we compare the cost 
of a search in a common ( l dimensional) bi­nary search tree [14] which is z 2 log n, we thus wit­ness 
a contraction factor of I/d for the depth of d dimensional quadtrees. This represents a sort of global 
conservation of the search costs (each node in a quadtree contains d fields), a phenomenon independently 
estab­lished by Devroye [6] using the theory of branching pro cesses. Precise estimates with quantitative 
error terms appear in Theorems 1 and 4. One of the main uses of quadtrees is for partial match queries. 
In that case, only s out of d coordinates, with 1 ~ s < d, are specified in a search. First, one may 
consider a simplified model based on the assumption that the quadtree is a perfect tree. (See [4] and 
[2, p. 513] for a similar model of k d trees.) This leads for the cost Q$ d) in the perfect tree model 
to gonsider the recurrence Q$d) = ~ + ~d-s .,(f) Q:12. > (2) since a search in a tree of size n first 
visits &#38;he root and then continues to explore 2d s trees each of size about n/2d by the assumption 
of a perfect tree. The solution of Eq. (2) is Q$,4 = ~(nl-dd) (3) Otherwise said, a perfect quadtree 
resembles a perfect grid with meshes of size n-lid. It turns out that the model (2) provides an undully 
optimistic estimate for random data. The exact form (s,d) is of the recurrence for the average search 
cost Qn given in Section 2 below. The corrected form of (3) is then found to be Q$,dl = @(nl-$/d+$($/dl), 
(4) where the correction function L9(z) in the exponent is given in the statement of Theorem 5. For instance, 
when d = 2, a partial match query with one component specified out of two has expected cost Q. = 0(n(fi-31/2)

This situation resembles the case of k­d trees which has been treated earlier by Flajolet and Puech [9], 
though the multiplicative constants are nat­urally different. The analysis problems that we discuss here 
start with what may be called stochastic divide and conquer recurrences. These recurrences on average 
costs are direct reflections of the recursive search procedures. A typical instance is the recurrence 
corresponding to a fully specified search into a standard quadtree, n-1 (5)f. = 1+ ~<.jkfk, kzo where 
the (n,k are related to splitting probabilities (see below): The natural approach to recurrences of the 
form (5) is of course to introduce generating functions. We thus $wkf(z) := ~ f.% , A recurrence of the 
form (5), with the ~n,~ that involve harmonic numbers, then translates into a linear integral equation 
itself equivalent to a linear differential equation of order 2. More generally, problems in dimension 
d lead to differential equations of order d. The analysis of quadtrees then follows two different routes. 
In dimension d = 2, the differential equations that we encounter have explicit solutions which, for partial 
match, involve hypergeometric functions. In this way, explicit forms involving harmonic numbers or binomial 
coefficients-are available for the complexity analysis of standard quadtrees. Asymptotic forms then follow 
by elementary asymptotic analysis. In dimension d z 3, we no longer find explicit forms of generating 
functions that would be expressible in terms of known special functions. We then follow a route inspired 
by the corresponding analysis of k d trees in [9]. The principles on which the analysis is based are: 
(i) The nature and location of singularities of a func­tion determine the growth of its coefficients 
(see e.g., [8]). (ii) Singularities of the solution to a linear differential equation   i+(o;f(%) 
=.(.), j=O arise from singularities of the coefficients ~j (z) and the zeros of ~d(~) in a well quantified 
way. The k-d trees lead to differential systems while quadtrees introduce more naturally integro differential 
equations. However, in both cases, the analysis of gen­erating functions singularities via differential 
systems constitutes a fairly general methodology which may be used in order to analyze linear recurrences 
with coef­ficients that involve multiple summations and rational functions of indices. Coming back to 
quadtrees, we thus establish here that, not too surprisingly, their expected performances are, as far 
as orders of growths are concerned, rather close to those of k d trees. We may also mention that analyses 
of quadtrees under different usage, like for representing images or as an access method for databases, 
have been given by Yahia et al. [18,25,15] and R.6gnier [19]. 2 Basic Probabilities and Re­currences 
The average case complexity of divide and conquer algorithms is normally expressed by recurrences. For

related recurrence [14, Eq. 6.2.2 4, p. 427] provides the average search cost in a binary search tree 
of size n. Digital searching leads to recurrences of a different shape, see for instance [14, Eq. 6.3-17, 
p. 499]. The general scheme which covers the examples above as well as the quadtree costs is n 1 (7) 
f. = an + ~&#38;,kfk. k=O There fn is the unknown sequence of costs which is to be determined, an is 
a known (and usually simple) number sequence, and the ~~,k are of various forms that reflect in each 
case the probabilities that a problem of size n decomposes into similar subproblems of size k. The form 
(7) is more complex than the standard divide and conquer recurrences of which Eq. (2) is a particular 
example, and we may call it a stochastic divide and conquer recurrence. In this section, we establish 
the form of recurrences satisfied by the search costs in a standard quadtree of dimension d = 2. Let 
U = [0, 1]2 denote the unit square. The probabilistic model of usel assumes that n elements are drawn 
uniformly and independently from U. Proposition 1 Let Pnl,mz,nJ,n4 be the probability that the four root 
subtrees of a quadiree built on n = 1 + 1This model is of course equivalent to assuming simply independent 
drawings from any continuous distribution. nl + nz + n3 + n4 wcords have sizes nl, nz, nz, na. Then: 
pn1,n2,nS,n4 = 1 (nl + nz)!(n~ + na)!(n~ + n~)!(nz + na)! n-n! nl!nx!na!na! PROOF. Let (71, Tz, . . 
. , rn ) be a random element of U , and set rj = ( (zj, ~j). The sought probability is: Pnl,n2,n3,n4 
= 11 n 1 x [(uv)~ ((1 -u)v)~z ) 1! nl,nz,ns,na (8) (u(l v))n~((; u)(1 v))~4] dudv. There du dv is 
the probability that u ~ xl < u + du and v ~ yl < v + dv. The integral gives the probability that the 
nl elements, rz, . . . , r~l+l, are in the first subtree, that the next nz elements rnl+z, . . . . rnl+n~+l 
are in the second subtree etc. Finally, the multinominal coefficient represents the number of possible 
shuffling of the n lelementsrz, ..., rn into four groups of cardinalities nl,nz,na,n4. From the classical 
Eulerian Beta integral, see [1, Chap. 6] or [23, Chap. XII], applied to Eq. (8), (9) we get the stated 
form of the splitting probabilities. Similar arguments provide recurrences relative to path length and 
the cost of partial match queries. Lemma 2 The expected value of internal path length P. in a random 
quadtree of size n satisfies the recur­re n ce n 1 PO =0; P. =n+~~[Hn H~]P~. k=O Lemma 3 Let Qn be the 
expected value of the costs of a partial match query in a random quadtree of size n. Then Qn satisfies 
the recurrence 3 Standard Quadtrees in Di­mension d = 2 In this section, we carry out the analysis of 
search costs in standard quadtrees where the dimension is d == 2. Recurrences translate into integro 
differential equations. For d = 2, the generating functions can be found explicitly. This leads both 
to exact and to asymptotic forms for the costs of fully specified searches and partial mat ch queries. 
In this and the next section, we use a few tools from the theory of linear differential equations for 
which we refer to books by Henrici [12] or Wasow [22]. A treatment of hypergeometric functions that suffices 
for our purposes is to be found in [1,23]. Proposition 4 Let P(z) = ~n>o Pnzn and Q(,z) = be the generating 
fun~tions of Pn and Q.. Z~20Qn~n Then P(z) satisfies the second order equation, P(0) = O, The function 
Q(z) satisfies the differential equation together with the initial conditions; Q(0) = O, Q (0) = 1. 
 PROOF. It follows by a direct translation from recur­rences to generating functions. Theorem 1 The 
ezpected cost of a positive search in a quadtree of size n >1 is cn=+=(l+&#38;##. (12) The expected 
cost of a negative search in a quadtree ofsize n~ 1is (13) 6 3(n+l)  c;=l%+~+ 1 PROOF. The formula 
for Pn was initially found by trial­and error from exact rational forms of Pn for small n. (The occurrence 
of the harmonic number is not too unexpected!) Once it has been conjectured, it is a simple matter to 
verify that the generating function of the Pn as given by Eq. (12), namely 1 22+1 P(z) = -log 3 (1 .2)2 
l: Z++;;T; (14) satisfies the second order integral equation (10), Corollary 5 Asymptotically, a random 
search, either successful or unsuccessful, in a quadiree of size n has average cost log n + O(l), the 
cost being measured by the number of node traversals. Theorem 2 The expected cost Q. of a partial match 
query in a quadtree of size n ~ 1 satisjies 1 + Qn = where Q is the root located between 1 and 2 of the 
equation a(~ + 1) = 4; thus a = (fi 1)/2 w 1.561552812808830. PROOF. First, we convert the differential 
equation of Q(z), Eq. (11), to a standard form, z(1 z)2~Q(z) + 2(1 Z) Z+Q(Z) 4Q(z) = &#38; We observe 
that a particular solution to this equa­tion is 1/(1 z), and therefore, by considering y(z) = Q(z) 
1/(1 z), we find that y(z) satisfies the homo­geneous equation z(1 -Z)2~y(Z) + 2(1 -%) ~y(~) -4Y(~) 
= 0. (16) By general theorems, the only possible singularities of a solution to such an equation are 
the singularities of the coefficients, and the zeros of the leading coefficient. Thus, the only possible 
candidates are z = O, z = 1, and z = m. It is known a priori, from the origin of the problem, that the 
function element Q(z) is regular at O and has radius of convergence exactly 1 since its coefficients 
are polynomially bounded. Guided2 by the usual principles of singularity analy­sis, one should determine 
the local behaviour of Q(z), or equivalently y(z), around z = 1 in order to derive the asymptotic form 
of the Qn. To that purpose, we first try to substitute an asymptotic form y(z) -C/(1 z) inside Eq. (16). 
The main terms on the left hand side of Eq. (16) are normally of order (1 %) a, safe for certain exceptional 
values of a, where cancellation OC­curs through the coefficients; we expect precisely these cancellation 
cases to provide solutions to the differential homogeneous equation. (The left hand side of Eq. ( 16) 
must be identically O.) Proceeding in this way suggests that y(z) w C/(1 Z)a with a a root of a(a+ 1) 
=4. To make this precise, we set Y(z) (17) z (z)= (1-z)~ See also below the paragraph on singularity 
analysis and in the next section the paragraph on singular differential systems. FLAJOLET ET AL. with 
a still kept as an indeterminate at the moment. The function Y(z) satisfies a transformed equation, namely 
.Z(,Z 1) :Y(2) 2az(z 1)$Y(2) (18) +(zaz + Za 4)Y(Z) = o. From the preceding discussion, we now fix 
a to be a root of a(a + 1) = 4, and we select the largest root, namely a = (~ 1)/2, since it is the 
candidate for providing the dominant growth of y(z). In so doing, a term of (z 1) factors out and Y(z) 
is found to satisfy d2 Z(z 1)= Y(z) 2@%:Y(z) + 4Y(Z) = o. (19) The equation (19) clearly has three 
(s~called regular ) singular points at O, 1, and co and we may compare it with the standard hypergeometric 
equation. The hypergeometric equation [23, p. 283] involves three parameters, a, b, c. It reads z(l 
z)~F (z) + [c (a + b + l)z]$~(z) (20) abF(z) = O. A formal solution of it defines the classical hypergeornet­ 
ric function, F[a, b; c; Z1 = a.bz a(a + 1) .b(b + 1) .Z2 1+ --~+ ~+ .. (21) C(c+ 1) . Clearly special 
cases arise when parameters assume special values, e.g., if c is a negative integer. It is now an easy 
task to match the hypergeometric equation (20) with the equation (19) satisfied by Y(z). We find the 
correspondence a= ~, b= (a+ l), c=O. (22) The fact that c = () is an indication that we are in one of 
the special cases of the hypergeometric equation. It is known (see Article 15.5.20, page 564 of [1]) 
that one of the solutions is then ~(a + 1, b + 1, 2, z), and another independent solution has a logarithmic 
singularity at O. (The series solution can also be verified directly by the method of indeterminate coefficients.) 
Since y(z) and Q(z) are by construction regular at O, logarithmic solutions should be discarded. The 
coefficient of the solution that is analytic at the origin is easily found to be equal to 1, because 
of initial conditions. Thus, from the correspondence of Eq. (22), unwinding our earlier changes of variables, 
we find the main equation we have the implication: F[ a, 1 a;2; z] 1 f(z) = Q(z) = (23) (l-z)a l z

These two expansions permit us to determine an explicit whenever %(c a b) > 0, and c # 0, 1, 2, ... (see 
convolution form of the coefficients of Q(z), aa obtained [23, 14.11] or Article 15.1.20 of [1]). Thus, 
we find from in (23). The statement of the theorem follows. Eq. (23) that From the generating function 
form (23) of Q(z), de­(28) tailed asymptotic information on the coefficients Q. is available. By the 
general principles of sz ngzdan ty anal­ with ysis techniques [8] that we review now, the asymptotic 
r(2a + 1) Y* = F[ @, 1 ~;2; 11= form of Q. is determined by the asymptotic properties r(2 + ~)r(l +a) 
of Q(z) at its singularity z = 1. That asymptotic expansion is easily found to hold true in an extended 
domain of the complex plane since the hypergeometric function only has algebraic or Singularity analysis. 
That method is based on two logarithmic branch points. Thus, by singularity analysis principles. First, 
if we examine coefficients of standard [8], we are able to transfer the asymptotic relation functions 
that are singular at z = 1, we observe that on Q(z) into a corresponding asymptotic form of Q., functions 
that get larger around z = 1 have larger namely coefficients. Let [zn]~(z) denote the coefficient of 
.zn in ~(z). Approximating the binomial coefficients, we find The statement of the theorem thus follows

purely divergent formal 3F2 hypergeometric forms. The quality of the approximation that we obtain by 
retaining the first four terms of the expansion (29) these terms all come from ~(cx, n) is already quite 
exceptional; for n = 1, 10, 100, 1000, the absolute error is of order respectively 10-2, 10-6, 10-9, 
10 12. The error is tiny, even for n = 1, and even though the series is divergent ! 4 Higher Dimensions 
In this section we examine the cost of various searches in quadtrees for data taken in higher dimensional 
spaces. The recurrences involve more complicated split­ting probabilities and the generating function 
equations have integral forms that reduce to linear differential equations of order d, when the dimension 
is equal to d. The results are less explicit than in the case d = 2, but orders of growth can still be 
precisely quantified al­though, in the case of partial match, the multiplicative constants do not appear 
to have closed forms (to the best of our knowledge!). We use in an essential manner singularity analysis 
techniques. We are thus led to analyzing generating functions locally around their dominant singularity 
at z= 1. The case of a fully specified search illustrates a situ­ation in which the dominant asymptotic 
behaviour at z = 1 comes from the inhomogeneous term in the differential equation. The case of a partial 
match query corresponds to a situation where the dominant asymptotic contribution comes from solutions 
to the associated homogeneous equation. In both cases, we use a modest amount of the theory of singular 
points of linear differential equations as may be found in books by Henrici [12] or Wasow [22]. FLAJOLET 
ET AL. Singular differential systems. By a classical thec­rem, the singularities of a homogeneous linear 
differen­tial equation or system can only arise from singularities of the coefficients. For systems, 
a particularly important case occurs when the coefficient matrix is mesomorphic and the singularity under 
consideration is only a simple pole. The singularity is then called reguiar. If the sin­gularity is normalized 
to occur at z = 1, a fundament al result implies that there exist solutions of the form By substituting 
inside the original equations, we need to obtain complete cancellation. It is then seen that only a finite 
number of possibilities exist for a; these are solu­tions of a polynomial equation which is known as 
the in­dicial equation. The process could be called a method of indeterminate exponents ; complete expansions 
then follow by the usual technique of indeterminate coeffi­ cients. Lemma 7 Let Pn denote the expected 
internal path length in a d-dimensional quadtree of size n. The Pn satisfy the recurrence n 1 where the

C~d) = ( log n ~ log n + Ad + o ~ + n2c0st2 /d)-2 log n , (32) ) for some rea{ constant Ad. PROOF. The 
main idea of the proof is that the equa­tion (31) behaves as a perturbation of a simpler equa­tion that 
can be solved explicitly. This fact relies on the observation that the two functional If(z) and Jf(z) 
act as singularity transformers (around the singular­ity z = 1) in the same way, as far aa main orders 
of growth are concerned. The proof proceeds in three steps. A. Consider the simplified homogeneous equation 
in which J is replaced by I, y(Z) 2dIdy(z) = O. (33) This is an Euler equation that has exact solutions 
of the form (j= O,.. .,1)l) yj(z) = (1 *)-2~ with u = e irld. (34) B. The inhomogeneous equation associated 
with (33) and (31) is (35) g(z) 2dIddz) = (l :2)2. Put differently, the function g(z) is a component 
of a vectorial system, &#38; &#38;Ag + W, (36) in which the matrix A involved in the singular part 
is a circular permutation matn x. The inhomogeneous sys­tem is then solved by the matrix form of the 
variation of constant method [12, p. 99], since all solutions to the homogeneous equation are known. 
In this way, we find that the solution to (35) satisfies 1 @0=:(1:*2@­l z (37) 2 +(l-z) +~$l! z) ) The 
logarithm occurs because of resonances between some homogeneous solutions and the inhomogeneous term. 
Notice carefully that we are also able to deter­mine ultimately the leading coefficient 2/d because the 
treatment of (36) can be made explicit. C. Let g(z) be the solution to the approximate in­homogeneous 
equation (35). We return to the equation j(z) -2ffJd- If(%) = &#38; (38) satisfied by P(z). The induced 
equation for h(z) = ~(z) g(z) is such that its homogeneous part resembles that of the original equation 
while we attain a reduction in order of growth for the inhomogeneous term. In this way, we are able to 
prove that h(z) = o((1 z)-- ). Thus QUAD TREES 107 the dominant asymptotic growth is dictated by g(z), 
and the singular expansion of P(z) has been completed. From there, the behaviour of P., hence that of 
 C$d) = Pn/n, follows by singularity analysis. Lemma 8 Let Qn represent the expected number of node traversals 
in a partial match query of a random d dimensional quadtree containing n points. Then QO = O and, for
