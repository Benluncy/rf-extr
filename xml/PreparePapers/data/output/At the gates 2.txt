 ANNA M. CHUPA Brain Cell, At the Gates 2, Descanso, and Assumption are images dedicated to Esu and 
Gede. Esu is the guardian of the gates. As such, he plays an important role in all significant moments 
in life when an individual or community is at a crossroads, and important decisions need to be made or 
actions taken. Esu is also the Loa (spirit) of commu­nication between human and divine forces. Finally, 
Esu is a trickster and a patron saint of rebel heroes who disrupt the status quo in order to bring about 
a greater and fuller social harmony. He is often represented as a mischievous child who likes things 
he can t have (cigars, cigarettes, rum, matches) as well as toys and candy. Keys for Esu refer to his 
associ­ation with St. Peter. Conical figures with a cowrie shell face are found in altars from Benin 
to Brazil, Trinidad, and the United States. Esu s associ­ation with systems and networks is iterated 
in RJ45 connectors and similar items left on contemporary altars. Anna Chupa received her Master of 
Fine Arts degree at the University of Delaware and a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies at Dartmouth College. 
Her primary artistic disciplines prior to working in digital media were painting, textiles, printmaking, 
and performance art. She has published a book and several essays on Jungian archetypes in African-American 
fiction. Her digital photography and mixed media installations have been exhibited at SIGGRAPH, the Digital 
Salon, and the Silicon Gallery in Philadelphia. SPONSORS Cone Editions Press Priestess Miriam Chamani
