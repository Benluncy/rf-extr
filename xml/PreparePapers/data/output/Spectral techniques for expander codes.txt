 Spectral Techniques for Expander Codes John D. Lafferty* Abstract This paper introduces methods based 
on generalized Fourier analysis jor working with a class of error­correcting codes constructed in terms 
of Cayleygmphs. t%r work is motivated by the recent results of Sipser and Spielman [15] showing graph 
expansion to be essential for eficient decoding of certain low-density parity-check codes. They leave 
open the problem of sub-quadratic encoding for this class of codes, and it is this prob­lem that we address. 
We show that when the codes are constructed in terms of Cayley graphs, the sym­metry of the gmphs can 
be ezploited by using the rep­resentation theory of the underlying group to devise a sub-quadmtic encoding 
algorithm that, in the case where the group is PSLz(Z/qZ), requires 0(n4/3) operations, where n = 0(q3) 
is the block length. Our results indi­cate that this new class of codes may combine many of the strengths 
of two of the most powerful and successful, but previously dispamte areas of coding theory: the class 
of cyclic codes where the rich algebmic structure yields a large collection of techniques for finding 
and manip­ulating the codes, and the class of low-density parity­check codes which have simple and eficient 
decoding al­gorithms and good asymptotic properties. Introduction This paper is concerned with a class 
of codes that can be viewed as generalized cyclic codes, in the sense that the code is defined to be 
invariant under a group of translations. Our investigations are motivated by the recent work of Sipaer 
and Spielman [15] that revisits the .Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon Univer­sity. Email:

and the recursive codes investigated by Tanner [18], and shows that the expansion properties of the underlying 
graphs are essential for efficient decoding. Using explicit or random constructions of expanders, the 
results of [15] yield asymptotically good families of codes that can be decoded in linear time (in the 
uni­form cost model; see [15]). The results of [16] go further and construct both linear time encodable 
and decodable codes by combining expander codes with encoding cir­cuits based on superconcentrators; 
however the result­ing codes have much weaker error correction properties. While expander codes can be 
efficiently decoded, the only known encoding algorithm for them is the quadratic algorithm available 
for all linear block codes: reduce the parity-check matrix to a systematic form, and encode using matrix 
multiplication. Since these codes are attractive primarily for large block lengths, the quadratic encoding 
cost appears to make them impractical for many applications. The methods of [15], however, use only the 
expansion properties of the explicit constructions. These graphs have additional structure since they 
are Cayley graphs of certain non­abelian groups. We show how the symmetry of these graphs can be exploited 
by using the representation the­ory of the underlying group G to devise an encoding algorithm that requires 
0(n3i2) operations in general, and 0(n4/3) operations when G = PSL2 (Z/qZ), where n = 0( IGI) is the 
block length.1 Further reductions in complexity may be possible with continued improve­ments in algorithms 
for nonabelian FFTs. This encoder is nonsystematic, however we also ex­plain how a systematic encoder 
can be obtained using similar methods, but at the expense of an asymptoti­cally vanishing loss in rate. 
In addition, we show that for G = PSL2 (Z/qZ), the constraints coming from certain representations of 
the group correspond to expander codes of smaller block length in the spectral domain. Using the tools 
of representation theory of finite groups, 1Recall that SL2 (Z/qZ) is the special linear group of 2x2 
matrices of determinant one having entries from the finite field IFq of q elements. The projective special 
linear group PS&#38; (!Z/gZ) is obtained by dividing S&#38; (Z/qZ) by its center, {+1} where Z is the 
2 x 2 identity matrix, and is a simple finite group of Lle type (for q ~ 5). The group PS~(Z/gZ) h= been 
a part of coding theory for quite some time; in fact, it arises-as the automorphism group of certain 
quadratic residue codes [10]. we are able to transform the parity-check conditions into a block-diagonal 
form, with each block corresponding to an irreducible representation. These spect ral expander codes 
emerge after choosing suitable bases for the rep­resentations. The group PSL2 (Z/qZ) is central to our 
work because explicit expander codes can be constructed using the ex­plicit Ramanujan graphs that are 
known for this group, and our previous work [6] indicates that random Cay-Iey graphs for this group are 
good expanders. The use of random Cayley graphs that is, graphs constructed by choosing random generators 
for the group-removes some of the restrictions on block length and subcode size that the explicit codes 
impose. As we showed in [5], the expansion of a Cayley graph can be estimated efficiently by using Fourier 
analysis to calculate its spectrum. The spectral methods that we present here for this new class of low-density 
Cayley codes can be seen as generalized versions of spectral techniques for classical cyclic codes. Our 
results, which make the first signifi­cant use of nonabelian Fourier analysis ih coding, sug­gest that 
expander codes based on groups may combine many of the strengths of cyclic codes, for which the alge­braic 
structure yields a powerful collection of techniques for finding and manipulating the codes, with those 
of the low-density parity-check codes, which are known to have simple and efficient decoding algorithms 
and good asymptotic properties. 2 Background In this section we briefly review spectral techniques for 
classical codes, the essential elements of general­ized Fourier analysis and the constructions of expander 
codes . 2.1 Classical spectral techniques Many of the fundamental algorithms for classical cyclic codes 
have both time domain and frequency domain veraions. These algorithms often have simi­lar complexities, 
but Fourier analysis can sometimes be used to obtain more efficient algorithms, and the intu­ition developed 
in the frequency domain is often quite powerful. An instructive example is the proof of the BCH bound 
using Fourier analysis [3]. It will be useful to recall the basic spectral tech­niques, since our generalized 
methods parallel them. Let ~ : Z/nZ ~ F1 be a function on the cyclic group of order n, taking values 
in the finite field F1 of 1 elements, where n = /m 1 for some m. Fixing a primitive element a of the 
fini~e field F{-, the Foum er transform of f is the function f : 2Z/nZ + IFln defined by n-1 j-(j)= ~ 
cl ~f(i) , i=o and the Fourier inversion formula then takes the form f(i) = ~ ~ cr- ~~(j) . J =0 The 
duality between the frequency domain and time de main pictures is characterized by the convolution theo­rem, 
which shows that convolution in one domain is taken to a product in the other. That is, if n 1 f*g(i) 
= ~ f(j) g(i j) , jGO then ~g(j)=~(j)~(j) j= O,...,l l and similarly, if we define ~(j) by n 1 i(j)= 
~ f(k) j(k j) , k=O then h(i) = f(i)g(i) for i = O, . . .n 1. This fact is the basis for several spectral 
algorithms. In particu­lar, one decoding algorithm for BCH codes computes the syndromes as spectral components, 
and applies the BerlekampMassey algorithm to the natural convolu­tion equation in the frequency domain. 
On the level of groups, this takes advantage of the isomorphism be­tween an abelian group and its dual, 
which is not avail­able for nonabelian groups. Fourier analysis is fundamental to the manipulation and 
study of cyclic codes. Multiplication in the ring IFl[z]/(z 1) can be viewed as convolution of functions 
on Z/nZ, or equivalently, aa multiplication in the group algebra lFlZ/nZ. Thus, if g(z) is the generator 
pol yno­mial of the code, then a data polynomial d(z) is encoded nonsystematically as n-1 c(i)=~ g(k)d(i 
k). k=O Taking Fourier transforms, this is expressed in the fre­quency domain as ?(j) =~(j) i(j), j= 
O,. ..,l l. Since any vector satisfying this expression is a code word, and the spectrum of the data 
is arbitrary, the only constraints are that the spectrum of c must be zero at certain frequencies, provided 
that the inverse Fourier transform is an IF1-valued function. In spectral terms, a t-error correcting 
BCH code is obtained by constraining 2t consecutive frequencies to zero, and a Reed-Solomon code is a 
BCH code for which the block length n is equal to 1 1. The spectral encoding algorithm is particularly 
simple in this case. After setting the specified 2t fre­quencies of the code to zero, the data values 
(elements of IFL) are placed in the remaining n 2t frequencies, and we take an inverse Fourier transform 
to obtain a non­systematic codeword. For more general cyclic codes, conjugacy constraints must be imposed 
to ensure that the codeword lies in ~. These conditions will be gen­eralized in Section 3.1.  2.2 Fourier 
analysis for finite groups In this section we recall the necessary basics from representation theory. 
We will denote the group alge­bra of a finite group G over a field F ss IFG. Recall that this is the 
vector space of formal IF-1inear combinations ~=~~ %z (ac E IF) with the multiplication given by extending 
the group multiplication. There is a natural 1:1 correspondence between IF-valued functions on the group 
and elements of FG. The codes that we will con­sider can be viewed as left ideals in the group algebra. 
Let ~ be a finite extension of the base field IF. A representation q of G over ~ is a map q : G + GL~n 
(~) such that q(zy) = q(z) q(y) for all x, v E G. Given a representation q of G and a function f : G 
+ F, the Fourier tmnsform off at q is the dw x dq matrix The scalar sums ~(qij ) = ~=e~ ~(z) ~ij (z) 
are Fourier transforms off at the matrix coef)kients qij. To simplify things ye assume that we are working 
over an extension field IF of characteristic that does not divide the order of the group. The Fourier 
transforms at a complete set of inequivalent irreducible represen­tations of G then accomplish a change 
of basis in the group algebra from the basis of delta functions to a ba­sis of irre~ucible matrix coefficients, 
which we will de­note aa G. As a consequence, the dimensions of the irreducible representations satisfy 
IGI = &#38;a d;. The inverse map may be presented as the Foun e~ inversion formula Notice that since 
the characteristic of IF does not divide IGI, this formula makes sense. In general the relation between 
(matrix) Fourier transforms and convolution is given by where convolution over G is defined by f* h(z)= 
~ f(s) /l(s-lZ). SGG When G = Z/nZ, this is all recognizable as the usual discrete Fourier transform 
and its inverse, and their re­lation to circular convolution. In this case the Cooley-Tukey FFT and its 
variants give fast algorithms for accomplishing the relevant computations. For arbi­trary G, in many 
cases fast algorithms still exist, and in particular, for the projective special linear group PSL2 (lZ/gZ!), 
recent work shows that we can accom­plish both forward and inverse Fourier transforms in 0(q4) operations 
[12]. We use a standard computational model in which a single multiplication and addition over IF has 
unit cost. 2.3 Expanders and Cayley codes The construction of expander codes in [15] uses the same basic 
approach as [18], and results in a class of codes closely related to Gallager s low-density parity­check 
codes [4]. In order to obtain an easy lower bound on the rate of the code using only simple properties 
of the graph, this construction uses an unbalanced bi­partite graph Fn,c,d that is c-regular on one side 
and d-regular on the other, with c < d, and a subcode &#38; of block length d over a finite field IF. 
(Sipser and Spiel­man use only the binary field, but the constructions and results easily generalize. 
Our results, however, do not depend on generalizations of their analysis of the decod­ing algorithms.) 
The code C(rn,c,d, Sd) is the collection of IF-valued functions on the c-regular vertices such that the 
neighbors of each of the d-regular vertices form a subcode word (with respect to a specified ordering 
of the neighbors). The following theorem is a simple con­sequence of the definition of expansion [15]. 
Theorem 1 Let r.,.,d be a (c, d)-regtdar bipartite on n vertices, with c < d, and let &#38; be an error-correcting 
code of block length d, with relative minimum distance e and mte r. The mte of the gmph code c.(rn,.,~, 
&#38;) is at least c(r -1)+ 1. Zj rn,c,~ expands by a factor of e > c/de on all sets of vertices of size 
at most an, then c(rn,@ Sd) has relative minimum distance at least a. Roughly speaking, Sipser and Spielman 
extend this result to prove that if the graph r is a sufficiently good expander and the subcode S is 
a sufficiently good code, then the code C(17,S) is good, and that a constant frac­tion of errors can 
be decoded in linear time. The de­coding algorithm is very simple and natural, but we will not need to 
discuss it here. 2.4 Codes from Cayley graphs When the underlying graph is a Cayley graph, the code 
has additional structure, as we now explain. Let Gbeafinite group andletd = {sl, sz, . . ..sd} C Gbea 
symmetric set of ordered generators; thus, ifs E A, then s-l c A. The Cayley graph I (G, A) of G with 
respect to A is the cl-regular graph having vertices indexed by G such that (g, h) is an edge if and 
only if h = s-lg for some s c A. This determina a canonical ordering on the neighbors of a vertex g: 
xi(g) = s; lg, for i = l,z,..., d. Definition 2 Let S be an error-correcting code over IF with block 
length d. The Cayley vertex code CV[G, A, S) is the subspace of all functions c : G + IF such that for 
each g c G, (cl(g), Cz(g), . . . . cd(g)) Es, (1) where c~(g) = C(S; 1g). Similarly, the Cayley edge 
code CC(G, d, S) is the subspace of all edge functions c : SI (G, A) -+ F that satisfy (1), but with 
c~(g) = c((g, S:l g)). This corresponds to a code C(I ~,z,~, S), where rn,z,d is the bipartite gmph formed 
by inserting a new vertex on each edge. If [Al is small relative to G, then the parity check matrices 
of these codes are sparse. We will refer to such codes as low-density Cayley codes. Thus, a Cayley code 
is constructed using only the graph I (G, d), but it inherits symmetries from the group. All of the 
classical cyclic codes are Cayley ver­tex codes, where the group G is Z/nZ, the subcode is a simple parity 
check, and the fundamental theorem of algebra can be used to design codes having various rates and distances. 
As will be evident, our methods apply to both vertex codes Cv (G, A, S) and edge codes Ct(G, A, S). The 
explicit expander codes of [15] are constructed using Cayley graphs of the projective special linear 
group. The graphs used are the explicit family of ex­pander graphs (the so-called Ramanujan graphs) con­structed 
by Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak [8], and in­dependently by Margulis [11]. These graphs are (p+ l)­regular 
graphs, where is p is a prime that is not a quadratic residue modulo q. Since \PSLz(Z/qZ) \ = q(q2 1)/2, 
this results in codes with block length n = (p+ l)g(g2 1)/4= 0(q3) considering p = O(1) as q+m. The 
significance of Fourier analysis lies in the fol­lowing link. Let 6A be the characteristic function of 
the generating set A. Then it immediately follows that the adjacency matrix of 17(G, A) is equal to the 
Fourier transform d~(p~g), up to a reordering of the group el­ements, where pwg denotes the right regular 
represen­t ation of G. Block diagonalization of the regular repre­sentation may be obtained using representation 
theory. Thus, if {pi, ... , Ph} is a complete set of inequivalent ir­reducible matrix representations 
of G, then there exists a change of basis such that BI o . . . 0 0 B2 . . . 0 G(preg) - ( . ,. . .+ ..) 
 where G(pi) ~ ... 0 0 dA(~i) ... 0 Bi = .:  r . ~(pi) . o0 .O. with dP, copies of dA (pi ) on the 
diagonal. In particular, spectrum (1 (G, A)) = ~ spectrum (~(pi)) . i=l This is the basic fact that 
we used in [5, 6] to investigate expanders for this group, and it is also the key idea behind our use 
of spectral methods for codes. If h : G ~ IF corresponds to a row of the parity-check matrix for the 
subcode S, then c E JFG is a codeword of the vertex code if and only if for each g E G, hAc(g) = ~ h(s) 
c(s-lg) = O. s~G Taking Fourier transforms, this is cast in the spectral domain as h~c(p) = ~(~) o~(p) 
= Od, ~dp for each p E ~. In other words, each column of ;(p) must be a sp~ctral domain codeword for 
the parity­check matrix h(p) over ~. 3 Spectral Encoding 3.1 Conjugacy constraints We firat consider 
the issue of conjugacy constmints in a general group algebra. Suppose that we wish to specify an element 
of IFlG in t~rms of its spectrum. Be­cause the Fourier transforms ~(q) take on values in an extension 
field ~ o IF[, specifying these coefficients and then taking an inverse Fourier transform is not guar­anteed 
to result in an element ~ E IFlG c ~G. There are constraints on its spectrum analogous to those for Fourier 
transforms over the complex numbers. Theorem 3ASuppase that ~ has chamcteristic r divid­ ing 1. Let {f(~ij) 
E ~}q~~ be matrices of spectml co­efficients. Then the inverse Fourier tmnsf~rrn f is an element of lFlG 
if and only ij for each q E G, ? (Vij) = ~(~[~)) (2) where q(~) is the representation dejined by q(~)(z) 
= q(x)l . Proof: First notice that the matrix coefficients given by q$) (z) = q~j(z) define a representation 
q(~) precisely because ~ has characteristic x dividing 1. This lth power map is also called the Frobenius 
automorphism of ~, and the cyclic group it generates thereby acts upon the ~­valued irreducible representations 
of G, breaking them up into orbits. Following the standard coding theory terminology ye call the% orbitsAthe 
chords of G, and denote them Gi. Thus, G = ~i Gi, where (3) for some mi depending on i. Now, if ~ E IFIG, 
then z Conversely, if ~ is constant on each chord ~i, then ap plying the Fourier inversion formula, = 
f(z), so that f E IF~G. . The usual situation in classical coding theory is that G = iZ/nZ, so the irreducible 
representations are the characters aj. In this case we have cr$) (xk) = aJ~k, with a a primitive element 
of ~~, so that o:) = ~tj. The chords are then of the form Gj = {~j, a[j, . . . . CIl J ~} for some nj 
and the conj ugacy constraints on a codeword ~z) bec~me ;(j) = ?(lj) = . . . = F(lr-lj). Notice that 
Gj and G-j are in 1:1 correspondence. Thus, if we re­strict ourselves to indices j with O < j ~ (n 1)/2, 
then .. we have chords Go, GI, ....21, ~_I, ....G_~ for some L  3.2 The algorithm We will now describe 
the encoding algorithm in some detail for Cayley edge codes since the results of [15] are obtained for 
this class. We fix a Cayley graph 17 = I (G, A). For an edge function f 6 tT(lF), we will let f(t) :G 
~ IF denote the function ~(:)(g) = f ((g, s~ g)). In this notation, an edge function c E tX (F) is a 
code­word of C(G, A, S) if and only if (~)(g)) c S for each g c G. (c( (~)!c(2)(!7)j ~~c (4) There are 
relations on the functions c(i) because the edges are unoriented. The following lemma shows how these 
relations are expressed in the spectral domain. Its proof entails a simple calculation using the homomor­phism 
property of p and the Fourier inversion formula. Lemma 4 An element c E &#38;l?(F) is a codeword oj C(G, 
A, S) if and only if for each p E ~, 1~i,j ~ dP, andl~k~d, (a) (n(Pij), (Pij), . . c,~(Pij)) ~ ~ (b,) 
~(p) = p(s:l) c?) (p) where s~ = S;l (C) Zf(pij) = (PI)) where ~ is the code over ~ obtained using the 
pan ty­check matrix of S. Proof: If H = (hlm ) is the parity-check matrix for the subcode S, then taking 
Fourier transforms of the parity checks c hlmc@J(g) =O gEG E m=l foreachl= l,..., (1 r)c yields equations 
(a) in the spectral domain. Now suppose that the co are defined from an edge function. Then for any representation 
p, c~l (p) = ~ Ca-l (g) p(g) g~G = ~ c=(a- 9) P(9) gcG = p(a) ~ c.(a-lg) p(a-lg) gcG = p(a) ~(p) using 
the homomorphism property of p. Conversely, if equations (b) and (c) hold, then by the Fourier inversion 
formula, cc-l (g) = J-  I(JI ~ad~tmce (dg-l)CTI (j?)) = &#38;~a4~~ce(f49-1) p(a) G(P)) =* ((a-19)- 
) ~G4J~ce(PG(P)) = ca(a-lg)  so that c(g, ag) = c=(g) E IF is well-defined. Equations (c)are theconjugacy 
constraints of Theorem3. . We will refer to (a) as the spectral subcode constmints, (b) as the edge constmints, 
and (c) as the conjugacy constmints. For a fixed representation p, the edge and spectral subcode constraints 
of Lemma 4 form a linear system over ~ that can be represented by a (2 r)ddP x ddP spectral-parity check 
matrix which we will denote as H(p). (A total of (1 r)ddP constraints come from the subcode S.) Algorithm 
5 (Spectml Encoding) Initial Data: 1. Low-density Cayley code C(G, d, S). 2. Complete set ~ of irreducible 
representations of G.  Initialization: 1. Compute the chords ~ = Hi ~~. 2. Choose one representation 
pi E ~~ in each chord, and reduce H (pi) to a systematic form, computing the mnk PPi over ~. The dimension 
of C(G, A, S)  is chords i To encode a vector z c @ as e(z) c IF: 1. For each distinguished pi E ~~, 
use ~atrix multi­plication by the systematic form of H(p~ ) to en­code the appropn ate piece of x as 
the matn ces @(pi), ..., ~(pi) to satisfy equations ( 1) and (2) of Lemma ~. 2. Copy the matrices c(i)(p) 
to the other elements of the chord. 3. Take inverse Fourier tmnsforms to obtain e(x).  Theorem 6 Let 
e : I@ + IF be the encoding func­tion for the Cayley code C(G, A, F) C ~ given by Algorithm 5, where 
k is the dimension computed in (5). Then e(z) can be computed in O(ra max @fP) = O(n312) opemtions. The 
initialization stage of the algo­rithm to compute the dimensi~n k of the code and the spectml parity-check 
matrices H(p) requires 0(n3f2) op­emtions and O(n) space. For the group PSL2(Z/qZ), e(z) can be computed 
in 0(n413) opemtions. Sketch of proof The matrix E(p) can be reduced to a systematic form in O(d~) operations, 
and multiplying a column of (c(l)(p), . . . . c(d)(p)) by the resulting ma­trix requires O(d~) operations. 
Thus, the total cost of encoding in the spectral domain is no more than E d;, s max dP d;= ma~dP IGI 
s lG13i2 , (6) x PEG PGGchords i pe z and we obtain the rough bound stated because the same general bound 
holds for Fourier inversion. The analysis for the initialization stage is similar. For the group PSL2 
(Z/qZ), the irreducible represen­tations occur aa O(q) matrices of size O(q); see [5]. Thus, the encoding 
of@) takes 0(q4) operations, and using the results of [12], we have the same complexity for Fourier inversion. 
. This gives a coarse estimate of the complexity of this algorithm for an arbitrary finite group, and 
an estimate for PSL2 (Z/qZ) using the latest results for Fourier anal­ysis on this group. Further improvements 
in FFT al­gorithms for PS~2 (Z/qZ) may well lead to a reduced complexity for this algorithm.  3.3 Systematic 
encoding The encoding algorithm we have outlined above for Cayley codes is nonsystematic. When used together 
with the time domain decoding procedure developed in [15], this means that although the codeword c E 
tX (lF) may be decoded from the received vector in O(n) op­erations (or O(n log n) in the logarithmic 
cost model), the original information symbols can be recovered only after then taking a Fourier transform 
of c and reading off the data in the frequency domain. Recall that a systematic encoder for cyclic codes 
can be obtained using the Euclidean algorithm. If C is an (n, k) cyclic code and d(z) is a data polynomial 
of degree k 1, this encoder first shifts the data up by multiplying by Xn-k, and then divides by the 
generating polynomial g(~). Thus, the systematic codeword is obtained as C(Z) = xn-kd(z) Rg [zn-kd(z)] 
where Rg is the remainder upon dividing by g. There does not appear to be a direct analogue of this algorithm 
in a general group algebra. One ap­proach for devising a systematic encoder is instead to exploit the 
subgroup structure of the group. For the group PSL2 (Z/qZ), the subgroups are completely known. In particular, 
the proper subgroups include dihedral groups of order 2Z where z I (q+ 1)/2 and noncommutative subgroups 
of the image (under projec­tion from SL2 (Z/qZ)) of the upper triangular subgroup B={(; ~!,)} and its 
conjugates. Theorem 7 Let C(G, A, S) be a low-density Cayley expander code, then for certain representations 
these code on PSL2 (Z/qZ) with block length n and rate r. spectral domain codes are also expander codes. 
Then C can be encoded systematically up to rate r = Let IP1(JF~)= {O, 1, . . . . q 1, cm} denote the 
projec­r 0(n-113) in 0(n4i3) opemtions. tive line over IFq. Then PSL2 (Z/qZ) acts on IPl(ll?q) by fractional 
linear transformations: Sketch of proof: For a general group G, let H be a subgroup and {s1, . . . . 
s~ } a set of coset representatives for H\G. If p is any representation and f E IFG, then = ~;(PWMSi) 
i where pJ H isthe representation p restricted to H, and fi (h) = f(hsi ). This recurrence is the basis 
for certain fast Fourier analysis algorithms; see [13]. Let m = [r {G!/ \Hlj. For the purposes of spectral 
en­coding, suppose that we can choose a subset of coset representatives {sil, . . . . si~, } such that 
whenever are given, we can choose (not necessarily uniquely), in such a way that the element of IFG this 
defines is a codeword. A systematic encoder is then obtained by placing the data symbols on the cosets 
si, H, . . . . si~, H and solving for fi~, +l, . . . ) fi~, This encoding results in a loss of rate proportional 
to IHI / IGI. To solve the required equations in the spectral do­main, we may use the fact that H-adapted 
bases can always be chosen so that for each irreducible represen­tation p, the restricted representation 
is block diagonal, where qi is an irreducible representation of H. For the group PSL2(Z/qZ), we can work 
with the image of the subgroup B c SL2(Z/qZ), with IBI = 0(q2) = 0( IG12 3). In this case, the desired 
cosets can be found and the equations solved in 0(q4) operations. The resulting encoding leads to a loss 
of rate of order o(l/q). 1  3.4 Spectral expander codes If c is a codeword of a Cayley code C(G, A, 
S), we have seen that for each irreducible representation p, each column of ;(p) is a spectral domain 
codeword of some code ~P(G, A, ~) over ~ of block length dP. We now show that if G = PSL2(Z/qZ) and C(G, 
A, S) is an 166 ab aw+b .~= . cd cu+d () The following theorem shows the relevance of this fact to Fourier 
analysis and expander codes. Theorem 8 Let C(PSL2(Z/qZ), A, S) be an ezpander code, with symbols on either 
the edges or the vertices. Then for each induced representation p+, ~ E IF;, there is a collection of 
subcodes ~$ over ~ such that c E C only if each column of ;(p$ ) is an element of the expander code C(lpl(IFq),~,~V). 
Sketch of proof: Let the matrices U=(Y1o    -Qu= -q- sm=(: be a fixed set of coset representatives 
of B\SL2 (Z/qiZ), which we identify with P l(lF~). In [5] we constructed the principal series representations 
of SL2 (Z/qZ) by in­ducing characters from B, and expressing these matri­ces in terms of their action 
on {sti }. In particular, if @ : F: + ~ is a modular character of B, then P*(9)% = v(f(W9))%8u (7) for 
some function f (u,s) E IF;, where g . SU is the W­tion of fractional linear transformation. Thus, ~(pv) 
haa non-zero entries precisely where the adjacency ma­trix of I (lP1(F~ ), d) is non-zero; we refer to 
[5] for de­tails. If I (PSL2 (Z/qZ), d) is a good expander, then I (IP1(IF~), A) is also a good expander 
since its spec­tral gap is at least aa large. In particular, the explicit Ramanujan graphs for PSL2 (Z/qZ) 
restrict to give Ra­manujan graphs on PI (IF~); see [14]. Thus, the relations (7) define a spectral domain 
expander code, where the subcode may vary with each constraint. 1 Remark 8 The existence of an analogous 
basis for the discrete series representations would show that the time domain decoding algorithm for 
expander codes studied in [15] can be carried out in the frequency domain, in­dependently for each representation, 
Remark 9 We can carry out fast Fourier analysis on PI (IFq) by working with B-invariant functions on 
PSL2 (Z/qZ) and choosing special bases for the principal series representation induced from the identity 
charac­ter. This enables the Fourier transform of a function on IP1(IFq) to be carried out in O(q log 
q) operations. It does not, however, lead to a fast convolution algorithm and thus an efficient encoding 
algorithm for expander codes on the projective line. The difficulty is that con­volution needs to be 
carried out in the full group, and the parity check function h by which we convolve is not B-invariant. 
Related Work One of the first references that we know of for non­abelian codes using the perspective 
of group algebras is MacWilliams article [9]. In this paper the difficulties of working in the time domain, 
even for the simplest example of the dihedral group, are apparent. Repre­sentation theory is not proposed 
as an essential tool. The article of Beth [2] is one of the first to consider efficient Fourier transform 
algorithms for nonabelian groups, and the paper also suggests the connection with coding. Much is now 
known about the complexities of various groups, and understanding of the relevant algo­rithms is just 
now beginning to mature. We refer to [13] for a summary of this recent work. The article of Ward [19] 
discusses aspects of the general framework for codes as ideals in the group algebra, representation theory, 
and various results related to codes with auto­morphism group PSL2 (Z/qZ) (quadratic residue codes), 
the Mathieu groups, and others. There is a fairly large literature on various groupalgebraic aspects 
of cyclic codes or codes invariant under affine groups, for exam­ple [7]. One reference closely related 
in spirit is the paper of Tanner [17], which shows that algebraic meth­ods analogous to those for cyclic 
codes can be applied to groups more general than iZ/nZ, although strong re­strictions are made to ensure 
that BCH decoding algo­rithms can be used. The applicability of representation theory is not fully recognized, 
and in particular, the hy­brid polynomial/abelian Fourier transform method that is adopted in this paper 
does not seem to extend readily to more general groups. Alon et al. [1] use the explicit Ramanujan graphs 
of PSLz(Z/qZ) to construct low rate codes that are not directly related to the Cayley codes we use here.
