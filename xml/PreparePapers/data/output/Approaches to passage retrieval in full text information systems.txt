 Approaches to Passage Retrieval in Full Text Information Systems Gerard Salton~ J. Allan, and C. Buckley 
Abstract Large collections of full-text documents are now com­monly used in automated information retrieval. 
When the stored document texts are long, the retrieval of com­plete documents may not be in the users 
best inter­est. In such circumstances, efficient and effective re­trieval results may be obtained by 
using passage re­trieval strategies designed to retrieve text excerpts of varying size in response to 
statements of user interest. New approaches are described in this study for imple­menting selective passage 
retrieval systems, and identi­fying text passages responsive to particular user needs. An automated encyclopedia 
search system is used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed methods. Introduction In operational 
retrieval environments, it is now possible to process the full text of all stored documents. Many long, 
book-sized documents are stored, often containing a mix of different topics covered in more or less detail. 
In these circumstances, it is not useful to maintain the integrity of complete undivided documents. Instead 
in­dividual text passages should be identified that are more responsive to particular user needs than 
the full docu­ment texts. Several advantages are apparent when individual text passages are independently 
accessible. First, the effi­ciency of text utilization may be improved because the users are no longer 
faced with large masses of retrieved materials, but can instead concentrate on the most im­ Department

/0049 . ..$J .5Q mediately relevant text passages. Second, the effective­ness of the retrieval activities 
may also be enhanced because relevant short texts are generally more easily retrievable than longer ones. 
The longer items covering a wide diversity of different subjects may not closely re­semble narrowly-formulated, 
specific user queries. As a result, many potentially relevant items may be rejected. When text excerpts 
are accessible, the query similarity is often higher for the text excerpts than for the corre­sponding 
full texts, leading to the retrieval of additional relevant material with corresponding improvements 
in recall and precision. Most text items are naturally subdividable into rec­ognizable units, such as 
text sections, paragraphs, and sentences. This leads to the notion of assembling text excerpts of varying 
size covering just the right amount of information to satisfy the user population. In the re­mainder 
of this study, effective methods are introduced for identifying relevant text excerpts in response to 
user interest statements, and assembling these excerpts into retrievable text passages responsive to 
individual user needs. Classical Text Excerpting Methods have been introduced in the past for the use 
of text passages in information retrieval and automatic abstracting. The standard approaches utilize 
bottom­up procedures based on the identification of important text sentences that are later assembled 
into retrievable text units. Typically, each text sentence is assigned a score, or weight, depending 
on its perceived importance in the texts under consideration. Retrievable text pas­sages, or text abstracts, 
are then formed by grouping a number of important highly-weighted sentences into units that are then 
independently processed for partic­ ular purposes. Different methods have been used for the sentence 
scoring process. Typically, weights are assigned to the individual text words, and the complete sentence 
scores are then based on the occurrence characteristics of highly-weighted terms in the respective sentences. 
In passage retrieval applications where the task consists in retrieving text excerpts that are similar 
to available user queries, the number and concentration of query words included in the individual sentences 
is used to generate thesentence score. Increasing concentrationof query terms, measuredly the closeness 
of these terms in the text sentences, leads to higher assigned sentence weights. In text abstracting, 
Or text summarization W placations where user queries are not necessarily avail­ able, the sentence score 
is similarly based on the number and concentration of text words thought to be impor­ tant in representing 
text content. In addition to using the occurrence characteristics of highly-weighted terms, the sentence 
scoring system may be influenced by a number of additional factors such as: 1. The location of the sentences 
in the texts under consideration, special importance being given to texts representing figure captions, 
titles, and sec­tion headings. 2. The inclusion in the sentences of special clue words and clue phrases 
that are thought to be impor­tant in the determination of typicality and sentence value. 3. The use 
of syntactic relationships detected between particular words and sentences-in the text, indicat­ing that 
the corresponding text units are related and ought to be jointly retrieved. [1-8]  Various procedures 
have also been suggested for assem­ bling individual text sentences into meaningful larger units. For 
example, specific rules have been proposed for generating so-called connected, concentrated, and compound 
text passages. [9-11] Unfortunately, it is difficult to produce readable text passages by using the low-level 
term-weighting approaches normally available for this purpose. Al­ ternative strategies have therefore 
been advocated for use in text abstracting and summarization based on deep semantic analysis techniques, 
and the use of pre­ constructed frames, or templates, that are appropri­ ately filled by information 
extracted from the document texts. [12-13] It is possible that approaches based on deep knowledge of 
particular subject fields will be use­ ful for restricted tasks, such as, for example, the con­ struction 
of medical summaries of certain types. When unrestricted subject matter must be treated, as is of­ ten 
the case in practice, the passage retrieval and text summarization methods proposed heretofore have not 
proven equal to the need. One suggestion that may represent a step in the right direction is based on 
the use of text paragraphs, rather than sentences for the construction of text passages. In that case, 
relationships are computed between individ­ ual text paragraphs, based on the number of common text components 
in the respective paragraphs. Certain paragraphs are then chosen for abstracting purposes, re­placing 
the originally available texts. [14] In the present study, the use of complete paragraphs is generalized 
to include text passages of varying length, covering the subject at varying levels of detail, and responding 
to varying kinds of user needs. A top-down approach is used whereby large text excerpts are chosen first, 
that are successively broken down into smaller pieces cover­ing increasingly specific user needs. This 
makes it possi­ble to retrieve full texts, text sections, text paragraphs, or sets of adjacent sentences 
depending on particular user requirements. Global-Local Processing in Text Analysis and Ret rieval The 
Smart retrieval strategies are based on the vector processing model, where document and query texts are 
represented by sets, or vectors, of weighted terms. A term may be a word stem, or phrase, included in 
a particular text, and the term weights are chosen so as to favor terms that occur with high frequency 
inside particular documents, while being relatively rare in the collection as a whole. [15] To determine 
the similarity between a query and a stored document, or between two stored documents, the corresponding 
term vectors are compared, and coefficients of similarity are computed based on the number and the weight 
of common terms included in a vector pair. This makes it possible to rank the documents at the output 
in decreasing order of the computed query similarity. The global vector similarity reflects global coinci­dence 
between query and document texts. The assump­tion is that when two vectors do not exhibit a given min­imal 
global similarity, the corresponding texts are not related. Documents whose query similarity falls below 
a stated threshold are therefore rejected. The reverse as­sumption may or may not hold, that is, when 
the global similarity between two vectors is sufficiently large, the texts may nevertheless be unrelated 
because the com­mon vocabulary may be used in different senses in the respective texts. Thus, based on 
a global vector similar­ity computation, documents about table salt might be retrieved in answer to queries 
about the SALT treaties. Problems caused by language ambiguity can be largely solved by making appeal 
to the use theory of meaning proposed by Wittgenstein and others, which states that the meaning of words 
and expressions de­pends on the use of these words in the language. [16] This suggests that linguistic 
ambiguities and multiple meanings can be eliminated by checking the local con­text in which text words 
and expressions occur. The linguistic context of a term such as salt is likely to be the same for many 
different texts dealing with the SALT treaties. The same is true for texts discussing table salt. On 
the other hand, the contexts differ when Query: [9562] Gall (Parasitic growth in plants) Ret rieved Simple

for Query [9562] Gall (removal of 7 nonrelevant (N) items and 1 relevant (R) item) the query texts are 
related to arms control but the doc­uments deal with food consumption. In practice, a dual text comparison 
system can be used, designed to verify both the global similarity be­tween query and document texts, 
as well as the coinci­dence in the respective local contexts: [17,18] 1. The global text similarity is 
computed first by com­paring the respective term vectors as previously ex­plained. Text pairs without 
sufficient globad simi­larity are not further considered. 2. The local text environments are considered 
next for texts with sufficient global similarity, and local structures included in the texts such as 
sections, paragraphs and sentences are compared. When globally similar text pairs also contain a sufficient 
number of locally similar substructures, th{e texts are assumed to be related.  The effect of the global/local 
text comparison system is illustrated in the example of Table 1. Here an arti­cle included in the Funk 
and Wagnalls encyclopedia is used as a search request, and other related encyclopedia articles are retrieved 
in response to the query articles. [19] Table 1 shows the 20 items exhibiting the highest similarity 
with the query article Gall (article number [9562]) based on the global vector similarity between query 
and retrieved article texts. Normally a minimum threshold of 0.20 applies for retrieval purposes, and 
doc­uments with smaller global similarities are rejected. The list of retrieved articles shown in Table 
1 includes for the most part relevant items dealing with parasitic insects that cause the formation of 
galls in plants. Un­fortunately, a number of extraneous documents are in­cluded on the list of items 
in Table 1, such as Galle , a city in Sri Lanka, and J.M.W. Turner , a British painter. The retrieval 
errors are produced by the term truncation used in constructing the term vectors: nor­mally word stems, 
rather than complete words, are used in the query and document vectors, so that terms such as igallery 
, Galla , gallium , and so on, are all re­duced to gall, matching the term gall in the query. The left-most 
column of bullets in Table 1, entitled unrestricted output , identifies the top 18 items that are retrieved 
in answer to [9562] Gall by the simple global vector similarity computation. The next column to the 
right entitled simple sentence match represents a local retrieval strategy where at least one matching 
pair of sentences must be found in query and retrieved document texts above a sentence matching threshold 
of 75.0 in addition to a sufficiently large global similar­ity. [17,18] As the middle column of bullets 
shows, six of the originally retrieved items do not fulfill the sim­ple local sentence matching requirement. 
This includes five obviously nonrelevant items (article [170] Acorn is not relevant because the whole 
article consists of only a cross-reference to another article), plus a possibly rele­vant item, [18228] 
Phylloxera, that appears at the bot­tom of the list. 1. Global Text 2. Simple 3. Restricted 4. output

(full relevance assessments for all retrieved items) Table 2: Evaluation of Global/Local The sentence 
matching strategy used to carry out the simple sentence match is based on a straightfor­ward computation 
of pair-wise sentence similarity be­tween all sentence pairs in the respective query and document texts. 
When a term is highly weighted, as is the case for gall in most of the retrieved articles, the required 
sentence similarity threshold of 75.0 may be reached even though a sentence pair has only that sin­gle 
term in common without additional matching con­text. To avoid that possibility, a restricted sentence 
match requirement can be used specifying that at least two matching terms must be present in a matching 
sen­tence pair, with no single term contributing more than 90 percent of the total sentence similarity. 
The right­most column of Table 1 shows that the two remaining nonrelevant items ([23008] J.M.W. Turner 
and [20402] St. Gallen) are now rejected because of the restricted local sentence match requirement. 
An evaluation of the global/local text matching sys­tem is presented in the first 3 columns of figures 
of Table 2(a). The results of Table 2(a) are average recall and precision figures obtained by using as 
queries all ency­clopedia articles starting with the letter G, and compar­ing them with all other encyclopedia 
articles. A global similarity threshold of 0.20 is used, and all query articles are included in the evaluation 
for which the relevance assessors found at least one relevant document. This represents a total of 982 
G queries. Full relevance Text Comparison and Passage Retrieval data were obtained from the owners of 
the encyclopedia for all articles retrieved by the simple sentence match (run 2 of Table 2(a)), but not 
for the extra 5,000 doc­uments retrieved by the unrestricted run 1 that were rejected by the local sentence-matching 
process of run 2. All these items are treated as nonrelevant in the eval­uation of Table 2(a). The detailed 
example of Table 1 shows that items rejected by the local matching process are indeed generally nonrelevant. 
This is also confirmed by the detailed recall and precision figures included in Table 2(a) which both 
increase sharply between runs 1 and 2. The precision figures included in Table 2 are exact; the recall 
figures must be interpreted as relative re­call representing the total number of retrieved relevant items 
divided by the total number of known relevant for each query. Overall, the average precision improves 
by 9 percent over the unrestricted global text match of run 1 when the simple local sentence match is 
used, and by an additional 2 percent for the restricted sentence matching system. Retrieval of Text Excerpts

document texts are in­volved, Second, a potential loss in retrieval effective­ness (recall) occurs because 
the global query similarity of the long, discursive documents that cover a number of different topics 
will be low, implying that many long documents will be rejected, even when they contain rel­evant passages. 
The user overload can be reduced and the retrieval effectiveness enhanced by making it possible to retrieve 
text passages instead of full documents only, whenever the query similarity of a text excerpt is larger 
th~an the similarity of the complete document. This suggests that a hierarchical text decomposition system 
be used which successively considers for retrieval text sections, text paragraphs, and sets of adjacent 
text sentences. In each case, the text excerpt with the highest query similarity may be presented to 
the user first, while providing op­tions for obtaining larger or smaller text pieces. Because of the 
local context checking requirement used for re­trieval purposes, text excerpts such as paragraphs and 
sentences are already individually accessible, and the additional resources needed for passage retrievid 
pur­poses are relatively modest. The basic operations of a section and paragraph re­trieval capability 
are illustrated in Table 3 for the query [9562] Gall, previously used in the illustration of Table 1. 
The left-most column of bullets in Table 3 corre­sponds to the restricted sentence match retrieving full 
documents only (equivalent to the right-most column of bullets in Table 1). In the middle column of Table 
3, text sections are retrievable in addition to full docu­ments, with the right-most column covering 
paragraph retrieval as well as sections and full text items. The move to section retrieval promotes a 
number of retrieved items. Thus, the full article on Insects [12134] which contains 43 text paragraphs 
is replaced by sec­tion 10 of that article describing insect reproduction, and particularly the reproduction 
of gall wasps. Fur­thermore, the query similarity for vector [12 134.c1O] is 0.32, instead of 0.27 for 
the full document. This lifts the material on insects from retrieval rank 4 to rank 1. The section retrieval 
system also raises a previously unretrieved relevant item above the retrieval threshold of 0.20. Table 
3 shows that the article on Wasps [23827] was originally rejected because of the low query simi­larity 
of 0.19. The query similarity for Section 4 of that article ([23827.c4] ) reaches 0.20, leading to the 
retrieval of that relevant item. Additional relevant items are promoted when para­graphs are added to 
the retrieval process as shown in the right-most column of Table 3. Thus, [11913] Ich­neumon Fly is lifted 
from rank 14 to rank 12, [11847] Hymenopteran is raised from rank 7 to rank 2, and sec­tion 5 on Parasitic 
Plants ([17675 .c5]) is replaced by paragraph 6 of that document ( [17675 .p6]) and raised from rank 
5 to rank 3. The effects of the passage retrieval capability are further detailed in the example of 
Table 4, covering a retrieval run for query [9561] on Galileo. Here all items retrieved by the restricted 
sentence match are relevant to the query, but the section and paragraph retrieval strategies are able 
to locate large numbers of previously unretrieved relevant items. A comparison of the three columns of 
bullets in Table 4 shows that the six originally retrieved full-text items are replaced by four full 
text items plus 8 text sections (see the middle columns representing section retrieval), and by one full­text 
item, two text sections, and 17 text paragraphs in the right-most column covering paragraph and section 
retrieval in addition to full texts. Query: [9561] Galileo Restricted output Section and Retrieved Query

Retrieval of Text Excerpts for Query [9561] Galileo (ci = section z ; Pj = paragraph j) All the long, 
originally retrieved items, such as [1640] Astronomy (39 paragraphs), and [20683] Science (25 paragraphs), 
are subdivided in the passage retrieval mode, and the retrieved sections and paragraphs are much more 
closely related to the query topic [9561] Galileo than the original full articles. Furthermore, a large 
number of long, originally rejected articles are re­trieved in the passage retrieval mode, including 
very long items such as the documents on Physics [18234] containing 146 para graphs of text, and on Philosophy 
[18179] containing 117 paragraphs. Many shorter rel­ evant items are also obtained for the first time 
in the passage retrieval mode, including [6284] Cosmology (30 paragraphs), [12132] Inquisition (21 paragraphs), 
and [19463] Renaissance (27 paragraphs). The efficiency improvements provided by the section and paragraph 
retrieval modes are illustrated at the bottom of Table 4. When full documents are retrieved, the average 
number of paragraphs contained in each re­trieved item is nearly 16 for the Galileo query. This drops 
to only a little over 5 paragraphs per retrieved item in the section mode, and to only 1.3 paragraphs 
on average for the combined section plus paragraph mode. For the 982 query articles that start with the 
letter G, the average reduction in retrieved text length is 43 percent for the section retrieval, and 
54 percent for paragraph retrieval. The users necessarily benefit when shorter text excerpts are obtained 
that are immediately related to the query topic instead of only full-text items. The effectiveness of 
the section and paragraph re­trieval is reflected by the evaluation data appearing in the two right-most 
columns of Table 2(a), covering sec­tion, and section plus paragraph retrieval, respectively, The recall 
and precision figures show that the passage retrieval techniques furnish substantially better output 
than the standard restricted sentence match for full doc­uments alone. The average precision data of 
Table 2(a) show that the section output (run 4) is about 9 percent better than the restricted sentence 
match of run 3. This indicates that the vast majority of the 1,000 or so addi­tional documents obtainable 
through the section output are indeed relevant, as shown earlier in the examples of Tables 3 and 4. Unfortunately, 
the actual improvements obtained by the full section and paragraph retrieval system (run 5) are understated 
in Table 2(a). Full relevance irlforma­ tion was available only for the section retrieval, but not for 
section plus paragraph output. The improvement in retrieval effectiveness shown in the right-most (column 
of Table 2(a) is then due entirely to changes in the re­trieval ranks of originally retrieved relevant 
iterns that are promoted by the section and paragraph retrieval system. The newly retrieved, originally 
rejectedl, items obtained in the paragraph mode, exemplified by the re­trieval of [12083.P6] Inertia 
and [18353.P6] Piss in Table 4, are all treated as nonrelevant in the evaluation since no relevance data 
were available for these items. This explains the apparent deterioration in performance be­tween section 
and paragraph outputs (runs 4 and 5 of Table 2(a). Table 2(b) contains complete evaluation data, for 
90 of the G queries previously included in Table 2(a) for which full relevance data were available. Table 
2(b) shows that the actual improvement to be expected with the section output is about 10 percent over 
the re­stricted sentence match, with an additional 8 lpercent improvement for the paragraph output. If 
that addi­tional 8 percent improvement were applied to the out­put of Table 2(a) for the complete query 
set, the average precision for run 5 would increase to 0.9280, giving an advantage of nearly 25 percent 
over the base run 1 for the complete set of 982 queries. These extrapolated fig­ures are shown in parentheses 
to the right of column 5 in Table 2(a). The Galileo example of Table 4 shows that sections and paragraphs 
retrieved by the passage retrieval system are indeed relevant to the query topic, confirming to some 
extent the accuracy of the extrapo­lated performance figures. The performance of the global/local text 
mi~tching and text passage retrieval systems can be assessed by noting the variations in the figures 
given in the first and last rows of Table 2. The unrestricted global text match first retrieves a large 
number of items, many of which are deleted by the local sentence-matching process. The local text match 
thus acts as a precision device that rejects many previously retrieved nonrelevant items re­ducing the 
total retrieved from 17,328 to 11,296 overall. The passage retrieval system then acts as a recall device 
by adding text excerpts from relevant items that were not obtained earlier, and increasing the total 
number of retrieved items from about 11,300 to about 13,200. The combined effect of these procedures 
appears to im­prove retrieval effectiveness by about 25 percent over the unrestricted global text match. 
Toward Flexible Automatic Passage Re­trieval The section and paragraph retrieval strategies outlined 
earlier are used to retrieve the most closely matching text sections and text paragraphs in answer to 
avail­able query articles, In the earlier discussion, relatively general query statements were used to 
specify the re­trieval context, covering, for example, the life and works of Galileo , or characteristics 
and causes of galls in plants . In many practical environments, it is desir­able to extend the retrieval 
capability to much more specific contexts, for example, the effect of Galileo s discoveries on the philosophical 
thought of the times , or the effect of gall wasps on the health of oak trees . In these circumstances 
the search context must be sub­stantially narrowed, and methods must be introduced for providing variable-length 
retrieval output at various levels of detail depending on particular user require­ments. One possibility 
consists in using search strategies ca­pable of isolating variable-length text fragments from a variety 
of related documents, to be assembled into retrieval units covering the desired subject areas in de­tail. 
Consider, as an example, a request dealing with the philosophical influence of Galileo. It seems reasonable 
to carry out a dual search first of the Philosophy article (document [18179]) in the Galileo context, 
that is, us­ing the Galileo article (document [9561]) as a query, and then of the Galileo article in 
the context of Philosophy. By using a moving window containing n sentences at a time, it is possible 
to isolate n-sentence fragments that closely match a given query context. Table 5(a) shows some typical 
three-sentence fragments from arti­cle [9561] Galileo whose global similarity with [18179] Philosophy 
exceeds 0.10. Table 5(b) similarly contains three-sentence fragments from [18179] Philosophy ob­tained 
in response to query [9561] Galileo. To generate answers in response to specific queries about the philosophical 
impact of Galileo s work, it may be useful to combine related fragments obtained from various sources 
(articles [9561] Galileo and [18179] Phi­losophy in the present case). Sample similarity mea­surements 
between the three-sentence fragments of Ta­ble 5 are shown in Table 6(a). An examination of the fragment 
texts reveals close relationships in many cases. For example, fragments 516-18 from article [9561] and 
s234-236 from [18179] both deal with aspects of the Copernican theory for the movement of planets around 
the sun. These fragments would therefore be combined in answer to an appropriate query. Similarly fragments 
s49-51 from [9561] Galileo and s251-253 from [18179] Philosophy specifically deal with the role of Galileo 
in shaping the philosophical thought of his time by intro­ducing experimental approaches in physics. 
The text passage constructed from the text fragments used in the last example is reproduced in Table 
6(b). Such a passage may be generated automatically in answer to queries about the philosophical contributions 
of Galileo. Detailed experiments with text passage construction of this type remain to be carried out.

Adjacent Sentence Fragments(3 Sentences) At Padua, Galileo invented a calculating compass for the practical 
solution of mathemat­ical problems. He turned from speculative physics to careful measurements, discovered 
the law of falling bodies and of the parabolic path of projectiles, studied the motions of pendu­lums, 
and investigated mechanics and the strength of materials. He showed little interest in astronomy, although 
beginning in 1!595 he preferred the Copernican theory (see Astronomy: The Copernican Theory )-that the 
earth revolves around the sun to the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic assumption that planets circle a fixed 
earth. Similarity Coefficient With Query 0.1012 s28-30 Professors of philosophy scorned Galileo s discoveries 
becanse Aristotle had held that only perfectly spherical bodies could exist in the heavens and that nothing 
new could ever appear there. Galileo also disputed with professors at Florence and Piss over hydrostatics, 
and he published a book on floating bodies in 1612, Four printed attacks on this book followed, rejecting 
Galileo s physics. 0.1958 s49-51 Galileo s most valuable scientific ccmtribution was his founding of 
physics on precise mea­surements rather than on metaphysical principles and formal logic. More widely 
influential, however, were The Starry Messenger and the Dialogue, which opened new vistas in astron­omy. 
Galileo s lifelong struggle to free scientific inquiry from restriction by philosophical and theological 
interference stands beyond science. 0.1912 a) Typical Three-Sentence Fragments from [9561] Obtained in 
Response to [18179] Philosophy Galileo s234-236 In the 15th and 16th centuries a revival of scientific 
interest in nature was accompanied by a tendency toward pantheistic mysticism. The Roman Catholic prelate 
Nicholas of Cuss anticipated the work of the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in his suggestion 
that the earth moved around the sun, thus displacing humanity from the center of the universe; he also 
conceived of the universe as infinite and identical with God. The Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, 
who similarly identified the universe with God, developed the philosophical implications of the Copernican 
theory. 0.1870 s251-253 The work of Galileo was of even grenter importance in the development of a new 
world view. Galileo brought attention to the importance of applying mathematics to the formulation of 
scientific laws, This he accomplished by creating the science of mechanics, which applied the principles 
of geometry to the motions of hodies. 0.5800 b) Typical Three-Sentence Obtained in Fragments Response
