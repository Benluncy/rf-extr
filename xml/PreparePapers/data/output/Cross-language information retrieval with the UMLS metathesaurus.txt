an automatic method for Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) that uti- lizes the multilingual 
UMLS Metathesaurus to translate Spanish and French natural language queries into En-glish. Two experiments 
are presented using OHSUMED, a subset of MEDLINE. Both experiments examine re-trieval effectiveness of 
the translated queries. However, in the second experiment, the query translation procedure is augmented 
with digram based vocabulary normaliza-tion procedures. In this comparative study of retrieval effectiveness 
the measures used are: 11-point-average precision score (11-AvgP); average interpolated preci-sion at 
recall of 0.1; and noninterpolated (i.e., exact) precision after 10 retrieved documents. Our results 
in- dicate that for Spanish the UMLS Metathesaurus based CLIR method appears equivalent to multilingual 
dictio-nary based approaches investigated in the current litera- ture French yields less favorable results 
and our analysis suggests that linguistic differences may have caused the performance differences. 1 
Introduction Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) refers to retrieval when the query and the database 
are in different languages. This form of retrieval is increasingly relevant as network-based resources 
become commonplace. There are several ways for handling CLIR. One approach that has received significant 
attention is to translate the query thereby transforming the CLIR problem into a mono-lingual information 
retrieval (MLIR) problem for which there are standard solutions [2, 81. A second approach is to translate 
the document [19]. A third approach re-ceiving increasing attention is to automatically establish associations 
between queries and documents independent of language difference [6, 10, 211. CLIR methods involv-ing 
machine translation systems, bilingual dictionaries, parallel and comparable collections are currently 
being Permission to make digital/hard copy of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use

class of CLIR resources. We present here an investigation of the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) 
[20] Metathesaurus, a product of the National Library of Medicine, as a re- source for free-text retrieval 
against a MEDLINE test database (English) given Spanish and French queries. In Oard s hierarchical classification 
scheme of the CLIR methods [17], our work falls under the thesaurus based free-text CLIR category. In 
pure thesaurus based retrieval, documents and queries are matched through their thesaurus based rep-resentations, 
with document representations derived by an indexer and query representations provided by users. Extending 
this to CLIR is straightforward given a multi- lingual thesaurus. However, there are at least two prob- 
lems: it can be difficult for users to think in terms of a controlled vocabulary [17]; and this retrieval 
method ignores the free-text portions of documents during re-trieval. Our thesaurus based CLIR approach 
seeks to overcome both problems, allowing free-text user queries and considering the free-text portions 
of documents dur-ing retrieval. More generally, this research is motivated by the fact that, relative 
to dictionaries and collection based strategies, thesauri remain unexplored in the re-cent CLIR context. 
 2 Background and Related Work Major approaches for CLIR include bilingual dictionar-ies [3, 7, 141, 
parallel collections [4, 7, 10, 61 and com-parable collections [26] or some combination of these. Documents 
of a comparable collection may be aligned at the document, sentence or even word level. Compara-ble collections 
raise interesting research questions, such as alignment strategies and the measurement of domain shift 
as explored for example, by Oard [17]. Methods baaed on dictionaries typically begin by de- riving a 
transfer dictionary specifying term equivalences across languages which is then applied to query transla- 
tion. Hull and Grefenstette use an online English-French dictionary to translate 50 queries from the 
TIPSTER col-lection (141. Query words are first morphologically re-duced to their root forms and then 
substituted by dic- tionary equivalents yielding an average precision at 5, 10, 15 and 20 retrieved documents 
of 0.235, compared to an MLIR baseline of 0.393. As the authors and other researchers point out, this 
method is troubled by incom- plete dictionaries and ambiguities in translation. Dis- ambiguation strategies 
are typically employed to reduce translation errors. Davis [7] explores three different dis- ambiguation 
strategies while using the Collins English- Spanish dictionary to translate 25 Spanish queries into English. 
The first uses part of speech (POS) informa- tion to constrain translation. The second uses a parallel 
corpus aligned at the sentence and double-sentence levels to select Spanish terms that have the most 
in common with the English query. The third combines POS with a corpus based refinement strategy, yielding 
the best per- formance, 73.5% of MLIR (non interpolated average pre- cision) with the corpus based strategy 
adding the last 6%. In an earlier paper Davis and Dunning apply an evolutionary approach, optimizing 
for translated query performance using parallel collections [9]. The dictionary based CLIR work by Ballesteros 
and Croft [3] takes a different slant to reducing transla-tion ambiguity, exploring the value of pre-and 
post-translation query expansion strategies. Their evaluation with 25 queries of a TREC datab&#38;e using 
the Collins English-Spanish dictionary indicates that expanding the query both before and after translation 
reduces errors and yields 68% of the corresponding MLIR baseline. Their research also supports the findings 
of Hull and Grefenstette [14] that phrase translations are important for CLIR. Corpus based methods have 
also been investigated in-dependent of dictionaries. Davis and Dunning replace English query terms by 
the 100 most frequent terms in the top 100 documents retrieved from the Spanish side of an English-Spanish 
parallel collection. Similarly, the CL- LSI approach [lo] uses a parallel training corpus to com-pute 
a mapping from sparse term-based vectors to short and dense conceptual vectors suppressing cross language 
variations. More recently the generalized vector space model has shown good potential for CLIR [6]. Thirteen 
groups participated in the CLIR track intro- duced in TREC-6, with documents and queries in Ger- man, 
English, French and queries in Dutch and Spanish as well. Dictionary based CLIR was explored by sev-eral 
groups including New Mexico State University [8], University of Massachusetts [l], and the Xerox Research 
Center Europe [ll]. Groups such as ETH [15], and a collaboration between the University of Colorado, 
Duke University and Microsoft [21] investigated corpus based methods. Of particular interest to us is 
the ETH ap-proach using similarity thesauri constructed from com-parable documents of the SDA collection 
in French and German. The construction process used derives from term similarity as described in [25]. 
Unique angles in TREC-6 include document translation based CLIR [19] explored by the University of Maryland 
using the LO-GOS system. According to the authors, it appears that document translation performs at least 
as well as query translation. As reported in [24], another interesting angle in the CLIR track is the 
approach taken by Cor- nell University wherein they exploit the fact that there are many similar looking 
words between French and En- glish, i.e., near cognates. Interestingly, this assumption yielded good 
results in the English-F rench CLIR runs. As summarized by Schauble and Sheridan [24] the TREC-6 CLIR 
results appear consistent with previous results in that the performances typically range between 50 and 
75% of the corresponding monolingual baselines. From our perspective, it is evident that given the nature 
of the TREC collections, CLIR approaches based upon multi-lingual thesauri remain difficult to explore. 
Our approach to CLIR in MEDLINE is to exploit the UMLS Metathe- saurus and its multilingual components. 
 Soergel describes a general framework for the use of multilingual thesauri in CLIR [27], noting that 
a num-ber of operational European systems employ multilin-gual thesauri (such as UDC and LCSH) for indexing 
and searching. However, except for very early work with small databases [22], there has been little empirical 
eval-uation of multilingual thesauri (controlled vocabularies) in the context of free-text based CLIR, 
particularIy when compared to dictionary and corpus-based methods. This may be due to the expense of 
constructing multilingual thesauri, but this expense is unlikely to be any more than that of creating 
bilingual dictionaries or even re-alistic parallel collections. In fact, ongoing efforts such as the 
EC-funded EuroWordNet project indicate that such resources can be built collaboratively and semi-automatically 
[12]. In EuroWordNet, the goal is to ex-tend the WordNet thesaurus 1161 to include Dutch, Ital-ian, Spanish 
and English words. Multilingual thesauri can be built quite effectively by merging existing mono-lingual 
thesauri [27]; the UMLS Metathesaurus is an ex-cellent current example. Combining the UMLS Metathe-saurus 
with a MEDLINE test database enables an empir- ical investigation of a high quality multilingual thesaurus 
as a resource for free-text based CLIR using two broad approaches: document translation and query translation. 
We investigate query translation based CLIR here. Our approach is independent of stemmers, part of speech 
taggers and parsers. (We wish to get baseline re-sults first before involving these additional techniques.) 
Comparable approaches include those conducted using bilingual dictionaries and similarity thesauri. In 
general these strategies yield performance scores in the range of 50 to 75% of the corresponding monolingual 
baselines. Our goal is to assess the UMLS Metathesaurus based CLIR approach within this context. The 
reader is re-ferred to the technical report by Oard and Dorr for an excellent review of the CLIR literature 
[18]. 3 Methods 3.1 OHSUMED Test Set. We utilize the OHSUMED test database, a subset of the MEDLINE database, 
extracted for retrieval research [13]. This database is accompanied by a collection of 106 En- glish 
language queries . For our cross language experi-ments, these 106 queries are first translated into Span-ish 
by a native Spanish speaker and into French by the Translation Laboratory at the University of Iowa. 
The Spanish/French versions are then translated back into English by our automatic method. The original 
English queries provide our baseline performance. 3.2 Retrieval System We use SMART [23] to identify 
appropriate Spanish/fiench UMLS phrases for each query and to run the retrieval ex-periments. We use 
the corrected versions of these queries. For al1 but 5 queries, relevant document subsets are known. 
Please see ftp://medir.ohsu.edu/pub/ohsumed for d&#38;ails. We use the 233,445 document subset that contains 
abstracts and MeSH phrases for each document. 3.3 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) The UMLS, a 
vocabulary system produced by the Na- tional Library of Medicine, has four components: the Metathesaurus, 
Semantic Network, Information Sources Map and the SPECIALIST Lexicon [20]. We use only the Metathesaurus, 
an integration of more than 40 inde- pendent vocabularies in the health care domain. The Metathesaurus 
model involves the notions of concept, term and string. Lexical variants are linked under the same term, 
while variations (such as case) only define independent strings, where certain strings desig- nated as 
preferred forms for each concept. The 1997 Metathesaurus contains 331,756 concepts, 571,768 terms and 
739,439 strings. The Metathesaurus is multilingual. French, Spanish, Portuguese and German translations 
of the MeSH subset of the UMLS are linked to their Con- cept hierarchies. There are 23,198, 23,093, 18,429 
and 18,277 MeSH concepts with Spanish, Portuguese, Ger- man and French strings respectively. We investigate 
both Spanish (the highest represented) and French (the least represented) languages in the UMLS. This 
pair will allow us to examine the effect of representation level on CLIR performance. 3.4 Transfer Dictionaries 
Derived from the UMLS The remaining resource used is a transfer dictionary, which we derive from the 
multilingual subset of the Metathesaurus. A transfer dictionar specifies phrase I equivalences tied to 
common concepts . The Spanish in- formation (23,198 concepts, 32,282 unique strings and 22,891 unique 
words) and French information (18,277 concepts, 25,932 unique strings, and 18,179 unique words) form 
the foundation of our approach. Each language has an index file (mrwx.spa for Spanish and mrwx.fre for 
French) provided as part of the UMLS which contain the unique Spanish/French words found in the Metathe- 
saurus and link them to their associated Concept num-bers. The indexes hence also serve as indexes for 
our transfer dictionaries. The Spanish or French query arrives as a (potentially ill-formed) sentence. 
The Spanish/French MeSH entries of the transfer dictionaries derived from the Metathe-saurus contain 
phrases. Hence we must first identify ap- propriate Spanish/French MeSH phrases for a query be- fore 
translating these into English using the dictionaries. The effectiveness of the CLIR process depends 
upon this first non-trivial categorization step. The simplest selection strategy is to use the word based 
indexes (mrwx.spa and mrwx.fre) for the Span-ish/French MeSH phrases to pull out all phrases that contain 
at least one of the query words3. However, we would like to identify the set of Spanish/French MeSH phrases 
for the query as a whole. For example, we would like more important query terms to have a greater role 
in the selection of MeSH terms than less important terms. We would like to weight both the query words 
and the MeSH phrases by their statistical features (IDF, DF etc.) and consider these weights during phrase 
selection. A 2Researchers have remarked upon the non-trivial effort re-quired in deriving a transfer.dictionary 
1141 from bilingual dic-tionaries. In contrast, our phrase equivalences are created using straightforward 
UNIX shell commands such as grep. Recently Brown [4] tested a relatively straightforward method for deriving 
a transfer dictionary from a sentence aligned parallel corpus. sThis method is similar to those used 
to determine word-by-word translations from dictionaries [2, 141. standard index lookup procedure ignores 
such weights. Finally, comparable to the disambiguation strategies in dictionary based research, MeSH 
phrases selected in this SMART based procedure go through a pruning phase to remove irrelevant entries 
as described in Section 3.6.  3.5 Selecting Spanish/French MeSH Phrases for Queries We first create 
a SMART database (see Table 1) for each language using its UMLS index file. There are a total of 22,891 
unique Spanish word entries in the mrxw.spa in-dex and hence in the database and 18,179 records in the 
French index database. These are indexed by SMART without stemming following the removal of stopwords4, 
using the ate weighting scheme. Two separate index vectors are created, one for the .W field and the 
other for the .C field. We then retrieve database records for the free-text Spanish/French queries, indexed 
using the atn scheme. We retrieve by comparing the words in the Spanish/French query with the .W field 
of the database records and analyzing the top N records to identify the A4 most important concepts. It 
is essentially in this step that SMART offers the advantage of weights to distin-guish between the concepts. 
We then temporarily as-sign the Spanish/French phrases corresponding to the se- lected M concepts to 
the query5. Readers familiar with previous query expansion work with MEDLINE [28] and TREC (51 may recognize 
the retrieval feedback or near- est neighbor flavor in this approach. A sample query and the Spanish 
concepts identified in this step appear at the top of Table 2. (Since the procedures used are identical 
for both Spanish and French, we limit our examples and tables to Spanish for simplicity). Mask numbers 
(i.e., word positions in the query, ignoring trivial words) ap-pear next to non-trivial Spanish query 
words. For each concept, the table shows the concept#, string#, Spanish phrase, mask# values and English 
phrase. 3.6 Refining the Selected Set of Spanish/French MeSH Phrases Many of the phrases are irrelevant 
to the query, as shown in Table 2, so we next refine this set, selecting from a number of strategies. 
In combination strategies, each refinement step acts only upon the Spanish query that remains after the 
previous refinement step. We use the example of Table 2 to explain these strategies. . Full Matches (FM): 
Only MeSH phrases composed entirely of query words are retained. We always carry out this re-finement 
procedure. (The remaining optional re-finement strategies are tested only following this full match criteria.) 
Selected Spanish Phrases: causa, cancer, pecho, es- trogenos Final English Query: causation, cancer, 
thorax, es- trogens We use a 351 word Spanish stoplist and a 355 word French stoplist Given the database 
schema, each query word is going to re-trieve at most one database record. Thus the best value for N 
is the number of informative query words. After examining the test queries, this was set to 10. Since 
we have follow up refinement steps in our CLIR approach, we set M, the number of concepts identified 
for each query, to 15. ~nrnbase Schema Field Explanation .I Ftceord ID. .w .c Spanish wordListof UMLS

smallest String # (given by the UMLS producers). Applying this strategy after the FM strategy yields:

Word Based Translation (D): A special word based translation dictionary lim-ited to the (remaining) query 
words is built as fol- lows. For a given word, identify the Spanish MeSH phrases containing it and extract 
the correspond-ing English MeSH phrases. Then list the words in these phrases and select the most frequent 
word as the translation. Applying this strategy after the FM strategy yields: Remaining Spanish Query:

causation, cancer, thorax, es-trogens, therapy, replacement Thus the remaining query words terapia and

words are simply added to the final query. Applying this strategy after the FM strategy yields: Remaining

included as each combination s initial step. Note that the same refinement procedures are used for the 
French collection. 4 Retrieval Experiment 1. The goal is to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the 
UMLS Metathesaurus based query translation strate-gies. Searches are conducted against the free-text, 
i.e., title and abstracts of the OHSUMED documents. For each run the baseline is defined by retrieval 
using the original English query that came with the OHSUMED databa&#38;. Indexing is done using stemming 
and after We recognize that this baseline ignores any effects of the trans-lation of the original English 
query into Spanish and French by our native speaker. Precision - 0.00 0.5454 0.3682 0.10 0.4600 0.3270

experimen-tation, ann weights are used on documents and atn on queries . 4.1 Performance Measures We 
use three performance measures. The first is ll-AvgP or the average of precision at 11 standard recall 
points (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . . 1.0). In CLIR, given the expense of translation, a user is likely to be 
interested in the top few retrieved documents. Thus, our second measure is average interpolated precision 
at 0.10 recall. However, since the actual numbers behind this level of recall can vary considerably across 
queries, we also compute the noninterpolated (i.e., exact) precision scores for the top ranking documents, 
and focus particularly on the top 10 documents. 4.2 Results and Analysis Table 3 presents the 11-AvgP 
scores. Abbreviations refer to the particular refinement strategies (FM: full match; PM: partial match; 
D: dictionary based and A: simple ad- dition of Spanish/French query words). The FM+D+A refinement strategy 
is the best, achieving 71% and 61% of baseline for Spanish and French respectively . It is not surprising 
that strategy A improves performance since medical terms in Spanish, French and English often have the 
same Latin roots. Table 4 indicates that for the FM+D+A runs, the average interpolated precision at 0.10 
recall, i.e., when 10% of the relevant documents have been retrieved, is 0.3270 (71% of baseline) and 
0.2698 (59% of baseline) for Spanish and French respectively. Table 5 shows that the performance achieved 
within the top 10 ranks is 79% and 51% respectively. Across all measures the performance range achieved 
is 71% to 79% (Spanish) and 51% -61% (French) of monolingual performance. 7Since document and query lengths 
do not vary significantly there is no need to normalize the weights. The A indicates that any remaining 
Spanish/French words were simply added to the final query. For example, there are 98 untranslated Spanish 
query words (81 unique words) out of a total of 538 query words (356 unique words) for the runs represented 
in Table 4 and Table 5. Table 5: Experiment. 1: Exact Precision Scores.    5 Further Exploration 
 The previous experiment did not involve any morphologi- cal normalization with stemmers in the query 
translation process. When we select Spanish/French MeSH terms from the Metathesaurus for the queries, 
exact match cri-teria are employed (see Section 3.5). Unfortunately, there are a number of instances 
where some vocabulary normal-ization may help. For example, the Spanish queries #25 and #30 have the 
word aislado . Although the Metathe- saurus does not contain this word, it contains the mor-phological 
variants aislada , aisladores and aislados . As an alternative to stemming we explore digram based vocabulary 
normalization methods. Digrams are determined prior to the SMART baaed matching process described in 
Section 3.5. The Span-ish/French query is first modified using the digram based method and then sent 
into the SMART procedure to identify appropriate MeSH concept phrases. Thus query words that do not occur 
in the Spanish/French Metathe-saurus are substituted (if possible) by the closest match-ing words based 
on the digrams method. 5.1 Digram Based Matching. Each Metathesaurus Spanish/French word and each query 
word is represented by its set of digrams. Similarity is computed using Dice s Coefficient: Sim(Query 
-word, Meta -word) = 2 * N/(P + Q) (1) where P and Q are the number of digrams in each word and N is 
the number in common. (Note that computed similarity can be greater than one when a digram occurs more 
than once in either word.) We test two selection strategies, with exact matches selected in both. . Q 
: Select a single Metathesaurus word with simi-larity >= 0.8. If this fails, retain the original query 
word. . Q : Apply an additional length constraint where word length equals the number of unique digrams. 
Select all words >= 0.8 similarity within a differ-ence of 1 in word length. This will select aislada 
and aislados for the query word aislado but reject aisladores . Table 6 shows examples of queries transformed 
through both alternatives. Note that stopwords are removed and the query words alphabetized in the transformed 
queries9 Words in the original query which do not appear in the Spanish/French Metathesaurus and are 
therefore candidates for digram based substitution are highlighted as are their substitutions. gSince 
our retrieval tests employ a word based approach, alphabetization has no effect. 77  5.2 Digram Based 
Results The previous CLIR runs were repeated with the differ-ence of including digram based vocabulary 
normalization procedures into the query translation process. All three performance scores for the two 
alternative query formats (Q and Q ) were computed. Similar to the previous ex-periment, the best runs 
are obtained with the FM+D+A combination of refinement strategies for both query types and languages. 
The digram approach, without the addi-tional length constraints, i.e., Q , consistently gives bet- ter 
results comnared to Q . The best result obtained for Spanish is 0.1832 ll-AvgP (75% baseline); 0.3493 
aver-age interpolated precision at 0.1 recall (76% baseline) and 0.2179 exact precision at 10 retrieved 
documents (81% baseline). For French, the corresponding figures are 0.1647 (68%); 0.2935 (64% baseline) 
and 0.1547 (58% baseline) respectively. In comparison with the results of the first experiment, the best 
digram run offers improve- ments in the range of 2 to 5% for Spanish and 5 to 7% for French depending 
upon the measure used. Other nor-malization methods, such as stemming, will be explored in the future. 
 5.3 Comparison of Spanish and French Re-sults In general it is clear that the French results are infe-rior 
to the Spanish results. The question asked at this point is whether the performance differences observed 
is due to their different levels of representation in the UMLS or due to important differences in the 
languages that we are not considering, or perhaps due to both ? We know that of the MeSH concepts, 23,198 
yield a to- tal of 32,282 Spanish strings and 18,277 MeSH concepts yield 25,932 French strings. Interestingly 
except for a single concept, all concepts with French strings also have _ Spanish strings . However, 
4,922 of the MeSH concepts with Spanish strings do not have corresponding French strings. Thus for all 
practical purposes we may consider the French concepts to be a proper subset of the Spanish concepts. 
In order to study the effect of the difference in representation further we first reduced the Spanish 
con-cepts to those 18,276 concepts which were also available in French. We refer to this set as Spanish-reduced 
and use Spanish for the original set of 23,198 Spanish con-cepts. To our surprise, the differences between 
Spanish-reduced and Spanish from the viewpoint of our collection of 106 Spanish queries is minimal. The 
auerv set has 538 words (after excluding stopwords) out ofwhich 82 do not occur in the Spanish concepts 
and only an additional 5 do not occur in Spanish-reduced. Thus we do not expect to see any differences 
in retrieval performance by moving from the set of Spanish concepts to the subset that also has French 
translations12. Thus we may conclude that the difference in the level of representation in the UMLS across 
the two languages does not cause the difference in CLIR performance observed for this query set. Of course 
the assumption bebind this question is that the translations in both languages are of equal quality. 
The one exception is concept COO05403 with t,he French string Reflux Biliare . This expectation was supported 
when we repeated the FM+D+A run of Table 3 on Spanish-reduced. The performance increased slightly to 
0.1745. The slight increase may be explained by the fact that the 5 additional terms without representation 
in Spanish-reduced are of low frequency and are not very informative such as adversos . .Tp.nle Q# Version

French 12 8 22 11 18 35 Table 7: Distribution of query-by-query performance. Table 8: Examples of query 
terms and performance If we assume that the translations are of equal qual- ity then our conclusion is 
that there are important differ-ences in the two languages that our CLIR algorithm has yet to consider. 
This is also indicated by the fact that the addition of the heuristic PM always degrades the French results 
but not the Spanish results. Future work is planned to examine these aspects in further detail. 6 Query-by-Query 
Analysis. For this analysis we took the best performance of the Spanish and French queries and compare 
them against the baseline. We obtain the precision of each of the 106 queries and compute the percentage 
difference with re-spect to the baseline. The queries were grouped in six classes which are presented 
in Table 7. Each cell presents the number of queries in that class. We observe that the translation process 
improves several queries. Surprisingly French queries generate 20 significantly improved trans-lated 
queries, in contrast to 14 generated by the Span-ish queries. We also observe that the Spanish transla-tion 
generates 40 queries that perform equivalently to the baseline. Table 8 shows four of the queries from 
classes 1 and 6. We observe that in query 87 both translations perform significantly better than the 
baseline. In query 105 the Spanish translation is better than baseline but the French translation performs 
very low. The contrary happens in query 44. In those cases where the transla-tion performs better than 
the baseline, the process has introduced a new important term that was not present in the original English 
query. Query 61 is an example of a case where both translations perform worse than the baseline. In those 
cases, the translation process failed to translate an important term of the query. This type of analysis 
will allow us to refine our meth- ods in future research. 7 Conclusions We have explored a CLIR method 
for MEDLINE using only the multilingual Metathesaurus for query transla-tion. No tools such as part of 
speech taggers, stemmers and separate corpora are involved. The approach begins by first selecting an 
initial set of Spanish/French MeSH phrases that is appropriate for the query as a whole. This set is 
then refined using alternative strategies, The best performance is achieved by: first selecting phrases 
that contain only query words; then translating any remain- ing query words on a word-by-word basis; 
and finally re-taining the remaining Spanish/French query words. We tested the translated queries on 
OHSUMED with the monolingual retrieval results as the baseline. Three ver-sions of translated queries 
were tested over two retrieval experiments. The second and third query versions (Q and Q ) involved digram 
based vocabulary normaliza-tion procedures. In general, the best free-text based retrieval perfor-mance 
is at 75% of baseline MLIR performance in ll-AvgP; 76% of baseline in average precision at 0.1 recall 
and 81% baseline in exact precision at 10 retrieved doc-uments for Spanish. French yields less favorable 
results, with best scores 68%, 65% and 58% respectively. We show that these differences in performance 
are not caused by differences in level of representation in the UMLS. The must likely cause is difference 
in linguistic features. When compared with previous results we see that Spanish CLIR using the Metathesaurus 
for query trans-lation is on the high end of the performance range (of 50- 75% of baseline scores) observed 
with approaches based on dictionaries with or without information extracted from corpora 12, 3, 7, 14). 
As anticipated, performance is still behind dictionary independent methods using paral- lel corpora [lo]. 
It remains to be seen if the addition of tools such as stemmers and relevant parallel or compara- ble 
corpora improves performance. In addition to the use of the UMLS Metathesaurus (an excellent example 
of a collaboratively built vocabu-lary system), this study has a number of unique features. First, it 
involves SMART in selecting MeSH phrases for queries which allows us to consider weights in this phase. 
Another unique feature is the exploration of a new and automatic method for deriving word based transfer 
dic-tionaries from phrase based transfer dictionaries. We also show that such dictionaries contribute 
to CLIR perfor-mance. This is also one of very few recent studies to empirically explore the value of 
multilingual thesauri or controlled vocabularies for CLIR. Moreover we investi-gate how a controlled 
vocabulary can be used to conduct free-text based CLIR. Lastly, this research contributes to the strengthening 
of the international impact of MED- LINE. Future work will build on these results by explor- ing alternate 
refinement strategies and appropriate sec-ond language stemmers. We also look forward to explor- ing 
the other languages of the UMLS: Portuguese and German. Acknowledgements The authors thank Professor
