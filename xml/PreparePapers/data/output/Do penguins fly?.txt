 Do Penguins Fly? contact: Sun limet Planktoon sunlimet@hotmail.com www.planktoon.com This series pilot 
introduces an explorer who travels the world to study all kinds of unusual animals and contradicts some 
well-known statements about them in absurd and funny ways. Do Penguins Fly? was a good way to test Planktoon 
s production pipeline and see for ourselves what we could do within only a month. We enjoy the opportunity 
to work together on our projects, using our own methods and benefiting from each other s skills in a 
way that can not be achieved in conventional industry settings. Director Compositing Acknowledgement

for Real-Time Multiple Scattering in Hair contact: Cem Yuksel Texas A&#38;M University cem@cemyuksel.com 
www.cemyuksel.com Multiple scattering of light in the hair volume is an important phenomenon that determines 
visible hair color. Without this multiple scattering component, even blonde hair looks dark and unnatural, 
and faking this component gives the hair a dull appearance. Dual scattering is a novel method that approximates 
multiple scattering in hair based on several physically based theoretical simplifications. The result 
of dual scattering is a real-time estimation of the correct hair appearance under any lighting and viewing 
condition, which is visually identical to the result of an accurate computation using path tracing that 
takes many hours. Production Cem Yuksel Hair Modeling Cem Yuksel Anton Andriyenko Head Model Murat Afsar
