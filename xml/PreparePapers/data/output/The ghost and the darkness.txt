 The Ghost And The Darkness Digital artists seamlessly integrated live-action lions with computer­generated 
elements to add intensity and suspense to the film. The light­ing was digitally altered to allow left/right 
mirroring to correct lion eyelines. The lions color and manes were also digitally altered. Visual Effects
