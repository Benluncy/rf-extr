to provide an interface that serves as the monitor between the user and the hypothetical virtual machine, 
and (3) to provide a simulated environment where students can run machine language programs and trace 
the execution as the programs are being interpreted by the VSEM microprogram. The design of the virtual 
machine reflects a typical machine composed of registers, machine language instruction set, microoperations, 
and microprogram that interprets the machine language programs. A schematic view of the architecture 
for the VS~4 and its monitor is shown in Figure i. The VS~M has an accun~/lator register that is involved 
in all arithmetic operations. Each instruction in the machine language has two 8-bit fields, an operation 
code and a storage address. The VS~M processor has an arithmetic and logic unit for performing certain 
calculations. Although not shown in Figure i, the VS~4 has a separate register for each of the following 
operations: (a) locating the next machine language instruction to be executed, (b) holding the address 
of the location in primary storage being read from or written to, (c) receiving data being read or holding 
data being written, (d) extracting the address portion of the machine instruction in a storage data 
register, (e) pointing to the location of the next microinstruction to be executed, and ( f ) pointing 
to the current microinstruction being executed. The VS~4 machine operates by first loading the microprogram 
into control storage; each instruction in the microprogram resides in one location of control storage. 
The machine fetches the next instruction pointed to by a control storage instruction address register 
 (CSIAR), decodes the instruction and transfers control to the appropriate routine in the microprogram 
to interpret the current microinstruction; the control storage instruction address register is updated 
and the entire process is repeated. Similarly, the microprogram fetches the primary storage address of 
the next machine language instruction pointed to by a primary storage instruction address register (PSIAR), 
interprets the instruction and then updates the primary storage instruction address register. Appendix 
A contains the machine language instruction set for the VSID4. Note that the instruction set and user 
operations are limited; this restriction will facilitate learning of the VSEM language and its architecture. 
The microoperations that the machine can perform are presented in Appendix B. The microoperations are 
combined in sequences to impl~ent the machine language instructions of the VS~4 machine. The microprogram 
which interprets VSEM machine language instruction is also presented in the Appendix B. The microprogrammed 
VS~4 first sets the CSAIR to 0 (i.e the location of the microcode routine that performs a machine language 
fetch instruction). The machine fetches the next machine language instruction from the location whose 
address is in the PSAIR. The GET ~peration causes the instruction to be loaded from memory into the storage 
data register (SDR). The address of the proper microcode routine in control storage for interpreting 
the machine language instruction is decoded from the SDR and copied into the CSIAR. After executing the 
current microinstruction control is transfered to the microcode routine. We have simulated the operations 
of the VS~4 machine to allow us present and demonstrate the concepts of fir~are to senior undergraduate 
students. Though virtual, the VS~M is an emulator of a typical computer machine. The design and implementation 
of the VSI~4 monitor reflects the basic operations of a disk operating system. The functions of the VS~4 
monitor commands are presented in Appendix C; these commands are self-explanatory and will not be described 
further. The BNF syntax structure of the VS~4 monitor commands will be made available to the reader upon 
request.  .......................................................... t t System Message Table Tor

OF A CONCURRENT PASCAL The main objective for the i~pl~mentation of a concurrent PASCAL (PASCAL-AT) 
was to provide an environment for demonstration of problems associated with concurrent execution of processes. 
The PASCAL-AT is a modification of the PASCAL-S interpreter that was originally written by M. Ben-Ari 
[Be82]. The implementation of a PASCAL-AT system is a simulation of concurrent execution. The PASCAL-AT 
system compiles a subset of pascal pseudocode and then simulates the execution of this code; the object 
language pseudocode is simulated on a stack machine. The reader is encouraged to contact the authors 
for further details on the BNF syntax structures and the implementation of the PASCAL-AT system.  4. 
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS During the 1985-86 academic year, the VSEM has been found useful at North Carolina 
A &#38; T State University in introducing the concepts of firmarare. Students were successfully able 
to write VSI~4 machine language programs that add, multiply, and divide (see Appendix D for two exanples 
) the contents of memory locations and to trace the execution. The VSI~4 monitor provided a forum for 
the discussion of the data structures and inrplementation of R0M monitors. Through the simulated PASCAL-AT 
system, students were exposed to many asynchronism problems and their solutions. These problems range 
from one-process and n-process deadlock to indefinite postponement. The systems programming course at 
North Carolina A &#38; T State University emphasizes theory and practice in many areas of computer science: 
operating systems, compilers, assembler languages, linkers and loaders, macroprocessors, editors and 
computer hardware. With these many broad areas it is doubtful that an effective instruction in systems 
programming can be presented to senior undergraduate students without the aids of simulated and emulated 
systems. This claim is based upon the premise that a systems programming course designed for the undergraduate 
students should not be presented as a survey course. Record todate shows that the student performance 
in systems programming course is inproving. It is too early to conclude that the improvement is attributable 
to the newly-developed emulators since the variability of the ability in the group of students in the 
course continues to fluctuate from one semester to another. Nevertheless, we will continue to simulate 
the operations of assemblers, linkers and loaders, and macroprocessors in our future investigation of 
student learning process.  REF~CES [Se82] Ben-At|, M. (1982) Principles of Concurrent Programming, Prentice-Hall
