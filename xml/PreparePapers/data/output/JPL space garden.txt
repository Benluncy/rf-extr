 JPL Space Garden: Space Data Visualization William B. Green The JPL Space Garden features systems in 
current use at JPL for processing and visualization of science data returned by instruments flown on 
various NASA spacecraft: 1 The Science Analysis Graphics Environment (SAGE), a graphical interface used 
to control processing of imaging data returned by solar system exploration spacecraft, including the 
Galileo spacecraft currently returning data from Jupiter. 2 Mission operations support software used 
by the Mars Pathfinder mission that landed on Mars on 4 July 1997, providing stereoscopic mission planning 
tools that support rover navigation on the Martian surface. 3 Animated fly-over sequences produced from 
data of the Earth and other planets. 4 VISTAS, an interactive tool for query/retrieval of earth observations 
data acquired by the TOVS sensor. 5 A prototype of software for processing Atmospheric Infrared Sounder 
(AIRS) data. 6 Internet-accessible image database browsers and navigators that provide public access 
to space mission image archives. 7 Other examples of processing operational data. CONTACT COLLABORATORS
