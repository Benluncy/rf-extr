Hashem (1990) discuss When the simulation point estimator is the sample vari-overlapping batch statistics 
(OB S) to estimate the stan­ance, its standard error can be estimated using batch dard error of general 
point estimators ~ from stationary A variances, which are analogous to batch means for the output processes. 
The OB S estimator of var(()) is, for a standard error of the sample mean. We suggest a given batch size

ending with a conjecture that summarizes various conditions for consistency. In Section 3 we argue for 
modifying the definition of OBV, both to simplify analysis and to im­prove statistical performance. In 
Section 4 we discuss a sequence of conjectures that argue that OBV is con­sistent for lim,,+~ nvar(S2) 
when OBM is consistent for lim,,+x nvar(~). 2 CONSISTENCY OF OBM Under mild conditions, n~M(i71) is an 
rose-consistent es­timator of Iim.+m n var(~); that is, the bias and vari­ance go to zero as n ~ 00. 
Roughly, if the batch-size rule satisfies m ~ ~ and 7z/i7z ~ ~ ,as 77 ~ CO, then lim,t+= mbias[nfi~(m)] 
= - yl 62 and lim ;va@M(m)] = ;(7.02)2 , n 4. where the sum of autocorrelations is .. 70= z ph=l+z~ph 
h=-h=l and the weighted sum of autocorrclalions is and ()/1 = COtT(xi, Xi+h). Damerdji (1991), Pedrosa 
(1994), and Song and Schmeiser (1994) provide various conditions under which these two limits hold. Without 
specifying precise conditions, we combine these results as Conjecture 1. For covariancc-stationary data 
{Xi }, if O c CS2< M, 71 ~< c=, and m and n A71go to infinit y as n + W, then rtVA4(m) is an msc-consistent 
estimator of lim,l+z n var(x). 3 REDEFINING OBV The original definition of OBV has two disadvantages. 
RI-SL the use of 171-1, rather than m, in the definition of the batch variances S? and of n 1, rather 
than n, in the definition of the grand variance S2 complicates analysis with essentially no statistical 
benefit, because simulation batch sizes and run lengths are typically quite big. The usual purpose obtaining 
an unbiased estimator is not compelling, because the nonzero autocorrelations cause some bias and because 
the smaller mean squared error (rose) obtained by using the sample size is appeal­ing (Ceyl,an and Schmeiser 
1993). Sccoml, statistical performance and analysis tractabili­ty are improved by using the grand sample 
mean ~rath­er than the batch sample means ~j in the definition of Sj; that is, now and 2= + ~(xi X)2 
. i The grand sample mean is available and is a better esti­mator of p than the batch mean. Computation 
is still possible in O(n) time. 4 CONSISTENCY OF OBV Using the new definition of OBV, we now propose 
a conjecture that says that OBV works under conditions similar to those needed for OBM. Let ad denote 
E[((Xi p)/~)4], the fourth st.~d~d moment of Xi. Conjecture 2. For covariance-stationary data {Xi }, 
if 0eG2<~,l<Q<~,y1e@,mdm andnh go to infinity as n + ~, then ntiv(rn) is an msc­consistent estimator 
of lim,t+m nVar(S2). Conjecture 2 adds only the requirement that the fourth moment be finite and greater 
than one. For @ = 1, the data are binary, which causes var(S2) = O (n 2) rather than O (u-l) (Ceylan 
and Schmeiser 1993). The argument for Conjecture 2 rests on viewing OBV as an applica[iou of OBM to the 
data process of squared deviations from the sample mean. Wood and Schmeiser Result 3. OBV applied to 
the data process {Xi} is alge­braically equivalent to OBM applied to the data pro­cess { (Xi-2)2}. The 
proof is trivial because under the new definition the sample batch variances S? ~d the s~Ple v~ance S2 
are sample averages of the squared deviations from the sample mean. Because of Result 3, OBV is consistent 
for {Xi} if and only if OBM applied to the squared-deviations pro­cess is consistent. Let tildes on process 
propertie -i denote the squared-deviations process; for example, a is the variance of (Xi -1)2. Conjecture 
4. Fo~2 covariance-stationary data {(Xi -~)2}, if0<0 <~,~1 <~,~dm~dn/m go to infinity as n ~ M, then 
nVv(nl) is an mse­consistent estimator of limn+-rtv@2). Result 5 and Conjecture 6 provide the two conditions 
needed for Conjecture 4 to be applicable: that the squared-deviations process is covariance stationary 
and that the weighted sum of autocol~elations ~1 is finite. Let fi4 be the fourth standard moment of 
~, which asymptotically has the value three if ~ is asymptotically normal. Result 5. Assume that YI, 
cx4, and @ are finite. The squared-deviations process { (Xi X)2} is asymptoti­cally covariance stationmy 
if the original data process {Xi } is covariance stationary. That is, 5(tz) ~i~E[(Xi _ %)2] = E[(Xi _ 
j.t)2] = ~2 , S(b) lim Var[(Xi -1)2]= var[(Xi -)t)2] n+. =(a4 1)04 , and 5(C) ~~~COV[(Xi X)2, (Xi+~ 
 X)2] = COV[(Xi -~)2, (Xi+h -~)2] , h = 1,2,..., independent of i. The proof of Result 5, which is not 
given here, con­sists of expanding terms and taking expected values. Conjecture 6 says that the squared-deviations 
process has sufficient mixing if the original data process mixes sufticicnll y. Conjecture 6. If yl < 
~, then ~1 < ~. The argument for Conjecture 6 consists of examples where the result holds, and the lack 
of a counterexample. For processes with normal marginal distributions, ~~ =P1 and therefore O < l~h] 
< lp~l for h = 1,2,... (Patel and Read 1982). In the appendix we show that the conjecture holds for first-order 
moving-average processes with arbitrary marginal distributions on the er­ror terms. Monte Carlo simulation 
results are consistent with the conjecture for steady-state M\M/l queue wait­ing time processes. Numerical 
integration results indi­ cate that Ipi < Ipl for bivariate lognormal data. We have no coun(erexCample 
for I ~~ I < I p~ I, 5 SUMMARY Via a sequence of six results and conjectures, we have argued that using 
OBV to estimate the standard error of the sample variance is reasonable whenever using OBM to estimate 
the standard error of the sample mean is rea­sonable. The argument is quite heuristic, based on view­ing 
the mrnple variance as a sample mean. (See also Pri­estley 1992, p. 321.) It nevertheless adds confidence 
to our empirical experience. The only counterexample, symmetric binary marginal distributions, is pathological 
and easy to identify in practice. The points made here about OBV estimators seem Iikel y to be relevant 
to the more general OB S estimators. Gmnd point estimates should be used where possible. For OBS estimators 
where the point estimator can be viewed as a sample me<an of a related process, applica­tion seems likely 
to work well. In addition, the ideas of this paper also apply to other batching estimators (Song and 
Schmeiser 1993). ApP~N1]l~ We show here that Conjecture 6, that Y1 finite implies ~1 finile, holds for 
the steady-state MA(1) process Xi=&#38;i+a&#38;i_l , where the error terms { Ei } are imlependcnt with 
zero mean, variance c:, and fourth standardized moment @. Consistency of Overlapping Because p~ = ~~
