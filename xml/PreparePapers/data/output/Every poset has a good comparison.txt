 Every Poset Has a Good Comparison i. 2. Jeff Kahn I'2 and Michael Saks 2 Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Cambridge, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J. 08903 ~. 02139 ABSTRACT We show that 
any finite partially ordered set P contains a pair of elements x and y such that the proportion of linear 
extensions of P in which x lies be- low y is between 3/11 and 8/11. A conse- quence is that the information-theoretic 
lower bound for sorting under partial in- formation is tight up to a multiplicative constant. Precisely: 
if X is a totally ordered set about which we are given some partial information, and if e(X) is the number 
of total orderings of X compatible with this partial information, then it is possible to sort X using 
no more than c log2e(X) comparisons (c~2.17). I. Introduction Suppose we wish to sort a totally ordered 
(finite) set X concerning whose ordering we are given partial information in the form of certain relations 
x<y (with x,y £ X). As usual the basic step is a comparison of two elements of X, and the question which 
immediately presents it- self is, how many such comparisons are required in worst case? In the language 
of partially ordered sets (posets) : the transitive closure of the given set of relations is a partial 
order, say R, on X, and our task is to discover which of the various linear extensions of R -i.e. R-respecting 
total orderings of X -is the true one. Supported in part by NSF Grant MCS83-01867 Permission to.copy

$00.75 299 Notice that after a sequence of compari- sons we are again confronted with a problem of the 
same type, the partial order in question being simply the tran- sitive closure of the set of relations 
known to date. If this current partial order is R', then a new comparison, say of x and y, leaves either 
the set of linear extensions of R' in which x pre- cedes y or the (complementary) set in which y precedes 
x . As it is possible that each comparison leaves the larger of the two sets, we find that sorting re- 
auires at least logqe(R) comparisons in worst case, where e(R) is the number of linear extensions of 
R. This is the information theoretic lower bound. Of course matters could be much worse, since for 
x,y chosen at random it will often be the case that there are far more linear extensions in which x pre- 
cedes y than vice versa (or vice versa). But if for some fixed positive 6 we are always able to choose 
x and y so that the fraction p(x<y) of linear extensions in which x precedes y is between ~ and i-~, 
then sorting is accomplished with at most lOgl/(l_6~e(R)_, comparisons. Thus the problem of sorting 
under partial in- formation leads naturally to the Question: Is there a constant 6 e (0,1/2) such that 
every finite poset that is not a chain (total order has a pair of elements x,y such that 6 < p(x<y) < 
1-6? It was apparently first conjectured by M. Fredman, circa 1975, that the answer to this question 
is yes and that 6 can be taken to be 1/3. (This conjecture was posed independently by N. Linial [L], 
from whom we first heard it. That 6 = 1/3 is best possible is shown by the poset with three elements 
and a single relation.) Here we prove Theorem i. Every finite partially ordered set that is not totally 
ordered contains a pair of elements x and y such that 3/11 < p(x<y) < 8/11. As already indicated, this 
gives the de- sired upper bound. Theorem 2. The general problem of sorting a poset P can be solved using 
at most lOgll/8e(P) = 2.2 log2e(P) compari- sons. Thus the information theoretic lower bound is tight 
up to a multiplica- tive constant. We remark that Fredman [F] proves the existence of an algorithm 
for sorting P using at most log2e(P) + 21p I comparisons. Remark: Although we have not been able to 
significantly improve the value of 6 in Theorem i, we certainly believe that Fredman's conjecture is 
correct. In fact it seems that one can say more. For w e Nq let us define 6(w) as the maximum 6 such 
that every poset of width at least w contains x,y with 6~p(x<y)~l-6. (Recall that the width of a poset 
P is just the maximum size of a set of pair- wise incomparable elements of P.) Then we would venture 
 Conjecture. Zim 6(w) = 1/2 W+~ In particular we expect that 6(3)>1/3, which, since 6=1/3 is known 
to be cor- rect for posets of width 2 (see [L]), would say that there is actually a bit of slack available 
in Fredman's con- jecture. 2. Outline of the proof of Theorem i. We regard a linear extension of a 
poset P as an order preserving bijection q: P÷{l .....n} (where n=[Pl) , and write E(P) for the set 
of all such extensions (so e(P)=IE(P ) ]) . Our aim is to show the existence of a pair of elements x 
and y such that p(x<y) is between 3/11 and 8/11. How do we get our hands on this pair? For xeP, let h(x) 
denote the average of o(x) over all extensions of p , i h(x) = e~ Z o(x). qeE(P) Clearly 1 < h(x) 
< IPI for all xeP. Moreover, since--we can--assume P has no element which is comparable to every other 
element (such elements are irrelevant and can be deleted), these inequalities are strict. Thus there 
exists a pair of ele- ments x and y such that lh(y)-h(x) I<l. This pair must be incomparable (since h(y)-h(x), 
which equals the average of ~(y)-o(x), is ~ 1 if y~x). What we will show is Theorem 3. Any pair of elements 
 x,yeP satisfying h(y)-h(x)<l also satisfies p(x<y) < 8/11. Thus a pair x,y for which lh(y)-h(x) I<i 
will satisfy the conditions of Theorem I. To establish the connection between the quantities h(y)-h(x) 
and p(x<y), we define Pk(X<y), for any integer k, to be the proportion of linear extensions of P in which 
~(y)-o(x) = k (so e.g. Pk(X<y) = p_k(Y<X)). Then p(x<y) = Z Pk(X<y), k>l h(y) -h(x) = Z kPk(X<y) , 
kern and we may restate Theorem 3 as Theorem 3'. If Z kPk(X<y) < i, keg then Z Pk(X<y) < 8/11. k>l 
 Let us write Pk for Pk(X<y). To gain some intuition regarding Theorem 3', let Z be the random variable 
defined by Prob(Z=k) = Pk" Then Theorem 3' deduces an upper bound on Prob(ZeKN) from an upper bound 
on E(Z). Of course no such result holds for arbitrary sequences (pk) (e.g. take p_n=i/n, Pl=l-I/n); 
the proof of Theorem 3' consists essentially of establishing the following special properties of the 
sequences (pk=Pk(X<y)). 300 (1) Z Pk = 1 ken  (2) P0 = 0  (3) P-i = Pl  (4) P2 + P-2 ! Pl + P-i 
 (5) Pk ! Pk-i + Pk+l if Ikl ~ 2  (6) p~ ~ Pk_iPk+ 1 if Ikl ~ 2  In fact it can be Shown(though, 
as far as we know, not without a good deal of work) that any sequence satisfying (1)-(6) also satisfies 
Theorem 3' Of the six properties listed above, the first three are trivial, the fourth is easy, and 
the fifth, while less easy, may at least be arrived at in an ele- mentary fashion. The last property 
is more interesting. Its proof depends on the Aleksandrov-Fenchel Inequalities from the theory of mixed 
volumes, exploiting a connection discovered by R. Stanley [S]. While we will not give a proof of (6) 
here, we would at least like to indicate what machinery is involved. If K 0 and K 1 are convex bodies 
in ~n we write K 1 for the convex body (l-l)K0+IKl={(l-l)v0+IVllV0eK0,Vl~Kl }. The seminal result 
is due to Minkowski (see [BE]) : Theorem. The n-dimensional volume of K t is a homogeneous polynomial 
of de-gree n in X, n n V(Kx) = ~ (k)Vk(K0,Ki)xk(i-I) n-k k=0 The coefficients Vk(K0,K I) are the mixed 
 volumes of K 0 and K I. Their importance for us is due to the Aleksandrov-Fenchel Inequalities. The 
sequence V0(K0,Ki),...,Vn(K0,Ki) is logarithmically concave (i.e. for 0<k<n, Vk(K0,K I) ~ Vk_i(K0,Ki)Vk+i(K0,Ki 
))- For further references and some indication of a proof of this result see [B]. The proof of (6) 
above is accom- plished by realizing the sequence (Pk(X<Y))k>0 essentially as the mixed volumes of--an 
appropriately chosen pair of polytopes. Details of the proof out- lined in this section will appear in 
the journal Order. REFERENCES [B] H. Busemann, Convex Surfaces, Inter- science, New York, 1958. [BF]
