KEYWORDS: GIS, topological relations, spatial objects, fuzzy geographic regions, fuzzy sets ABSTRACT 
The clevelolmmnt of formal models of spatial rela- tions is a topic of great importance in spatial rea-soning, 
geographic information systems (GIS) and computer vision, and has gained nmch attention from researchers 
across these disciplines during the past two decades or so. In recent years significant achievements 
have been rnade on the developnmnt of models of spatial relations between spatial objects with precisely, 
defined boundaries. However. these models catmot be directly applied to spatial objects with indeterminate 
boundaries which are found in many al)plications in geographic analysis and im-age understanding. This 
pal)er develops a method for approxinmtely analyzing binary topological re-lations I)~,tween spatial 
objects with indeterminate bomldaries based upon previous work on topological spatial relations anti 
fuzzy sets. It is shown that tile eight topological relations between two regions in a two-dimensional 
space can be easily deternfined by the method. 1 INTRODUCTION The developnmnt of general theories of 
spatial relations has received much attention [br more than two decades in the literature of artili-cial 
intelligence, eontputer vision, GIS and image "'Permission to makc digital or hard copies of part or

[12, 1, 16]. Up to date, significant achievements have been made in the development of models of metrtcal 
spatial relations [18, 11], math- ematical models of topological relations [9, 5], and the cognitive 
aspects of these models [15]. However, reported research on theories of spatial relations thus far have 
mainly concentrated on spatial rela-tions of objects with precisely defined boundaries (hereafter called 
cr-isp regions). In ninny areas of ge- ographic data handling, particularly in the manage- ment of natural 
resource data, spatial objects tend to have indeterminate boundaries [3}. These objects with indeterminate 
boundaries are called fuzzy re-gions in this paper. In the GIS community there has been a wide recognition 
of the exhibition of fltzziness in geographic data and a general consensus that current GIS are not capable 
of handling fuzzy geographic data directly (see. e.g.. [3]. ['22]. and the relerences therein). Although 
there have been con-siderable research efforts concerned with the han-dling of fuzzy geographic data 
in the literature of spatial analysis [14] and GIS [22]. only very few re- search efforts have been devoted 
to the ctevelopment of theories of spatial relations concerning fuzzy re-gions [4. (5]. This paper ctevelops 
a method for approximately an- alyzing binary topological relations between fuzzy regions without holes. 
The method is built |lpon fuzzv set theory and existing models of spatial rela- tions, particularly the 
9-Intersection model of I)imuy topological relations between crisp objects [9]. \Ve will exclusively 
focus on the eight billary topologi- cal relations between regions ~us distinguished by the 9-intersection 
model [10]. In the [bllowing, we will first review previous work related to spatial relations between 
fuzzy regions ancl the 9-intersection model of binary topological relations between regions in Section 
2. We then proceed to discuss how a fuzzy 192 region can be formally represented in Section 3. A method 
for determining binary topological relations between fuzzy regions is presented in Section 4. and finally, 
conclusions are drawn in Sect.ion 5. RELATED WORK Two lines of research are closely related to the topic 
of this paper: 1) the representation of fuzzy re-gions and tile analysis of directional spatial relations 
between fuzzy Legions and 2) the development of binary topological relations between crisp regions. Rosenfeld 
[19, 20] is among the first to recognize the potential of fuzzy set theory in processing digi- tal image 
data. Since then, a number of researchers have defined many terms related to tile geomet-ric and topological 
properties of fuzzy image data (see, e.g., [71 and [17]). Freeman [121 t'ecognized the al)proximate (fuzzy) 
nature ()f spatial relations among spatial objects, and suggested that these spa- tim relations be described 
in an approxinlate frame- work. Rosenfeld [19] and Rosenfeld and Klette [21] have defined spatial relations 
such as "'adjacency" and "surrottndedness" between fuzzy image regions. Dubois and Jaulent [71 extended 
1Rosenfeld's work t/lid developed a general model of spatial relations between two fuzzy objects. Recently. 
1,2rishuatm-ram ca al. [13] develol)ed methods tbr quantitatively analyzing the directional relations 
between fuzzy re- gions..More recently, Clementini and Di Felice [4] and Cohn and Gotts [6] have developed 
models of topoh)gical relations between fltzzy regions fl'om dif- tbrent l)erspectives. Their models, 
however, treat the indeterminate botnl(larv of a fuzzy region as a thick botmdary. As a consequence, 
finer distim'- lions l)etween points (pixels) lying within the thirty l)()uudarv can not be made in these 
m<)dels. Topological relations between spatial ()l)je('ts are the spatial relations that are invariant 
tllt<l(,t tOl)<)h)~-i<'al transformations such as rotation, s('aling and translation. A model for al131.yzing; 
binary top<>log- i('al relations has been developed in the literature [10]. This model is called the 
9-i'n.tcrscctior, model+ In this model, a spatial object is decompt)sed into three parts: an i'nte?'iov, 
a bo~m.darfl and au e.rt#dor. For two ('ris I) ob.jects +4 and /3. their top()h~gical r<'- lati(ms can 
be determined by the interse('ti<)ns of the in.b'Hor, bouruhu'p and extel'ior of the two objects. There 
are a total of nine intersections alnollg the six parts of two objects. Depending on the values~f the 
intersections, which can either be empty or non- empty, a total of 512 (2 '°) possible combinations of 
topological relations can be distinguished between two spatial objects. In two-dimensional space, eight 
binary topological relations between spatial regions without holes can be distinguished [10]. \Vhile 
the 9-intersection model is an elegant framework fl)r modeling binary and composite topological relations 
among spatial regions [8], the model cannot be di- rectly used to model topological relations between 
fllzzy regions. Fortunately, as will be shown in the following sections, tile eight binary topological 
re-lations between fuzzy regions can be easily deter-mined bv extending the work of Dubois and Jaulent 
[7]. Betbre we discuss binary topological relations between fuzzy regions, a formal definition of fuzzy 
regions is in order. 3 THE REPRESENTATION OF A FUZZY REGION A fuzzy region can be decomposed into three 
parts: 1) the (:ore, 2) the indeterminate boundary and 3) tile exterior. The indeterminate boundary can 
be further (lecoml)osed into an inside boundary, an out- side boundary and tile area bound by the inside 
and outside boundaries. '['hese concepts are defined fin'-main below. Suppose that 9, is a referential 
set of a finite nuntber of attributes in a domain under con-sideration, and that each geographic fuzzy 
region R is defined over 9.. Tile membershit) function of R can bedefined as: lq¢ : X x Y x 9+--, [0,11 
. Each point (.r..q) within the region is assigned a member- ship vahle for attribute ~,,: u,?(x,!l.a:). 
~ E ~).. We shall denote A(R)= {(,,:.g,~)t(I < HR(a',g,o,') < 1} +us the indeterminate boundary of R, 
o(R) = {(,r,!l.-:)',ILf~(.r,!l.~') = l} as the core of R, and @(/?) = {(.c. !],~,')lltR(.c. !2,~') = 
1/} as the outside bolmdarv of/?. with respect to attribute ~,'. "['he in- side boundary o(R) is the 
intersection of A('R) and *(/~). Th(, underlying assumption behind this deft- nitiou is that the membership 
values ()f tit<, pixels of a fuzzy region R, increase from the outside bound-art to its core. This assumption 
can be justified in many geographic al)ptications It4]. It is faMv easy to realize that there is still 
(:(msid- erable information loss in the above representation because ()ulv inside and outside boundaries 
are dis-tinguished. The dill'ere.me in the membership val-u('s (>f the points (pixels) within the in(leternfinat(" 
b(mn(larv is not represented in the above definit, ion. 193 In order to make a finer distinction, the 
concept of a-cut level sets [23] can be used to represent a region R ~, such that: R ~ = {(.~.y,,w)luR(,~.,y.w 
) >_ ~}. Clearly, R ~ is a region whose boundary is defined hy all points (pixels) with membership values 
= o:. We shall call R a a o:-cut level region. Because we are only concerned with regions with- out holes 
in this discussion, we further restrict the above assumption. \Ve assume that the increase in the membership 
values of the pixels of a fuzzy region .g from the outside boundary to its core is mono- tonic. Based 
on the definition of a fuzzy region given above and the assumption, ~-cut level regions pos- sess the 
following two important properties: 1) All c~-cut level regions are crisp regions without holes, and 
2) The c~-cut level regions of a fuzzy region are nested. The second property implies that, for mem- 
bership values 1 = ~t > G.2 > ... > ~.~ > ~,~+, = 0, one has R ~' _D R ~ _D ... _D R '~'' _D R .... ~. 
Clearly a c~-cut level set can either be an image region con-sisting of pixels or a polygon whose boundary 
is defined bv a sequence of points corresponding to pixels with membership values = c.t. One of the advantages 
of using o:-(:ut level sets to represent fuzzy regions is that existing data structures and algorithms, 
whether they are vector-l)ased or raster- based, can be applied to a respective region repre- sented 
by a a'-cut level set,. The remaining question is how to aggregate the (~- cut level regions and use 
the aggregated measure-ments to deternfine ])inary topological spatial rela- tions hetween fuzzy regions. 
In order to do so. the concept of I)asic prolml)ility assignment [7] is used. A basic l)robal)ility assignment 
m(R ~') can be at-tached to each ~-cut level region R"'. Here. m(R ~' ) (:an I)e interpreted as the probal)ility 
that R a' is the "true' rel)resentative of R. The value of m(R ~' ) can be determined using equation 
(1) as shown I)elow It}. It can be l)roven that E'n(R"') = 1 [17]. - m(R ~') = ai ai+~ (1)  BINARY TOPOLOGICAL 
RELATIONS BETWEEN FUZZY REGIONS The eight I)inary topological telations between two fuzzy regions as 
distinguished bv the 9-intersection model are: 1) disjoint. 2) contains. 3) inside, 4) equal, 5) meet, 
6) covers. 7) coveredby, and 8) over'-lap. Let T(RI. R2) denote the membership value of topological relation 
between two fuzzy regions R~ and R2, let n denote the number of G-cut level regions, and let T(R{~ ', 
R._~') denote the meml)er-ship value of topological relations l)etween two (,- cut level regions R~' 
and R~'. Based on Dubois and Jaulent ([7], p. 256). the general relations of two fuzzy regions Rt and 
R~ can be determined by: Iz ~t T(R~, R~) = ~ ~ ,,,(r{"'),.(R ~', >(R?', R::') (~) i=I j=t Combining 
(1) and (2), one has: ~t 7~  Z Z( R;,) i=l j=l (3) Equation (3) is applicable to a general case. Because 
a n-cut level region R `~' represents a crisp region, r(R~i ~', R~ ~') can he determined by computing 
the relations between two crisp regions R~ ~ and R~'. "Ellis (:all be achieved using existing algorithms 
ap- plicable to crisp regions (polygons). The aggregated topological relations r(Rt, R2) between two 
regions RL and R,_, then can be determined using equation (:~). It is now possible to determine the eight 
binary topological relations using equation (3). \Ve onh" l)resent formulations for determining three

of spatial relations between sl)atial objects has gained increasing popularity in the lit- erature in 
G[S, computer vision, image mtderstand- ing and robotics. Indeed. there has been a burst ,)t lmblished 
materials on the topic in recent years. S{) far. models of spatial relations have been ntaiuly concerned

these o:-cut level regions. Tol)ological relations between fuzzy regi{ms are then determined bs: aggregating 
the topological relations between corresponding o.-cut level regions. It turns out that the eight binary 
topological re-lations between fuzzy spatial regions without holes ('an be easily determined using the 
method devel-oped in this paper.  Acknowledgment The support of a faculty research enhancement grant
