be a powerful method for significantly increasing the efficiency of estimates of the probability of rare 
events obtained from simulation experiments. However the conditions under which it will be effective 
require careful checking if the method is to be reliably employed. We show that it is easy to get spurious 
answers which are apparently accurate when they are in fact quite wrong. For simple queues, there is 
a simple criterion which guarantees the effective implementation of the method: simply switch the arrival 
and service rates. This result can be shown using a theorem due to Chernoff, however here we show why 
~he method works by examining sample paths directly, and in particular derive the variance reduction 
so obtained. In practice the variance reduction can be several orders of magnitude and we give numerical 
examples demonstrating this. Keywords: Importance Sampling, Variance Reduction. 1 INTRODUCTION We consider 
the estimation of the probability of occurrence of a certain type of rare event. A typical example is 
the gambler s ruin problem where starting with one unit of money, say, we wish to find the probability 
that the gambler can build up his/her winnings to a certain level A without going bankrupt beforehand. 
In the terminology of random walks this is the probability that starting at level 1, the level A will 
be reached before level O. A continuous version of essentially the same problem occurs in the single­ 
server queue if we wish to estimate the probability that during a server busy period the level in the 
queue will reach A, before the busy period ends. Other versions of the problem occur in sequential statistical 
tests. Importance sampling is known to be a powerful technique for estimating such probabilities. It 
was introduced by Siegmund (1976) for Ihandling sequential statistical tests, see also Ripley (1987) 
and Ross (1990), for some simple examples. An engineering viewpoint for queueing problems is given by 
Cottrell et al (1983). Fishman (1993) gives full discussion including the above busy period problem. 
An interesting approach is given by Walrand (1988 a,b) who uses Chernoffs Theorem (Chernoff, 1952) to 
estimate probabilities of certain sample paths occurring. Below we show how a more direct argument, that 
does not require Chernoffs Theorem, can give a sharper insight into how importance sampling can be effectively 
carried out. Our approach enables the variance reduction obtained to calculated. We also show how to 
avoid a certain pitfall that can occur when the probability estimate and estimate of its variability 
are both seriously biased, so that one may be led into thinking that accurate estimation is taking place 
when exactly the opposite is the case. In the next section we describe the basic importance sampling 
technique and give an elementary prototype example. In Sections 3 and 4 we analyse the gambler s ruin 
problem and the busy period problem, and show that the optimal method is to essentially switch the arrival 
and service rates, thereby simulating an unstable queue. Our results are illustrated throughout the paper 
by numerical examples. 317 2 IMPORTANCE SAMPLING OF RARE EVENTS 2.1 The General Method The basic method 
is very simple. We consider terminating processes only. We make a simulation and record if the rare event 
of interest, call it E say, has occurred or not. Note that the run will follow the process to termination 
only if E does not occur. The run can stop once E occurs. Simulation runs are thus Bernoulli trials. 
Let (o denote a typical realization of the process and define T(o) = 1if E occurs in @ = O otherwise 
(2.1) Let dF(a)) denote the probability of occurrence of co. Clearly the probability of occurrence of 
E, Pr(E) is given by Pr(E) = EIT(0)] = ~T(0)dF(to) = CL say, This can be estimated by making N runs and 
taking the sample average, ~, of the observed Ts as the estimator. In importance sampling we simulate 
the process where the sample space Sl remains the same but where the probability of occurrence of OJ 
is dF*(co), this being different from dF(co). We call this the modijied process. Then, provided dF*(co) 
> 0 whenever dF(co) >0, the likelihood ratio (2.2) remains bounded and dF(w) E*(L(w)T(w))= dF*(@) T(to)dF*(w)= 
E(T(w)). ~ (2.3) We can thus estimate u by simulating the modified process N times and recording: Yi 
= L((i)i)T(~i), i=l,..., N. (2.4) ~, the sample average of the Y s estimates ct. The key trick is to 
be able to select dF*(co) so that and Traylor L(w) <1 whenever T(co) = 1. (2.5) Then E*[L2((0)T2(0))] 
< E*[L(to)T2(co)l = E[T2(to)], (2.6) where E* denotes expectation with respect to dF*; combined with 
(2.3) this shows that var(~) < var(~) (2.7) so that variance reduction is achieved. 2.2 A Prototype 
Example We illustrate the method with an elementary example. Let S be a binomial random variable, Bin(n,p), 
and suppose we wish to find Pr(S2a) = cx (2.8) where a is large. It will be convenient to write a = 9n, 
with 9 close to unity. In this example u can be calculated explicitly of course, but for illustration 
we consider its estimation by sampling experiment. We can generate S as the sum of n Bernoulli (p) random 
variables: s=x~+xz+... +xn. (2.9) and from (2. 1) define T(co)=lif S2a = O otherwise The average ~ of 
N such values estimates ct. We have that var(~) = tx(l cx)/ N. (2.10) If importance sampling is used, 
we generate the Xi s as Bernoulli (p*), rather than Bernoulli (p) variates, and estimate u by Y, with 
Y as defined in (2.4). Now in this case (2.2) can be written as p (l-p)n-s L(s) = (2.11) p (l p )n-s 
where s is the observed value of S; and the statistic (2.4) becomes Simulation of Rare Queueing Events 
by Switching Arrival and Service Rates 319 Y= Lif S2a, Y=O otherwise. (2. 12) Var(Y) = O[R2 (Q)]. (2.17) 
For variance reduction to occur, (2.5) has to be Table 1 summarizes the results of 10,000 satisfied. 
Now, if p* > p , then L(s) as defined in experiments in each of which p = 0.7, n = 100. Four (2. 11) 
decreases ass increases. Thus values of 0 were tried, 8 = 0.8, 0.9, .95, and 0.99. It will be seen from 
the tabulated values of R(@) that the variance reduction achieved is much in accordance with (2. 17).

side is Our next example bridges the gap between simple p*=a/n=O. (2.14) cases where alternative methods, 
including theoretical analysis, would normally be preferred to importance Variance reduction is thus 
guaranteed if this sampling and genuine cases for which importance minimized right hand side is less 
than unity. Under sampling is the method of choice but where it is not so obvious how best to implement 
the method. Thethe right circumstances the variance reduction is big. random walk example is simple enough 
for theoretical results to be available for comparison purposes, yet For instance suppose p is small 
and 6 = 1-3 is close to unity so that 5 is small. Then R(@ <<1 and contains the essential difficulties

without first reaching h((3)=sup[at -logM(t)]; O, given its position is 1 at time O]. t>o and Thus the 
straight sampling method comprises generating paths starting at X = 1 at time t = O and noting if the 
level A is reached first or if the level O is M(t) = (l p)+pet. reached first. We use the notation of 
Section 2.1 with w denoting a typical path, and E denoting the event A little calculation shows that 
this is equivalent to that level A is reached first. CX=OIR(())] asn+ CO. [2.17) If importance sampling 
is used we replace (3.1) by the modified transition probabilities Combined with (2. 15) this shows that 
 p*, q*, r*=l-p* -q* (3.3) and compensate using (2.4) instead of (2.1). For simplicity we consider only 
the case where r = r* so that p*+q*=p+q. (3.4) Again the key is to ensure that (2.5) is satisfied. Consider 
any path (o starting from 1 which reaches level A before it reaches O. Its associated probability is 
(3.5) dF(rJ3) = pA-l+b qb rc for some b, c 20. Thus (2.2) becomes (o)= (:r- +b(%) 3 ) (as r = r*). If 
we write p = p/(p+q), q = q/(p+q), P * = p*/(p*+q*)~ q* = q*/(p*+q*) then (3.7) To satisfy (2.5) we 
must have (3.8) P ~ P* ~ (1-P ). A possible choice is p* = q* = ~ (i.e. p*= q* = (p+q)/2), (3.9) but 
the most interesting choice is (3.10) p* =q q* =P(i.e. P* =q,q* =P) when () A-1 L(m) = ~ . (3.11) q 
Then  E*[L (~)T2(~)l= (:~- E[T2(~)l Now it is known (see Cox and Miller, 1978, for example) that 
(x = EIT(co)] = E[T2 (CO)] = pA l(q p)/(q A pA). Thus for A large we find Var(T) = (p/q)A(qp-l-l) whilst 
Var(Y) = (p/q)AVar(T). and Traylor Table 2 gives the simulation results of 10,000 runs with p = 0.3, 
q = 0.5, A = 15, which illustrates the variance reduction achieved. Note that the run time for the modified 
process is longer but this increase is small compared with the variance reduction achieved. A warning 
should be noted. If in our example we let p* > (l-p), this will decrease L(w) for paths co in which dF(ro), 
as given by (3.5), has b small, and in consequence reduce the contribution of such paths to Var(Y). This 
is at the expense of increasing L(co) for paths where b is large, thus increasing their contribution 
to Var(Y). The net effect is to reduce Var(Y) if p* is suitably chosen. The effectiveness of a chosen 
p* will thus require an accurate estimate of Var(Y). An unbiased estimate of Var(Y) will require both 
types of path to be sampled in proportion to their probability of occurrence. Now increasing p* has the 
additional effect of reducing the number of paths where b is large, and if p* is chosen inordinately 
large, then there will be very few such paths. If the sample size is small we may not sample such paths 
at all and their very large contribution to Var(Y) will not be properly accounted for. This makes Var(Y) 
negatively biased and will mislead us into thinking that the estimate of E(Y) is much more accurate than 
it is. This effect is illustrated in Table 2. 4 M/M/l QUEUE Our final example is a simple but non-trivial 
application of the results of Section 3 to the M/hI/l queue, with arrival rate A and service rate p. 
Consider estimation of a = Pr{ queue level reaches A during a busy period of the server}. (4.1) We use 
the methodology of Section 2.1 and simulate a modified M/M/l process with L* and p* set differently from 
~ and p,. We adjust for this by using Y of (2.4) to estimate ct. Wah-and (1988) has considered this problem 
using Chernoff s theorem but we use a simpler, more direct approach. We utilize the analysis given for 
the random walk. A path (I) where the queue level reaches A before it reaches O must reach A at some 
time z. If there are m departures in this time, then this must be matched by precisely A+m-1 arrivals 
in the same time period. If ti are the interarrival times and s. are the service times, J then we have

Z ~ ct-cx2. z i=l w and, because the server is busy over the entire period, Table 3 gives results analogous 
to those in Table 2 for the random walk case and again they corroborate the m m+l analysis given above, 
showing that the method can be Sj <T< Sj very effective. xx j=l j=l  5 CONCLUSIONS Thus ~s j and T are 
nearly equal and we have z Importance sampling allows the probability of rare events to be accurately 
estimated. In certain queueing dF((o) = kA+m-l e-k ~me-W~. (4.2) situations an attractive method is to 
simply swap round the arrival and service rates. Variance It follows that in the case of importance sampling: 
reduction is not only guaranteed, but the method is robust, and variance reduction of orders of magnitude 
can be achieved. L(@,=(*~- (*~e(x*-k+,*-p). The approach is capable of some generalization both in terms 
of extensions of the methodology itself (4.3) and to applications involving more complicated queueing 
situations. A possible generalization is to If we let A * + p* = A+ I-L, the analysis reduces to the 
consider situations where variance reduction is random walk case. Variance reduction is obtained if achieved 
by considering all pairs of states i, j and simply swapping over the transition probability of going 
from state i to j with that of going from j to i. For example, suppose the states of the system can be 
ordered and denoted as 0,1,2,. . . and that transitions only occur from i to i+ 1 with probability Ii 
and from or more interestingly if i+l to i with probability Pi,, The M/M/l queue is the special instance 
where Li = k, Pi = p, and the well­ when known repairman problem can be formulated with ki A 1 = ik, 
pi = L. Then the method in effect makes the L(o)) = f . (4.6) swap ki = I-L, WI = 1 for the M/M/l model. 
A similar () exchange is possible in the repairman problem by setting ~i = p, Pi = ik. We hope to address 
these extensions elsewhere. In this latter case Table 1: Estimation of u = Pr(S 2 On) from 10,000 Runs,
