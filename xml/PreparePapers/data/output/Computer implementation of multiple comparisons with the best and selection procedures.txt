IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTIPLE COMPARISONS WITH THE BEST AND SELECTION PROCEDURES Jason C. Hsu Department 
of Statistics The Ohio State University 1958 Neil Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43210 RESEARCH SUMMARY The lack 
of computer software for Ranking and Selection has often been cited as a reason for it not having caught 
on in practice (Hayes 1982). Actually, this lack of software was a manifes- tation of some deeper perceived 
difficulties with practical usage, we believe. It was per- ceived that Bechhofer's (1954) Indifference 
Zone selection type inference was unavailable for single-stage experiments. The Multiple Comparisons 
with the Best (MCB) result of Hsu (1981) showed that not only is it available for single-stage experiments, 
it can be given simultaneously with Gupta's (1965) Subset Selection inference without decreasing the 
minimum confidence level of either. It has also been perceived that the unequal sample size case requires 
more complex methodologies than the equal sample size case. It is pointed out in Hsu (1983) that, so 
long as the analysis is performed on the computer, there needs to be no difference in methodology between 
the two cases. Based on these recent developments, a computer package has been written for Multiple Comparisons 
with the Best. Given the data (equal sample size or not) and the desired confidence level P* (: 1 -~), 
the first page output includes Subset Selection inference and Indifference Zone selection inference (extended 
to single-stage experiments), while the second page output gives the confidence intervals inference of 
Hsu (1981, 1982). All the inferences are guaranteed to be correct simultaneously with a probability of 
at least P*. The result of analysis of some water filter data using an earlier version of the package 
has been reported in Lorenz, Hsu, and Tuovinen (1982). ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is supported in
