Center User Services Rochester, N.Y. 14627 Bitnet: tina@uorvm OVERVIEW OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER 
AND THE COMPUTING CENTER The University of Rochester is located in Western New York. In addition to an 
outstanding Arts and Science program, the University of Rochester is especially well known for its Schools 
of Engineering and Optics, Simon School of Business, Eastman School of Music, and the School of Medicine 
and Dentistry. The University Computing Center provides computing support for all students, faculty and 
staff. The Director reports to the Vice Provost for Computing. The Computing Center is divided into a 
systems group, a user services/consulting group and a networking group, each led by an assistant director. 
User Services provides technical support for four mainframe computing platforms -2 IBM systems, VAX/VMS 
and Unix, as well as providing IBM PC and Macintosh support. Reporting to the Assistant Director for 
User Services are the consultants, the Computing Equipment Services facility, the graphics lab, the Computing 
and Reserve Library, and a number of public computing facilities. Because of the level and extent of 
services the Computing Center provides to the University community, we rely on well-trained, and highly 
motivated student staff members to assist us in providing these services. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES 
Taylor Hall The User Services facility at Taylor Hall, the primary location of consulting staff, employs 
approximately 15 students per year in a number of different positions. One position is a mainframe consulting 
position. These students are responsible for answering mainframe computing questions across four computing 
platforms. In addition, they answer questions pertaining to an adjacent graphics lab, a SUN workstation 
lab and Macintosh classroom. Other responsibilities entail phone consulting, maintenance of a documentation 
library and special project work. In the student consultant group, one student each year is chosen as 
lead student consultant. This student has managerial responsibilities, which include payroll generation, 
leading student meetings and assisting with hiring and training of new students. Taylor Hall also employs 
approximately three technical assistants each year. This is a higher level student position and is primarily 
microcomputer-oriented. Technical assistants teach non-credit courses, install hardware and soft ware, 
troubleshoot user .. .. . ... queshons, and Write CIOCUI MIMiItlOII. Permission to copy without fee

Looking for Answers****** o****-** ACM SIGUCCS XIX 1991 407 Computing and Reserve Libray (CARL) Formed 
as a joint venture between University libraries and the University Computing Center, this facility is 
housed in Rush Rhees Library. The faality is comprised of a 13 station IBM PS/2 classroom, a 14 station 
Mac LC classroom, and a general computing room with 60 Mats, 8 PC s, 12 terminals, 2 CD Rom workstations, 
a Mac Scanner, 15 impact printers and 7 laser printers. A Novell network links the workstations in the 
PS/2 room and an AppleShare network links all of the Mats in the facility. In addition, CARL has a very 
large collection of software, computing monographs and periodicals. The facility is open twenty four 
hours per day from noon Sunday until 9:00 p.m. Friday, and open from 10:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on Saturdays 
during the academic year. Approximately forty students our employed in four job categories -consultants, 
night owls, group leaders, and technical assistants. The majority of these students work as consultants, 
usually 8-12 hours per week. Their duties include both phone and in-person consulting, trouble shooting 
on a large variety of software packages, file transfers, disk recoveries, monitoring laser printing, 
and maintaining law and order for up to 100 patrons at any given time. Shifts are covered by 2-3 consultants 
and are usually four hours in length. Night owls work shifts between midnight and 8:00 a.m. Because these 
hours are much quieter, with an average of 20 users at any time, they also work on special projects, 
shelving of books and software and difficult disk recoveries. Group leaders are students who have worked 
at least one year as consultants and demonstrate leadership qualities. They assist the manager by doing 
student payroll, scheduling, training, software and hardware installation and troubleshooting. They work 
approximately 12-15 hours per week and their hours are flexible. They can only hold the group leader 
position for one year so that others might have an opportunity to attain this promotion. The technical 
assistant performs similar tasks to the group leaders and assists with network maintenance, classroom 
setup, training calendars, documentation, and policies and procedures. This person acts in the manager 
s absence. 408 ACM SICUCCS XIX 1991 . s  RECRUITMENT Theadage Nothing sells better than word of mouth 
is certainly true when recruiting students to work at the Computing Center. Most of the students we hire 
find out about the jobs through an acquaintance, or because they are frequent users of our facilities. 
In addition to word of mouth, other recruiting techniques are used to locate and hire students. The first 
is a summer job fair held by the student employment office. At this pb fair, incoming freshmen and transfer 
students are able to speak with on-campus empIoyers and fiIl out job applications for the fall. In the 
past two years, oneÂ­third of the Taylor Hall consulting staff has been hired through the job fair. Another 
way to search out qualified student applicants is through job listings made by the student employment 
office. However, it has not been necessary in the past few years to use these employment office listings 
because of the success of other recruiting methods discussed. In addition, we have a close relationship 
with the Computer Interest Floor (CIF), a student special interest housing floor, and have acquired several 
good employees from there. HIRING We are very fortunate to be able to select candidates that are already 
skilled. Three years ago, we hired students who were eager and willing to learn . Now we have to turn 
away students who come from high school with lists of skills that rival some professional resumes. We 
prefer hiring sophomores and juniors with the hope that we will be able to work with them for two or 
three years. Because we offer the best starting salary on campus and because it is not necessary for 
our employees to be receiving work study, we always have a waiting list of qualified applicants. We have 
a very low turnover rate during the year and returning students are given a 570 increase each fall and 
an additional 5 ZOif they stay for summer employment (approximately 10 students total for both locations). 
 EDUCATION We start the academic year with a three day intensive training program for new and returning 
students. We begin on Friday evening with an icebreaker event that involves students from .eeeee. ..e 
*Looting for Answers both locations. This evening allows a chance for everyone to meet, for us to present 
an overview of the University Computing Center structure and what their role in this structure involves, 
We work, together on team building exercises which include some robust game playing with Hollywood Computing 
Squares being a favorite. New this fall was the presentation of a student+reated video on How to Manage 
Difficult Situations . This video consisted of a variety of scenarios that a consultant would most likely 
have to deal with, and offered both incorrect and correct ways to manage these situations. This evening 
is very informal, great fun, and definitely a great way to break the ice. On the second day of the training 
workshop, we begin with a three hour session for new employees only. This session consists of basic training 
in operating systems and widely used software packages, necessary knowledge for all employees of the 
Computing Center. After the morning session, the entire group of new and returning employees meet for 
lunch. We find that group lunches, with a recreation break, encourage team building among student employees 
at each site. That afternoon is devoted to more specialized training. At this point, CARL and Taylor 
Hall students break into separate groups. CARL students attend training related to microcomputing support, 
such as file server or CD-ROM training. Taylor Hall students attend mainframe-related sessions such 
as Intro to VMS or Mini tab Software training. This afternoon session lasts three hours and students 
attend three different classes. Sessions are taught by User Services consulting staff and returning students 
who have expertise in specific areas. On the final day of training, we meet again in separate groups. 
In CARL, we work on library-type functions, such as signing out software, receiving returned materials, 
the sale of disks, etc. We also continue to work on policies and procedures that pertain specifically 
to our area. Taylor Hall students use this time to become familiar with the Mac II, Public Workstation 
and Graphics Labs located in their area. We meet once again as a group for lunch, frisbee-tossing and 
even a few displays of fine juggling or magic tricks. In the afternoon we return to hands-on classes 
that are mandatory for newcomers with some options for returning students. These classes include specific 
software applications, communications packages, virus detection, etc. Classes are approximately 45 minutes 
each and are meant to be an introduction only. Much of the material presented during the training weekend 
is documented in the Policy and Procedures Manual and on a HyperHelp stack. CONTINUING EDUCATION Computing 
and Reserve Library students are required to attend two mandatory training sessions and one mandatory 
meeting monthly. The University designates Wednesday afternoons as University Day, a time when no classes 
are scheduled, to allow students to take advantage of special seminars or trainings. That allows us the 
opportunity to gather our employees together for further education. The fourth Wednesday in the month 
is an optional brown bag session where a student or professional consultant will do a presentation on 
new software or hardware or give advanced instruction. We pay our students for their attendance at all 
of these sessions. Taylor Hall student consultants attend one mandatory training session per month. The 
sessions cover advanced hardware and software topics pertaining to mainframe computing, graphics lab 
systems or Macintosh computing. In addition, students are also required to attend a general meeting once 
a month. At this meeting, scheduling changes, upcoming events, staff changes and any other consulting 
staff issues are discussed. When they are hired, each student receives a policy and procedures manual 
specific to their location. This manual is updated frequently and contains job related information. The 
guidelines established in the manual are used throughout the year as a framework for providing consulting 
services to patrons. Lastly, education consists of teamwork. Both areas use a mentor program where every 
new student is paired with a returning student. In Taylor Hall, they will work together for at least 
one work shift for the entire first year of employment. For the first semester, it is also recommended 
that this work shift be in the middle of the day, during the busiest hours, so that the new employee 
is exposed to variety of consulting questions. Again, this strengthens the team-like attitude that we 
encourage. Looking for Answers **m **m *D*.**** ACM SZGUCCS XZX 1991 409 MOTIVATION User Services 
is known for its highly motivated and professional student staff. There are a number of techniques we 
use to keep our students motivated. First, we allow student staff unlimited computer resources. They 
are given mainframe accounts on all academic computing systems. They also have access to microcomputers 
and laser printers outside the busy public facilities on campus. Second, the Computing Center has the 
highest student pay scale for the Lhiiversity. New students are hired at a technical assist IV level. 
The pay range for this position is $5.30 to $5,80 per hour. Student group leaders and technical assistants 
are hired at a technical assistant V level. The pay range for this position is $6.80 to $10.00 per hour. 
Teaching assistants (level V also) are paid one and one-half times their normal hourly rate for assisting 
with a nonaedit course or $10.00 per hour for teaching and teaching preparation. Third, students can 
attend any non-credit computer course at no cost, and any brown bags or demos. The non-credit courses 
are taught by the Computing Center and are offered to faculty and staff on many University supported 
software programs and operating systems. Brown bags and demos are offered at different times throughout 
the year and are typically software presentations done by outside vendors. Fourth, students are supported 
in independent dqcision making. They are trusted to be in charge of their area when they are working 
and are allowed to make most decisions on their own. In order to foster even more independence in their 
work, students are encouraged to take on special project responsibilities. An example of a special project 
a student may engage in is teaching a special class for faculty or staff or upgrading and installing 
software, or creation of training materials. Lastly, students are invited to different computing center 
social and team building activities throughout the year. Students are invited to the annual summer picnic 
and winter holiday party for the Computing Center. In the past year student trips have been organized 
to local festivals, concerts and amusement parks. These activities bring students from CARL and Taylor 
Hall together in non-work settings, fostering friendship and a sense of group cohesiveness. In addition, 
often full-time staff members attend these activities, which allow students and staff time to interact 
and become acquainted with one another.  PROMOTION Students begin work for us as front-line consultants. 
After one year of employment, they are able to apply for approximately eight student leader positions; 
that is, as group leaders and technical assistants. Students also assist full-time consulting staff with 
the teaching of non-credit courses. Under the supervision of a staff member, a student teaching assistant 
is allowed to teach small sections of a course, eventually preparing him/her to teach as a full-fledged 
instructor. A matter of pride for the University Computing Center is that in the past two years, five 
of our student employees have been offered full time university positions as analyst/programmers. L~tingfor
