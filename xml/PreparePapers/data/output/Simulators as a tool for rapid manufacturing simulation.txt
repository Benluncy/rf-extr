and analysis of manufacturing modules. Included in the paper is a brief discussion of the simulators, 
the application of the simulators in solving a real world problem, and the lessons learned in using simulators. 
 INTRODUCTION After developing a number of simulation models of manufacturing systems, it became obvious 
that a relatively simple simulator may satisfy the needs of many apparel manufacturing firms. Several 
reasons support the use of a simulator. Fkst, many apparel firms lack sufficient data to adequately develop 
a detailed simulation model. As a result, the simulation model is greatly simplified. For example, the 
actual operation of a manufacturing module may not be thoroughly understood. It is not uncommon that 
the operation of the module has changed since the implementation. Therefore, the rules have changed for 
operator movement and the mean cycle times may have changed because of operator refinements. Second, 
most apparel modular manufacturing systems contain a small number of stations and operators. As a result, 
the simulation model is not very complex. Consequently, the majority of the features in a commercial 
simulation language are not required in a modular manufacturing simulation model. Third, many fiims lack 
the expertise tn develop detailed simulation models. Furthermore, these firms have only minimal background 
in describing manufacturing systems and in analyzing simulation model results. Finally, many small and 
medium size manufacturing firms cannot afford the relatively high cost of commercially available simulation 
software. Three simulators were developed for use with modular manufacturing systems (SSE3, SSE5, and 
SSE6). These simulators have been distributed since 1993. The next five sections illustrate how the simulator 
can be used for rapid evaluation of a production system. The final section reviews industrial response 
to the simulator as well as feedback on software use and effectiveness. 2 MODULAR MANUFACTURING The apparel 
manufacturing industry in the United States is undergoing significant changes. This change in manufacturing 
is in response to market pressures for rapid style changes and quick response to customer orders. For 
years, the standard method of manufacturing has been the progressive bundle system (PBS). In the PBS, 
operators sit at the machines with each operator performing only one operation. As a result, large amounts 
of work-in-process (WIP) generally build up between the stations. Garments are generally inspeeted at 
the end of the line. Work is done in lots of several dozen. Operators are paid based on production or 
a piece rate. Many firms are beginning to experiment with the concepts of modular manufacturing to improve 
the process, minimize system variability, improve quality, and reduce cost. Modular manufacturing has 
been defined as a contained, manageable work unit of five to 17 people performing a measurable task. 
The operators are interchangmble among tasks within the group to the extent practical, and incentive 
compensation is based upon the team s output of first quality product (Gilbert 1989). Some of the general 
characteristics of a modular manufacturing group are: Group members me cross-trained Group usually 
produces complete garments Each group member performs one or more sewing tasks Group chooses leader 
who interfaces with management Group given considerable latitude in per­ forming tasks and in machine 
assignments Inspection done within group which corrects errors Group has regular meetings on company 
time and with access to management when required 994 Simulators as a Tool for Rapid Manufacturing Simulation 
. Group is paid a f~ed salary, sometimes augmented by production bonuses . Group members credited only 
with defect-free production The advantages of modular manufacturing are: Reduced WIP and throughput time 
Reduced inspection and timekeeping Reduced supervision and bundle handling Reduced employee turnover 
and absenteeism Improved quality Increased worker and plant productivity It would be unrealistic not 
to list some of the disadvantages of modular manufacttuing as compared to the progressive bundle system. 
These disadvantages include: . Increased number of machines . Possible increase in floor space . Plantwide 
training maybe required before implementation . Considerable supervisory planning is needed when changing 
modules for new products 3 APPAREL MANUFACTURING MODULE Figure 1 shows the process flow for making a 
garment at Hilton Apparel. The line consists of seven stations with multiple machines at each station. 
The exception is Station 3 which is a manual operation not requiring a machine. The line has six operators. 
The maximum output achievable from this system can be realized if it is assumed dtat all operators can 
move to any machine in any order and extra machines are at each station. In that case . Sum of operation 
times= 10.07 minutes . Average cycle time = 10.07 rein/6 operators= 1.68 min. Maximum production per 
day = 480/1.68= 286 garments -- A realization of this line with seven stations utilizing ten machines 
and six operators is illustrated in Figure 2. There are no constraints on operator movement between stations. 
The SSE3 (Schroer, Wang 1993a) simulator was used to model this system using the mean cycle times given 
in Figure 2. A production of 286 is consistent with the calculations shown previously. This model is 
grossly simplified and may employ unrealistic assumptions. For instance, operators are 100% utilized. 
In the next two sections, more realistic models and configurations are developed to achieve maximum throughput 
at minimum cost. I 1.95 2.43 0.40 1.31 cutpa-E+J+­ tinished garments +-m-b m-d 5 mean cycle 1.85 0.53

 Figure 2 Modular Manufacturing Design Using SSE3 4 TSS MANUFACTURING MODULE DESIGN One common method 
of module operation is the Toyota Sewn System (TSS). The operator movement rules for the TSS are listed 
in Figure 3. The simulator SSE6 has been written specifically for evaluating TSS modules (Schroer and 
Wang 1992a) This configuration is based on seven stations with six machines, as illustrated in Figure 
1. In order to optimize system configuration, the number of operators is varied fmm three to six. (Runs 
1 to 4). Barrington et al. SSE6 operator movement rules: Items move forward in the manufacturing module. 
Operators move forward with the item and also move backwards for additional work. An operator performs 
an operation at a station and will move forward with the item to the next station and performs the operation 
until the operator reaches an operator at a station. The item is then placed in front of the station, 
or passeddirectly to the operator, if the operator if free. If an operator is not busy, the operator 
will move backwards until there is an available part. If there is no item waiting, the operator wiU interrupt 
the fiist operato] reached. The interrupted operator will then move backwards to either find an available 
item or another busy operator to interrupt. The interrupting operator wit] then complete the interrupted 
operation. Figure 3: SSE6 Operator Movement Rules Figure 4 shows the SSE6 simulator results as a function 
of the number of operators with only one machine at each station (except station 3, which has no machine. 
Note that the production did not increase above 169 by adding a fifth or sixth operator. WIP remained 
around 95 garments. Also, by adding a fifth operator, one operator was idle 100 percent of the time. 
By adding a sixth operator, two operators were idle 100 percent of the time. One approach to increase 
module production is to add duplicate machines at selected stations. The stations with Iong cycle times 
are logical selections. In this case, these are Stations 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the simulator results 
after adding more machines. Run 5 consisted of four operators and two machines at Station 2. This change 
increased production to 190 garments per day. Run 6 consisted of four operators and two machines at both 
Stations 1 and 2. In this case, the production remained at 190 garments per day. Run 7 consisted of adding 
a fifth operator and a second machine at Station 2. Production increased to 234 garments per day. Run 
8 consisted of five operators and two machines at both Stations 1 and 2. Production increased slightly 
to 238 garments per day. Note that adding additional machines not only increased production, but also 
reduced the WIP to less than five garments. Also, average operator utilization was 92 percent for Run 
8 (Reference TabIe 2). Table 3 gives the percentages each operator spent at each station for Run 8. Note 
that the operators worked in zones. For example, Operators 1 and 2 worked at Station 1 and 2. Operator 
3 worked at Station 2,3, and 4. Operator worked at Station 4,5, and 6. Operator worked at Station 6 and

3 Percent Time Operator Worked at Each Station for Run 8 S MIXED MANUFACTURING MODULE DESIGN It is 
generally impossible in most real world systems to have the operator move freely as in the TSS module. 
Instead, some operators are fixed at machines while others are cross-trained and work on several machines. 
The SSE5 simulator can be used to evaluate various operator assignments (Schroer and Wang 1992b). The 
operator movement rules are listed in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the layout of the modified module. Two 
machines were placed at Station 2 because of the large cycle time. All cycle times are normally distributed 
with the standard deviations set at ten percent of the means. The input parameters for a fixed operator 
are: Q Priority= 1 c Operator efficiency (%)= value 1 to 150 Q Other parameters -unused The input parameters 
for a moveable operator are Priority= 1, Z 3, ... (1 = home station) . Operator efficiency (%)= value 
1 to 150 s Lower WIP limit at this station= O, 1,2,3, ... lots Upper WIP limit at this station= O, 1,2,3,... 
lots c Bundle limit at this station= O, 1,23,... lots . Time limit operator spends at this station= 
any positive number The rules for the movement of a moveable operator are Rule 1: Operator will attempt 
to move to another station in the priority list when the operator has worked more than the Time Lmit 
at the current station+ or when the operator has completed, or exceeded, the Bundle Lnit at the current 
station and the operator has completed a lot of garments. Rule 2 If Rule 1 is satisfied, the operator 
will move from the current station to the fiit station in the priority list when one of the following 
conditions is satisfied Rule 2a: WIP at current station is LESS than the upper WIP limit and the WIP 
at a station in the priority list is GREATER than the upper WIP limit. Rule 2b WIP at current station 
is LESS than the lower WIP limit and the WIP at a station in the priority is GREATER than the lower WIP 
limit. If Rule 1 is satisfied and both Rules 2a and 2b are not satisfied, then the operator will stay 
at the current station and do another lot. After each lot the operator will try to move depending on 
Rules 2a or 2b. When the operator can no longer do work at the current station because there is no WIP 
and Rules 2a and 2b are not satisfied, the operator will attempt to go to the fust station in the priority 
list that has WIP greater than zero., rather than remain idle at the current station. However, if the 
operator still cannot move, the operator will remain at the current station and be idle. Note that the 
operator will attempt to move every time the system changes state. The above rules always check the parameters 
in the assigned priority sequence. For example, if the operator is at Station 4 and the priority sequence 
is Station 2, Station 3, Station 4, and Station 5, the rules are always fried starting with Station 2, 
then Station 3 and then Station 5. It should be noted that some of the parameters maybe set to zero. 
For example, if the Tree Limit and Bundle Lht are zero, then Rule 1 is always true and Rules 2a and 2b 
are tested after the operator has completed every lot. Figure 5: Operator Movement Rules for SSE5 Barrington

ouerators, 225 for Run 10 with six operators, and 259 f&#38; Run 11 with six operators. Production increased 
from Run 10 to Run 11 by only changing the operator movement rules and adding a machine at stations 1 
and 5. As the production increased, operator utilization also increased to 100 percent for Run 11. 6 
CASE STUDY Table 4 shows a comparison of the most promising module configurations. In summary, the following 
conclusions are . SSE3 validated that a daily production of 286 garments was achievable based on the 
current process (Alternative A). . Manufacturing module design (Alternative C) based on the TSS system 
(using simulator SSE6) resulted in a daily production of 234 garments with five rather than six operators. 
The production per operator averaged 47 garments with no WIP. . Manufacturing module design (Alternative 
E) based on some operators f~ed and others moveable (using Simulator SSE5) resulted in a daily production 
of 259 garments with six operatom. However a daily production of 232 garments was achieved (Alternative 
D) with only five operators and a lower WIP of 99 garments. Alternatives C or D atmear to be most l)romising 
in terms of production &#38; operator and W. -Alternative C had no work-in-process. Both of these alternatives 
resulted in twenty pement less production than Alternative A. However, the production per operator per 
day was only one to two garments less than Alternative A. Therefore, the labor cost per garment is about 
the same for Alternatives C and D. 7 INDUSTRY RESPONSE Experience with industry (and as the case study 
illustrates) demonstrates that the advantages of using manufacturing simulators, such as the SSES, are: 
Requires only minimal knowledge of a simulation language. Simulators are a very effective tool for modeling 
domain specific manufacturing systems. Most of the models developed using the SSES were written in less 
than fifteen minutes. Changing manufacturing module layou~ operator assignment, and machine allocation 
required only minor changes to the simulator spread sheets and were done in minutes. Sensitivity analyses 
can be performed in minutes. Simulators also have several disadvantages, including Simulators are domain 
specific requiring that manufacturing systems fit the design constraints and assumptions of the simulator. 
Modifying a simulator is very time consuming, since most simulators are written in a programming language 
such as C or FORTRAN. Considerable time is necessary to develop a simulator. This time is increased significantly 
if graphics, printing, and statistical capabilities are added. Simulators as a Tool for Rapid Manufacturing
