 A Fuzzy Model-Based Optimal Contzol Strategy A. AFSHARI and C. GEORGESCU EMTL - Schlumberger Industries, 
France~ ABSTRACT In the present contribution we develop a single invut- single o- utput fuzzy model-based 
metti-od for~he de'sign and synthesis of optimal tracking control systems. Optimal tracking control systems 
re-present a particular class of quadratic control that are based on a pure quadratic trackin..g error, 
criterion . The resulting.control strategy maintains the output close to a pre-specffied set- point.-The 
control strateg~r is continuously adapted by a receding horizon predictive algorithm that computes at 
each time step an adjustment for the extended control se- quence and applies effectively only the first 
value of this sequence. The ~,ey idea of the algorithm, is the derivation of the ad~bint system associated 
with a fuzzy dynamic system. This adjoint system can be represented as a fuzzy system so that, only linguistic 
models are used. The main advantage of this approach is the extension of optimal control results in order 
to handle fuzzy dynamic systems that can be the only available description of a possibly highly nonlinear 
plant. An adaptive version of this algo- rithm can be. easily developed and implemented. Numerical simulation 
results illustrate the applicability of the approach to a simple indoor climate ~dntrol sys- tem. Kevwords:

Temperature control application. Introduction The specification of a control problem can proceed by identif~ring 
the control objective with the optimization of a perform~.nce index. Usually theperformance index is 
an integral criterion that is evaluatedover a predictive hori- zon of time. The optimization can be handled 
either as a mathematical programming problem [11] or using results that make use of the special structure 
of a predictive con- trol optimization problem that expresses the solution in a recursive form. The straightforward 
approach to predic- tive control as a matherf~atical programming problem is limited by the required memory 
that is of the order of O(n 2) in the case of second order minimization algo- rithms and of the order 
O(n) in the case of first order al- gorithms. In either case the memory requirements are in- creasing 
rapidly with the dimension of the prediction horizon. A solution obtained by using the spdcial recur- 
sive structure of a predictive control problem can be is- sued either by the dynamic prosramrhing method 
or by minimum principle of Pontriaghin [12]. Tl4e dynamic pro- gramming method has the advantage that 
is conceptually simple and does not need an analytic description of the dynamic system, so that a linguistic 
(or fuzzy)- description can be used instead. This re~nark was effectively known for already some time 
(see [13,14]) but only lately has been detailed in a series of applications [8], due only to increasing 
available computin-g power. But this approach Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material

the "dimensionally course" as the memory requirements are increasing exponentially with the dimensioh 
of the problem that is~roportional to the length of the prediction horizon. So that, even with all the 
tric~ks of the trade that are used to simplify this ap- proach/ the computational complexity of involved 
by the final implementation remains considerable. A much more interesting approach is issued from the 
minimum principle thaflehas to necessary optimum conditions, and to equations that can be solved either 
an- alytically or numerically.. However the main difficulty that is envisaged in the application of 
the minimum prin- ciple for a fu~.zy system,-is the fact that analytical repre- sentation of the system 
is required. The main result pre- sented in this paper allows the formulation of the n~ini- mum principle 
for plants where only a fuzzy description is available and leads to a numericaI solution for the con- 
trol strategy. For the lack of simplicity we treat here only a special class of predictive control problems 
where the criterion to be minimized is the quadratic error between a pre-sched- uled tracking trajectory 
and the systems trajectory. These kind of control problems are conventionally named as tracking problems 
(see [12} and [13]). We focus here on the solution of such problems for the case when the model of the 
plant is given by a qualitative model ex- pressed in terms of a fuzzy logic rule base and parametrized 
by correspondingly defined fuzzy sets. The haain theoretical pointgare th~ derivation of the adjoint 
system of a fuzzy~system and of the gradient correction of the current control strategy. This correction 
is realized as the back-propagation of the tracking error through the adjoint system integrated in reverse 
time. The general conditions given by the minimum principle [11] are adapted to representation of fuzzy 
dynamic systems leading to the derivation of the adjoint of a fuzzy system. What 1~ particularly interesting 
is that this adjoint system can be expressed as a fuzzy system and it can be obtained by simple manipulations 
from the initial fuzzy model of the plant. The idea of extending analytical results of predictive con- 
trol theory for the fuzzy systems has already been used in [5], where a very simple Predictive PID control 
is devel- oped. A generalized predictive control-like algorithm is further developed in [9] or in [10], 
where different gradi- ent corrections of the control strategy are used. But the correction is computed 
on all the horizon rather than re- cursively. The idea of computing the adjoint of a fuzzy dynamically 
system and use it fo~ predictive control was introduced inDS]. In the present paper we give a fuzzy representation 
for the resulting equations of the adjoint system by introducing the notion of the fuzzy sensitivity 
membership functions associated with the fuzzy parti- tions describing the system. The connex results 
are used to infer the degcription of the adjoint of a dynamic sys- tem, but the algorithm is much more 
generaland can be used to obtain a general fuzzy representation for the dif- ferential operators applied 
to fuzzy functions. We also in- troduce a fuzzy adaptation mechanism for the gain of the predictive control 
adjusting strategy. Finally we show how the tracking algorithm can be used in order to achieve predictivedisturbance 
rejection, for the processes where the disturbances are known in advance. Precise knowledge of the future 
perturbations affecting the sys-tem is not necessary, and can be replaced with a quahta- tire description 
of these perturbation, given in terms of f.~zy sets. 120 FuzzyFunction Representation Fuzzy sets were 
introduced by Zadeh in 1965 as an ap- propriate way to represent imprecision and incertitude. In the 
seminaI paper[l] Zadeh introduced the object of a fuzzy set as a ~t-with no definite frontier that is 
defined by its membership function and characterised the opera- tions between the fuzzy sets in terms 
of the membership functions. This is the basic idea of the fuzzy theory. Every element of a fuzzy set 
is thus characterised by a degree of membership, to the fuzzy set,hat can take any v~lue in the interval 
[0, 1] as compared with an usual set where an dement is either in the se-t or out of it. A usual, "crisp" 
set is thus a limit case of a fuzzy set, and thus a fuzzy set is a natural extension of crisp sets. A 
further development of these ideas was done by Zadeh in 1968 [2] and 1973 where there were laid the basis 
of the description of com- plex systems in terms of the new fuzzy language. This hew tool is particularly 
adapted for modeling the evolu- tion of complex and imprecise systems. A precise numer- ical parametrization 
of ~he linguistic orders of magnitude is defined by a fuzzy partition of the universe of dis- course 
X, that is a collection X of fuzzy sets: .X = {X1,X2, ...,Xnx} that satisfies the normalization relation: 
--.-S~llaX'(X)=l for any x. This condition is im- posed by the use of the special fuzzy logic connectors 
that are described further. - A fuzzy representation of a function f describes the in- Ut-output behavior 
of an analytical unknown function, assi~:nin g fuzzy values in the output domain Y to crisp values from 
the input domain X, by means of the fuzzy inference mechanism. The algebraic interpretation of the multi 
input fuzzy inference-is that starting from fuzzy partitions defined component-wise on each of component 
sub-domains of the i~iput universe X, one constructs a global fuzzy partition ~r the aU the universe 
X. This par- tition is thereafter used to compute the firing power of each rule in the rule base, that 
as-sociates to an~, input hy- pothesis an. output consequence that can. be either a fuzzy set or a crisp 
value. The rule base defines the fuzzy de- scription of the input-output behavior of the function f. 
A simplified representation of the function f.can ob-tained if we make several hypothesis that we will 
de- scribe in what will follow. The fuzzification operation is given by a singleton o(x*) that is a fuzzy 
set the is naturally associated with a crisp value and is defined as: tao.C~-)(x) = 6(x-x*) = if x = 
x* (1) The output h~Try partition y consists only of singletons: = { a(yi) }~.x., This is known as 5ugeno's 
method (I3]). and is the preferred in the cases where the simplicity of the implementation is included 
as a design constraint. We also consider the case where there is ofily a unique rule that is activated 
for each hypothesis. This means~hat the rule strelagths are either 0 or 1. The fuzzy operators are chosen 
as ]2p^Q = ]2p ./.ZQ and /.tpv Q ='~p + ~Q. These forms of the fuzzy connectors are great!y simplify- 
ing the calculations, especially for the defuzzification, but they impose that the normalization condition 
of the fuzzy artition is strictly verified We obtain, undei" these hy- P , . . pothesls, a simple description 
for the input-output behav- ior for the fuzz-y functio-nal representa-tion. The general formula of a 
fuzzy function is given by: (2) y ° = f(x')= ~ p ~:._.: / x .a ..... x''), m( x~ ...... x~", ,x" ) i.(i

to the introduction of the f~zzy sensitivityj membership functions associated with a htzzy partition. 
We first define a unimodular fuzzy mem- bership function 12A(X) as a membership function that has a connex 
kernel. We introduce a fuzzy univariate raem- "bership. function as a fuzzy set 12A(X) for which -~xga(x)> 
0, x>xc and ga(x)_>O, x<xc are unimodular. With this definitions, for a given fuzzy par- tition Z:lgx,(x)=l 
the associated fuzzy sensitivity membership [unctions are defined by the formula: 0 ~#x,.(x) rl~,,, (x)

Conditions Given by the Minimum Principle For the dynamic system described by the following state space 
equations: x(t + 1) = f(x,u,t) (9) with the initial condition x(t o) = x o. The state x e 9~", the control 
u a f2 ~ 9~" and f is a function that is sufficiently smooth. We form the cost functional: t/-1 J = M(x(t/),t/)+ 
E L(x,u,t) '='* (I0) and we formulate the control optimization problem as the minimization of this functional: 
J = min. We form the associated discrete Hamiltonian function: H(x,u,~,t)=~T(t+l).f(x,u,t)+L(x,u,t) (11) 
with X the adjoint (co)vector ;t e ~". Suppose that the solution to the optimization problem is given 
by the opti- mal input u*(t) that generates the optimal trajectory x" (t). Then the necessary conditions 
given by the dis- crete minimum principle are: x(t + 1) = H~.(t+l)(X,U,~,t) ~(t) = Hx(o(x,u,k,t) (12) 
H(x', ¢. X'. t) = mi,~ H(x'.u.X',t) together with the boundary" conditions: 0 = [Mx(x(tf),ty ) - Z(ty)]. 
Xy + (13) +[Mt(x(t f ),t f ) + H(x,u,X,t f )]" t f and for a fixed final time tf we have the terminal 
condi- tion: ~ 04)--/M-¢x(t')'t/~ = Z(t/) Rewriting the first two optimal conditions (8) we obtain: x(t 
+ 1) = f(x(t),u(t),t) x(t,) = x, ~(t) = fx(X,U,t). X(t + 1) + Lx(X(t),u(t),t) (15) Z(/f) = gx'(X(tf),tf) 
 In the case with no constraints, the last of the necessary conditions become: 0 = Hu(t)(x,u,2t.,t) = 
(16) = Lu(x,u,t)+ fu(X,U,t)" ~.(t + 1) We havebeen using the notation fx(x,y)=[---~-~] T" The Gradient 
Method for Fuzzy Systems Albeit some very simple cases of the general optimization problem, that have 
an analytical explicit solution, one is contrived to use numerical methods to approach the op- timal 
solution. The gradient method is probably the sifn- plest iterative method. If at the iteration step 
k we have an approximate optimal solution u(k)(t) and the associ- ated trajectory x(k)(t) issued from 
the integration of the ecluation x(t + 1) = H;t(,+l ) (x, u, ~, t) that respects the initial condition 
X(to)=X o, then the costate vector ~(k)(t) that respects the final condition Z (t!) = M x (x(t/), tf) 
can be obtain by the integration of equation L(t) = Hx(t)(x,u,.~.,t ). The minimum of the functional 
H(x,u,&#38;,t) can be pursued by searching in the steepest descent direction given by the gradient of 
the hamiltohian function H : SH(x,u,~,t) = <Hu(x,u,Z,t)lSu ) (17) so that a reasonable choice may be: 
6u = u(/~+l)(t) -u(k)(t) = --y. Hu(x,u,A,t ) (18) with y _> 0 a real positive constant that can be found 
by a monovariable minimum search procedure. The gradient algorithm can be implemented with the initialization 
step u(t) = u(0)(t). Then with u(t) = u(k)(t) integrate the equation: x(t + 1) = f(x,u,t) x(to) = xo 
in order to obtain the trajectory: x(t) = X(k)(t). With u(t) = u(k)(t) and x(t) = x(k)(t) integrate backwards 
in time the eclua- tiOn: ,~.(t) = nx(t)(x,u,.~.,l ) , ~(lf ) = Mx(.x(tf ),tf ) in order to obtain the 
costate ~(t) = ~.(k)(t). Then we generate the new control: u (k+l) (t) = u(k)(t)- y. H u (x, u, ~, t) 
(19) The terminating condition is on the norm of the gradient: Ilnu (x,u,Z,t) -<Emm (20) Fuzzy Model-Based 
Tracking Systems Using the canonical fuzzy function representation, a de- scription of a fuzzy dynamic 
system can be given as a fuz~.y version of a non linear discrete system: x(t + 1) = f(x(t),u(t),t) (21) 
y(t) = h(x(??),t). with functions f and h defined by their canonical fuzzy function representation. The 
state of the system is x, the input is u and the output is y. A pure tracking problem can then be defined 
if in the crite- rion (6) we take L(x,u,t) as the tracking error between the actual output and the desired 
output trajectory: L(x,u,t) = II y(t)* - y(t)12 = e(t) 2 (22) Then the equations (11) become: x(t + 
1) = f(x(t),u(t),t) x(to) = x, (23) 2(t) = fx(X,U,t). X(t + 1) -hx(x(t),u(t),t), e , L(tf) = 0 f and 
the gradient correction (14) becomes: U = --y, Hu(X,U,~.,t) = -7" f u(x,u,t)" ~(t + 1) If the variable 
x is directly measurable then: x(t + 1) = f(x(t),u(t),t) (24) , X(to) = xo ~.(t) = fx(x,u,t). X(t + 
1)-e(t) (25) , A (tf) = 0 The adjoint of a fuzzy dynamic system The second equation (23) represents 
the adioint of the fuzzy system with respect to the tracking criterion. The interpretation of the equation 
is that of an error k that is back propagating through a" temporal network. The cor- rection in equation 
is proportional to this error. In order to compute the derivatives fu(X,U,t) and fx(X,U,t)we use the 
results already obtained. For a time invariant fuzzy system: X(t + 1) = f(x(t),u(t)) (26) that is described 
in terms of rules of the kind: "if (x(t) is SMALL) and (u(t) is HIGH) (27) then (x(t+l) is BIG)" or "if 
(x(t) is SMALL) and iu(t) is HIGH)(28)  then (xCt+~) isx(t + 1) = ~Ok(x(t),u(t)))" 017 "if (x(t) is 
SMALL) and (u(t) is HIGH)(29) then (x(t+l) isX(t + l)= ~k(X(t))+ Yk(x(t))'u(t))" at their turn parametrized 
by the fuzzy partitions: 0 = {U 1 ..... Unu} and ~ = {X! ..... X,x} The equation (27) describes a classical 
fuzzy system, equation (28) a Sugeno fuzzy system and equation (29) a semianalytic systefn (partially 
analytic, partially fuzzy). 123 The gradient algorithm for fuzzy models First we simulate, for a test 
control sequence,' forward in time, the fuzzy model given by: X(t + 1) = f(x(t),u(t),t) , x(t,) = Xo 
in order to obtain the grbping trajectory {x(t 0) ..... x(t f)). Then we back-propagate the tracking 
error through the adjoint of the frizzy system: A(t)= fx(x,u,t).t(t+i)-e(t) , Z(tf) =0 and we obtain 
the adjoint co-vector k. The value of fx(X,U,t) is determined bythe eq. (4), identifying the two activated 
linguistic cells so that x E [X k ,Xk+ 1 ] Thereafter we apply the control strategy correction: 8u = 
-7" Hu(x,u,; ,O = -7" fu(X,U,t)" $(t + 1) (28) The value of fu(x,u,t) is determined by the equation (4), 
identifying the two activated linguistic cells corre- sponding to the points u [u k,uk+l ] Fuzzy adaptation 
of the gradient gain The equation (28) include predictive information by the back propagation of the 
tracking error through the ad- joint system over the predictivehorizon. However the feedback information 
istaken into account only through the sliding horizon strategy. We can reinforce the feed- back loopby 
adding a proportional term to the equation (28) that will have in integral effect due to the incremen- 
tal form of the equation: 8u = -7" Hu(x,u,A,t) =-7(e,z~e). fu(X,U,t). Z(t + 1) (29) The gradient gain 
can be adapted by a fuzzy rule set of the form: "if (a(t) is SMALL) aM (~e(t) is HIGH) (30) then (~is 
BIG) " Predictive disturbance rejection The process can have a predictable disturbance ~ (t): x(t + 
1) = f(x(t), ~(t),u(t),t) (31) with a possible fuzzy description of the form: "if (x(t) is SMALL) and~(l) 
is BIG) (32) and (u(t) is HIGH) then (x(t+l) is BIG)" The advantage is that the order of magnitude of 
the dis- turbance ~ (t) must be known in advance only with ap- proximation. Then the gradient control 
correction is the same (29) but the back propagated error will contain also the information about the 
time and magnitude of the fu- ture perturbation and will adapt the control input accord- ingl3/. The 
disturbance can be 15redicted as: - "if (time is SOON) then ~.~(t)is BIG)" (33) Application Case Study 
The algorithm was applied to a building heatingprocess. The temperature inside a building is established 
as the result of a thermal balance that sums up the heat ex-changes with the walls, solar radiative gains 
through the wallg-and windows, the renewal of theinterior air with exterior fresh air and the heat extracted 
or dissipated in the room by the cooling or heating devices or by other sources of heat. The actual process 
fs infinite dimensional and is described by a system of'partial differential equa- tions coupled by their 
frontier conditions. However, sim- plified ptiysical reasoning can provide low order lumped models that 
are accurate enough for control purposes (see [20]). The process output is the indoor temperature Ti 
that characterizes the living zone, and the process in- put is the actual heating or cooling power P 
that is deliv- ered into the zone. The external t~n~perature Te is a mea- surable perturbation and the 
solar radiation or other un- known heating sources gathered in W are non measur- able perturbations. 
A first order nonlinear model of the .plant is: -W, e) that can be described by rules of the form: if

/  OF TEXT ~ O" MODEL k ^LcOam, Mj l -I /  Jl FUZZY CORRECTION Fig. 3 The Fuzzy model-based predictive 
control scheme The control is based on a fuzzy model that is adapted on line in order to compensate the 
initial modeling errors with which the fuzzy-model was acti8vated. This adapta- tion is done with the 
fuzzy model adaptation tools de- scribed in [6]-[I0]. Constam handling strategies can be added to the 
system in order to deal-wit constraints on input and output variables. In Figures (4...6) we show the 
numerical simmulations of the algorithm. Conclusion In the present article a tracking algorithm that 
is based on fuzzy qualitative models is described The algorithm uses a specihl fuzzy parametrization 
of the process model in order to make use of general results trom the optimal control theory. The fuz~.y 
model is treated as a nofilinear system for which an adjoint system is build and a reced- ing horizon 
correction of the control strategy is applied. At each step fuzzy model is predicted over the prediction 
horizon and the tracking-error is back pr-opagated through the adjoint of the fuzzy model in order to 
deter- mine the correction to the control strategy. The interest of this approach is of showing how advanced 
predictive control-strategies can be applied to fuzzy models. With respect to other existing predictive 
control -proaches'based on the use of fuzzy models for the ~e P-" scription of the process, the present 
approach distin- guishes itself by the fact that the numerical complexity that is involved by the control 
strategy search procedure is considerably alleviated. --- References [1] Zadeh, L.A. - Fuzzy Sets, Informationand
