 SOME COMPUTATIONS INVOLVING SIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS N. Burgoyne and C. Williamson Mathematics Department 
 University of California, Santa Cruz, California §i. Introduction This article is a report of some 
compu- tations that were done recently with the hope of understanding an apparently simple, though as 
yet unanswered, question in linear algebra. To describe and motivate this problem a little background 
is needed. Let V denote an n-dimensional vector space (over the com- plex numbers) and let GL(V) denote 
the group of all non-singular linear transformations of V into itself. With respect to some basis of 
V the elements of GL(V) are naturally re- presented as complex n × n matrices with non- zero determinant. 
Let Tr(V ) denote the vector space consisting of all tensors of rank r over V (with Ti(V ) = V). The 
action of GL(V) on V extends in a natural way to Tr(V ) but now, if r ~ 2, this action is not irreducible. 
That is, there are subspaces of Tr(V ) which are transformed onto themselves by GL(V). One may ask what 
are the irreduc- ible subspaces of Tr(V ). The answer is quite simple: an irreducible subspace of Tr(V 
) consists of all tensors having a certain sym- metry. In a given basis of V this symmetry is explicitly 
given in terms of the r indi- ces of the components of the tensor. For example if r = 2 the components 
of a tensor of rank 2 are of the form (tli) i,j=l,2,..., n and there are just two possible symmetries: 
 tij = tji gives the subspace of all symmetric (rank 2) tensors tij =-tji gives the subspace of all 
skew- symmetric (rank 2) tensors Note that any rank 2 tensor can always be written in a unique manner 
as a sum of a sym- metric and a skew-symmetric tensor: = 1 _ s j l) sij Y (sij + sji) + ½ (sij These 
simple ideas extend without difficulty to r > 2. The above decomposition (of sij ) is of course more 
involved for the tensor Sili2"''ir' the exact form is not needed but will involve fractional coefficients 
with in- tegers between 1 and r in the denominator. For details see for example [I]. The fact that the 
field of numbers was the complexes is of no particular importance and the theory is identical for any 
field of characteristic zero. Since this decomposition, into irreducible subspaces, of the tensor spaces 
of V is of great use in many other parts of mathematics, it is worth knowing the results for ant field 
of numbers. However if the field has characteristic p (where p is, by necessity, a prime number) the 
theory col- lapses. The reason is quite simple: if r ~ p the expressions giving the decomposition of 
an arbitrary tensor may contain p i.e., 0, in the denominator of certain coefficients (this is obvious, 
from the above formula, for r = p = 2) and hence these expressions are meaning- less. The unanswered 
question is then thls-- how does one describe the irreducible sub- spaces of Tr(V ) when V is a vector 
space over a field of characteristic p? The question has been answered when the dimension of V is less 
than 3 but, apart from some special cases, no general answer is known for dimensions ~ 4. In attacking 
this problem one can try to generalize quite di- rectly the arguments that are used in the classical 
case (when the field has character- istic zero). This is the approach of Thrall [2] and it leads rapidly 
into some equivalent but seemingly difficult questions about the syrmmetrlc group. Another approach is 
to study a more general problem. Concentrate on the group GL(V), it is easily seen that one can equally 
well study SL(V), its subgroup of elements with determinant = i. Now SL(V) is a member of the class of 
so-called Chevalley groups (these are just the analogues, over an arbitrary field of numbers, of the 
well known simple Lie groups), and for these groups many 16z questions can be further reduced by studying 
the corresponding Lie algebras. The question then becomes the following--how does one find all the irreducible 
representations of a Lie algebra of a Chevalley group? One difficulty with this approach is that it involves 
a cer- tain amount of terminology. We can only apol- ogize to those readers who may be unfamiliar with 
it, assure them that it is natural and necessary, and refer them to some helpful references [3,4]. In 
particular the first of these references gives a full discussion of the background of the (restated) 
question. In §2 we outline a practical algorithm for constructing the irreducible representa- tions 
of a Lie algebra of a Chevalley group. The method is described in more detail in [5]. In ~3 we give a 
brief outline of the computa- tional methods which were used. The main results are collected in Table 
i. Tables 2 and 3 give examples of certain preliminary computations. §2. The theoretical background 
is discussed in [5] and so we only give a brief surmnary here. We use the following notation: G is a 
complex simple Lie algebra of rank E + is a set of positive roots of G and {~i,...,~] are the simple 
roots in E + A is the set of dominant integral weights and (%1,...,%~} are the fundamental weights. 
The elements of g+ and Euclidean vector space V Let the inner product in (~,B) and then put <~,~) ~ 0. 
The ~ × ~ matrix A lie in a real of dimension ~. V be denoted by = 2(~,~)/(~,~) if (cil)~ where cij 
= <~j,~i> is called the Cartan matrix of G, and completely characterizes G. Any % c A has a unique 
expression % = E mih i with m i a non-negative integer. The irreducible finite dimensional represen- 
 tations of G are in one to one correspon- dence with the elements of A. For example if G is the Lie 
algebra of SL(V) its nat- ural n-dimensional representation corresponds to %1' and the symmetric and 
skew-symmetric rank 2 tensor representations correspond to 2% 1 and ~2 respectively. This correspon- 
 163 dence extends to arbitrary ~ ¢ A and arbi- trary tensor representations of SL(V). Now the elements 
of A are partitioned into disjoint chains such that %, ~ are in the same chain if and only if h-~ is 
an in- tegral combination of elements of E +. If ~, ~ are in the same chain we write ~ > and call ~ a 
sub-weight of % if ~-~ is a non-negative integral combination of ele- ments of E +. This gives a partial 
ordering to each chain. See the end of §3 for an example. Now to describe the representation cor- responding 
to some ~ E A we need only de- cribe the multiplicity with which a sub-weight of ~ occurs. The method 
given in [5] leads to a certain integral matrix (aMN) whose coefficients are indexed by the various 
possible partitions of \-u as a sum of ele- ments of E +. The above mentioned multiplic- ity is given 
by the rank of this matrix (aMN). Furthermore if we wish to consider what happens over a field of characteristic 
p # 0 then the new multiplicity equals the rank of (aMN) when its coefficients are considered modulo 
p. Our method is to compute the elementary divisors of (aMN). Then the rank can be read of by seeing 
how many elementary divisors are relatively prime to p. The multiplicities are tabulated for certain 
examples in Table i. §3. Although the algorithm described in the previous section is quite practical, 
at least for low rank and small weights, it does not give any direct understanding of why the de- 
compositions occur. So it was decided to exploit the algorithm and compute as many ex- amples as seemed 
practical with the hope that certain patterns might appear. In fact, a detailed study of the contents 
of Table 1 leads to several conjectures. Here however we will only discuss the practical aspects of 
the computations. Some simple examples quickly show that hand computation would be prohibitively slow. 
 But since it is just arithmetic an electric computing machine can be used for the calcu- lations. 
These were carried out on an IBM model 360-50 using assembler language for the computational subroutines 
and Fortran for the input-output routines. The main subroutines were Pi: input = Cartan matrix of given 
Lie algebra. output = E + and the commutators [e ,es] and [e ,fs] with ~ > 9. P2: input = output of 
Pi and a hi-weight % and its sub-weight ~. output = the matrix (aMN) P3: input = output of P2. output 
= elementary divisiors of (aMN). The program P3 is a straightforward use of the usual algorithm for 
finding the ele- mentary divisors of an integral matrix. It can handle matrices of any size and is very 
fast. The program Pi requires an algorithm for describing the signs (~i) in the commutators of the elements 
of a Chevalley basis for the algebra. This is not difficult to describe (and the theory will be given 
in a separate article). As an example of its output we give Table 3. The program P2 is where the limitations 
of time come in. For example if %-~ has Q partitions then the matrix (aMN) has Q2 entries. Furthermore 
the time required for the computation of a single aMN goes up rapidly with L = E n i where % -~ = E ni~ 
i. It is these factors which limit the algorithm to low rank and small weights (i.e., Q ~ i00, L ~ i0 
approx.). The actual routines Pi and P2 are rather long and of course involve numerous cross- checks. 
A particularly strong check is the requirement that each aMN turn out to be an integer. Another completely 
independent cross-check was used on every entry in Table i and is worth describing in some detail. 
 The final output of the program, for a given Lie algebra and given % and o is a set of m positive integers, 
namely the ele- mentary divisors. Now this number m can be obtained directly by one of several explicit 
formulas for the multiplicity of ~ in %. These formulas are due to Freudenthal and Kostant (and this 
latter has recently been modified by various authors). For practical 164 calculations neither of these 
formulas gives the best approach. Instead one should follow the method of reference [6]. In particular 
 the construction of his "table D", or the relevant part of it. This construction is not fully explained 
in the above reference but can easily be deduced and leads to a very rapid algorithm for constructing 
any such "table D". Once this is done the table of multiplicities follows from a greatly simpli- fied 
form of Freudenthal's formula. A com- puter is not needed, even for rather deep sub- weights in, for 
example, E 8. As an example Table 2 gives "table D" and the multiplicities for the first 13 weights 
in the chain with lowest weight 0 of E 7. It is perhaps worth showing the actual shape of this chain: 
 Ioo0, Io oooool ____._...-----] ooooo JlOO, ,IOOI j,OOl' °°sOl ,oooi looololol etc. Description of 
the Tables  Table I: For each of the algebras G2, A3, B3, C3, A4, B4, C4, D4, F 4 the Cartan matrlx 
is first given. This is followed by one or more tables corre- sponding to the distinct chains of dominant 
weights. In these tables the left hand column contains the weights with the abbreviation m I m 2 ... 
m~ for ml% I + ... + m~%~. The topmost entry is always the unique smallest weight in that chain. Opposite 
each initial entry of a weight are given the multiplicities of its various sub-weights at characteristic 
 O. If the weight is repeated and followed by a prime number then the entries are the multi- plicities 
for the corresponding irreducible module over a field having that prime as its characteristic. All possible 
(restricted) reductions are given (i.e., for all p satis- fying m I < p for i = i,...,~). To read the 
table imagine that the columns are in- dexed, in the same order, by the weights in the left hand column. 
Then the entry opposite weight A and in column ~ is the multiplicity with which the sub-weight ~ occurs 
in the module with hi-weight A. For example for G2, E 1 occurs in E 1 + A 2 with multiplicity 3 at characteristic 
p = 3, with multiplicity 2 at characteristic p = 7, and with multiplicity 4 for any other characteristic. 
 Using these tables, the dimensions and other information about the representations are obtained by 
the usual methods. Table 2: For the Lie algebra E 7 and the chain with 0 as its lowest weight, the "table 
D" (see §3) and the charac- teristic 0 multiplicities are given. The level of X is just z n I where 
~ = E ni~i, it is used only to give a simple method of indexing the columns. For example, the multi- 
plicity of A 2 in E4 + %6 is 129. Table 3: The rows and columns are indexed by the 24 roots in E + of 
F 4. For example 1321 refers to the root el + 3~2 + 2~3 + ~4" If ~ denotes a row and 8 a column then 
if the corresponding entry is the integer N (a blank means N = 0) wehave: entry in upper triangle means 
[eB,e~]=Ne~+ 6 entry in lower triangle means [e ,fB]=Ne _ s Thus  [e~l+2~2+~3+~4'e~l+2~2+~3]= -2e2~i+4~2+2~3+~ 
4 and [eal+~2,f~2] = -eel. 16S TABLE i O0 i i00 i0 i i 011 2 1 i0, p = 2 0 i 011, p = 3 i i 01
