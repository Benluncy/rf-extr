 ABSTRACT CLV type optlcal disks IS a very large and Important class of optical disk technology, of 
which CD-ROM disks form a subclass In this paper we present a model of retrieval from CLV optlcal disks 
We then provide exact and approximate results analyzmg the retrieval performance from them Our analysis 
takes mto account disks with and without a mirror m the read mechanism, small objects completely placed 
wlthm block boundarles, placement that allows block boundary crossmg, as well as very large objects (such 
as documents) placed wlthm flies In the second part of the paper we describe some fundamental Imphcatlons 
of physlcal data base design for data bases stored on CLV optical disks We show that very slgmflcant 
perfor-mance game may be reahzed by appropriate design 1. Introduction The Immense storage capacltles, 
economtcal costs and good retrieval performance presently offered by various forms of optrcal disk technology 
are makmg It an attractive choice as a storage medmm for large data base apphca- tlons They are also 
makmg possible new and more demandmg apphcatlons such as multlmedla databases which require large amounts 
of high performance storage Further advances m the technology expected m the near future such as even 
greater storage capacity, still lower costs and faster access times, and the posslblhty of erasable optlcal 
disks, promise to ensure that it ~111 contmue to grow as a promment storage technology for some time

Angular Veloczty (CAV) disks, which rotate at a fixed rate but have a variable storage density and that 
of Constant Lznear Wocrty (CLV) disks, which rotate at a variable rate but have a fixed storage density 
The two forms embody the trade-offs of speed and storage, CAV type disks have faster access times while 
In general CLV type disks have greater storage capacity Currently, CLV technology IS being used extensively 
m all CD-ROM s (read only disks) to publish and dstn- bute large volumes of data and mformatlon It IS 
also used in some WORM (Write Once Read Many times) [8] designs WORM disks are used m data base or multlmedla 
archival apphcatlons Since the retrieval performance of an applmatlon s storage system plays a very important 
role m the success of the apphcatlon, It IS critIca to understand and produce analytic estimates of the 
performance of optical disks Such knowledge ~111 be useful m the development of data structures, query 
optimizers and other techmques and tools important to the enhancement of the retrieval performance of 
systems employmg optical disk technology For optical disks, the seek time IS generally much larger than 
the rotational latency Though some WORM disks are faster, delays of up to one second or more are possible 
with the current CD-ROM technology and so the seek time IS usually the most important factor m the time 
required to answer a query The issue 1s complicated slightly however by some optical disk drives which 
are capable of reading from more than one track without perform-mg a seek The access mechamsm on some 
drives IS equipped with an adJustable mirror that allows slight deflections of the beam of laser light 
used to read the data This enables it to be almed at any one of a small set of tracks lmmedlately beneath 
the head This set of tracks IS called a span and the number of tracks m the set IS called the span stze 
This capablhty can be likened to cylmders on magnetic disk packs except that for optical disks the sets 
of tracks m spans can be overlappmg This span access capablhty IS provided by manufactures of both CAV 
and CLV disk drives (although currently, It 1s more frequently encountered with CAV drives) We examine 
three cases of retrieval from CLV disks and determme the requlrzd number of seeks m each The first two, 
for non-crossing objects and crossrng objects, involve the retrieval of oblects close m size to a disk 
sector A non-crossang object IS completely contained wlthm a sector and hence can be retrieved with one 
sector access, such placement of objects may frequently be employed when storing records A crossrng object 
may overlap sector boundarles and so could possibly require more than one sector to be accessed for Its 
retrieval The third case we examme IS for large objects, of which bitmaps and dlgltized sound are prime 
examples The size of such large objects can be of the order of 300 to 500K or more, and can exceed the 
capacity of several tracks on the disk and require more than one seek to be retrieved Because there IS 
a one-to-one relatlonshlp between the mmlmum number of seeks required to retrieve a set of objects from 
a file and the mmlmum number of non-overlappmg spans (sets of tracks) required to cover) those oblectsl, 
it IS sufficient to restrict our analysis to determining that number of spans Note that a span size of 
one track corresponds to the conventional case of no deflecting mirror (although the characterlstlcs 
of CLV disks make the analysis different than CAV disks) 2. A Model and a Schedule An optical disk 1s 
a device composed of T ordered tracks, an access mechamsm and a viewing mechamsm A track IS represented 
by Its sequence number 1 wlthm the tracks of the device, a=1,2, ,T (to avoid dlscusslon about boundary 
condltlons we assume that track numbers are extended above T and below 1) Each track IS com- posed of 
a number of sectors (or blocks) The access mechanism can be posItIoned at any track When the access mechanism 
1s posItioned at a certam track 1, the device can read data which completely exist wlthm &#38; consecutive 
tracks (track a IS one of them) In order to do that, the viewing mechamsm focuses to a particular track 
with quah-fymg data (within the &#38; tracks) We call the &#38; consecutive tracks a span and this capablhty 
of optical disks span access capabrlrty An anchor point a of a span, 1s the smallest track number wlthm 
a span The largest track number wlthm this span IS a + &#38; -1 The anchor point of a span completely 
defmes the tracks of the span A number N of objects (or records) may quahfy m a query In the case of 
optical disks the number of times that the access mechamsm has to be moved for accessing the data which 
qualifies m a query IS called the spun selec- ttwty of the query Therefore, a first approxlmatlon of 
the cost of evaluatmg a query IS given by the span selectlvlty of the query A spiral scheme IS generally 
used on CLV optical disks for the storage of data rather than the concentric rmgs found on CAV disks 
The spiral consists of one long physical track of data recordings that begms on the Inner part of the 
disk and contmues until close to the outer edge of the disk where It terminates A track for our purposes 
starts from the mtersectlon of the spiral with the radial IIIII that starts at the centre of the disk 
and passes through the very begmmng of the physical splrai The track ends at llle next mtersectron wtth 
this radial lme Smce sectors are of fixed length, the radial lme may intersect the body of a sector 1 
prowded all the seeks are m one dmctmn, either mto the centre or out to the dtsk edge 287 3. Exact Solutions 
Calculating the exact solution for the expected number of spans when the span size IS equal to one track 
IS fast to compute When the span size exceeds one track the sltuatron becomes more complex as the posslblhty 
of spans covering tracks with different capacrtles must be addressed This makes the computation much 
more expensive 3.1. Span Size Equal to One Track When the size of a span IS restrlcted to one track, 
as IS the case when the access mechanism IS not equipped with a mirror, we get the followmg expression 
for the exact number of spans expected to be required to access a number of (non-crossing) objects Let 
R be the number of equal track capacity segments m the file and let t, be the number of tracks m segment 
1 let M be the object capacity of the file and let n, be the object capacity of tracks m segment I Let 
N be the number of objects selected and Then the expected retrieval cost IS given by The drvrsron m the 
above expression gives the probabrhty of one of the tracks m the I th segment not contam- mg any of the 
objects selected for retrieval, subtractmg thus from 1 gives the probablhty of one track m segment ; 
containing at least one object and requumg a span (of size one track) to retrieve rt We multrply this 
probabrhty by the number of tracks m the I fb segment to get the number of spans required to retrreve 
oblects from it,, and sum over the number of segments m the file for the final result 3.2. Span Size 
of Greater Than One Track Span sizes of more than one track Introduce the possrbrhty of having variable 
capacity tracks wlthm a span, requiring more mvolved analysis to compute an exact result For each of 
the possrble numbers of spans that could be used to retrieve a given number of objects for a file, we 
determine the probabrhtres of each being requned Thus probablhty IS determmed by computmg the number 
of object arrangements a number of spans could retrreve and drvrdmg by the total number of object arrangements 
possl- ble m the file Let T be the number of tracks m the file, N the number of oblects to be retrieved 
and M the maximum number of oblects m the file Let &#38; be thenumber of tracks m a span (the span srze), 
K the number number of spans being used to retrieve the objects and K the expected number of spans (the 
retrieval cost) Then the exact result IS grven by r I1 g= 2 K attange(l,N,Z ,K) e K 1 1 M N II In this 
formula, orrangefi,n,t,k) IS the number of object arrangements of n objects that can be retrreved by 
k spans from the t tracks that begin at track t The mam component of this process IS the determmatron 
of the number of object arrangements that a grven number of spans can be used to retrieve This problem 
IS different for non-crossmg and crossing objects, as the existence of crossing objects requrres the 
possrbrhty of a span boundary fallmg on the sector boundary crossed by an oblect, reqmrmg a second span 
to completely retrreve the object 3.2.1. Non-Crosalng Objects For non-crossmg oblects arrange IS given 
recursrvely m the followmg expressron Let Nt, be the object capa- city of track 8 and Ns,, the object 
capacrty of the span anchored at track a Then arrange(r ,n,t,k) = 0, If n = 0, n < k, lc = 0 or t < (k-1) 
&#38; + 1 288 arrange(t,n,t,k) = arrange(r+l,n,t-1,k) + mm (n Jvs,) m*n (NW*, -(1 -1)) No, _ 3 c arrange(z+Q,n--I$-Q,k-1) 
c l-l14 j-1 Where I -IS the number of retrieved objects from this span 3 - IS the index position of the 
one object that must be retrieved from first track of the span The ftrst term of arrange counts the number 
of arrangements which do not have objects located m track I that can be retrieved using the same number 
of spans The second term counts the number of arrangements that can be retrieved with the given number 
of spans that have objects located m track I The frrst summation computes the number of object arrangements 
m the file for each of the different possible numbers of objects 1 m the first span For a given value 
of I, the second summation m the term calculates the number of their arrangements wlthm the sectors of 
the span that have at least one object m the first track 3 2.2. Crossing Objects Calculatmg arrange for 
crossing objects, we must account for the posslbdlty of an oblect extending past the bounds of a span 
by crossing the boundary of the last sector m that span and requiring a second span to completely cover 
it This makes the calculation of arrange much more complex although Its expression IS similar to that 
for Non-crossing oblects It IS omitted for brevity 4. Approximate Solutions Although CLV disks are complex 
to analyze exactly, they are not so different from CAV type disks that one can rule out the success of 
extending the approximations valid for CAV disk to the CLV case The rate at which track capacity mcresses 
m CLV disks IS very slight, requiring, for example, some 1400 tracks on a CD-ROM drsk to increase the 
capacity by one sector This leads one to suspect that for oblects with sizes that are considerably smaller 
than the capacity of a track, such as non-crossing and crossing objects, the results for both types of 
disks might be fairly close We examme this posslblhty m the next section  4.1. Average CAV Approximation 
We can compute upper and lower bounds on the approximate solution to the expected number of spans required 
to cover a given number of objects on a CLV disk by computmg two correspondmg CAV solutions, one for 
a CAV disk with the same track capacity as the mmlmum found on the CLV disk and one for a CAV disk with 
the maximum found on the CLV disk For the upper bound, no CLV solution would require a larger number 
of spans since the generally larger capacity spans on the CLV disk would cover more objects so fewer 
would be required Slmdarly, for the lower bound the generally lower capacity spans on the CLV disk would 
cover fewer objects so more would be required Computing the upper and lower bounds for the case of small 
objects and 10 tracks per span, we fmd that our suspicions about the closeness of the CLV and CAV solutions 
was Justified For a CLV disk with a mmlmum track capacity of 9 sectors and a maximum capacity of 23 sectors 
(typical values for CD-ROM), an upper bound IS the CAV solution for a disk with uniform track capacity 
of 8 sectors and a lower bound IS the CAV solution for 24 sectors2 What this shows IS that d we use any 
value of track capacity (the average being a good choice) between the mmimum and maxlmum track capacities 
of a CLV disk to produce a correspondmg CAV solution, we can expect It to be very close to the desired 
CLV solution 4.2. Multiple CAV Approximation An alternate method of calculatmg the expected number of 
spans IS to use the expected distributions of objects to the equal track capacity segments of the file 
and calculate the CAV solution for each, summing the solution to produce the fmal result For R segments, 
let E, be the expected number of spans for subsegment 1, and zS be the expected number of objects that 
fall m subsegment a, then this 1s expressed as * these values are actually one more and one less than 
the maxmum and mmunum track capacltles, producmg even more extreme bounds 289 This method gives results 
for non-crossmg and crossing objects comparable to those obtamed above usmg a straight average track 
capacity Computmg the expected retrieval cost for small objects in this manner IS not as computatlonally 
efflclent as usmg a smgle CAV solution This sltuatlon IS different for computmg retrieval costs when 
objects which are large compared to the retrieval capacity of a span We examme this m the section on 
computmg the retrieval cost for large objects 4.3. Expected Spans for Non-Crossing Objects The approximate 
solution for the expected number of spans required for the retrieval of non-crossmg objects from a CAV 
disk 1s found m [3] i7 K(R) = 1+$=+7-l) Where B 1s the expected number of tracks to be retrieved The 
approximate expected number of tracks for non-crossmg objects where, t IS the number of tracks m the 
fde, n is the number of objects to be retrieved and c IS the track capacity, IS given by \ (tc -n) n 
2 1 E= b(t,n,c) = t 1 - tc n  II , 4.4. Expected Spana for Crosstng Objects For crossing oblects, the 
same formula for spans IS used but the approximate expected number of tracks 1s cal- cnlated differently 
Where EC x 6 KT -1) (2 -$)I+11 6. Large Objects (with respect to span size) When we consider the existence 
of large objects m a file, we fmd that the retneval performance for the two types of disks can differ 
considerably The number of spans required to retrieve large objects from a CAV type disk ~111 be independent 
of the ObJectis placements on the disk This IS not true for CLV type disks where the retrieval capacity 
of a span depends on its locatlon, and hence, objects stored m the outer tracks may require fewer spans 
to be retrieved then if they were stored on the inner tracks of the disk or anywhere on a comparable 
CAV type disk This IS particularly true when object size IS large with respect to the retrieval capacity 
of a span An approach to the problem of calculating the expected cost (number of spans) of retrlevmg 
a number of large oblects, IS to partltlon the file into segments of equal track/span capacity and combme 
the CAV solutions computed for each to produce a fmal result Domg so we are able to derive methods for 
producmg both exact and approximate results 5.1. Exact Solution Consider apartltlon of the tracks of 
the fde mto R segments Let M, be the object capaclt$ of each segment, 2=1,2, ,R Let N, be the number 
of oblects dlstrlbuted to each segment (c N, = N) and a=1 , NR) be the probablhtv of such a dlstrlbutlon 
P(u) = f (N,,N, Then, If each partition has a constant number of objects per track the expected number 
of spans reqmred for retnev- mg N oblects IS Where F,(U) IS the expected spans completely contamed wlthm 
segment I, and AR(U) IS a correctlon term that represents the expected number of spans selected that 
cross segment boundaries 5.2. Approximate Solutions for Large Objects An approximate solution can be 
derived using the model for the exact one presented above The computation cost can be adjusted by usmg 
less than the maxImum number of segments and calculatmg the CAV solutions for each usmg the average of 
the track capacltles m the segments This approach allows one to trade-off accuracy and com- putatlon 
cost The greater the resolution of the approxlmatlon (I e the number of segments) the greater IS the 
accu- racy of the result, but also greater 1s the number of computations required to produce It In the 
hmlt the calculation of the retrieval cost IS exact be,ause the track capacltles used wdl be the actual 
capacltles of the tracks, not an aver- age This makes the method mtultlvely very satisfactory The approxlmatlon 
IS calculated by combmmg the results for each of the possible dlstrlbutlons of the objects to the segments 
welghted by the probablhty of the dlstrlbutlon occurrmg An approxlmatlon of the expected cost then, for 
the case of large objects and for a resolution level having R seg- ments, IS given by Where E*(U) = E, 
N, + S(N,, T-(N, F, Q), olength, -(Q E, tlength,)) IS the number of spans required for the t UZ partltlon 
given the dlstrlbutlon U and olength,Es = Q tlength, I I tlength, olength, = ob3ectstze + 2 s(nttj ) 
= N _ 1 1+ span b -1) Nr,lc -1 Where z, IS the number of spans that are completely occupied by an object 
m the I Th partltlon and olength, IS the effective size of the object Half the length of one track IS 
added to the object size to account for the fact that on average an oblect will start half way mto the 
first track of the first span and so ~111 extend that much farther Into the file from the very begmnmg 
of the first span N,,,, IS the number of objects that can be retrlel ed bv one span (a function of t 
and I) and NI,~, IS the total number of objects that the fde can contam Fmallv, -1: IS the number of 
objects dlstrlbuted to the I Zh partltlon The first summation m the approxlmatlon adds the expected retrieval 
costs for each possible dlstrlbutlon U of objects to the segments of the fde welghted by the probablhty 
of the dlstrlbutlon occurrmg The second summation adds the mdlvldual costs expected for each partltlon 
given a dlstrlbutlon of objects U 291 5.3. Multiple CAV Approximation for Large Objects The usefulness 
of the multiple CAV approxlmatlon becomes apparent when employed to approximate the retrieval cost for 
large oblects Its application IS ldentlcal to that presented above for non-crossing and crossmg objects 
except that the formula used for the expected spans IS that for large objects 6. Fundamental Performance 
Tradeoffs for CLV disks  The varying track capacity found on CLV disks has some fundamental lmphcatlons 
for the placement of data and the selection of both access methods and file orgamzatlons 6.1. Sequential 
versus Random Access If a file 1s being accessed using a sequential scan the delay m retrieving data 
IS dominated by the transfer time This 1s even more SO d the disk has spiral tracks and seeks to the 
next track are transparent For such a situation, It 1s clear that the retrieval cost in terms of time 
delay 1s the same for data located on the mslde or outside tracks If the disk has concentric tracks (rare 
for CLV disks) the sequential scan will be less costly on the outside tracks because fewer seeks ~111 
be required The difference may be marginal because the cost will still be dominated by the data transfer 
time If there IS a mirror m the read head of the device, any differences (even for ConcentrIc tracks) 
may completely disappear The sltuatlon IS shghtly different when a file IS being accessed randomly Assuming 
no problems with the aval- lablhty of buffer space, we will typically allocate a buffer which IS a multiple 
of the size of a sector The random access IS then characterized by Its track selectlvlty d, which IS 
the number of tracks with qualifying objects For slm- phclty and without loss of generality we identify 
a block with a sector Let G be the number of sectors of the file If the file IS allocated m the mslde 
tracks the Nsectors ~111 be allo- cated m many different tracks Therefore, many more moves of the access 
mechanism may be required for the retrieval of all the qualifying sectors Since the seek time dominates 
by far the data transfer times for the case of random access, the cost of accessing the data from the 
outside tracks 1s less The graph m Figure 1 below Illustrates the difference m the number of movements 
of the access mechanism for equal sized files located on the mner and outer tracks The ratio of the costs 
will depend upon the selectivity of the queries Note that rotational delays for a single record access 
per track will be greater for the file m the outslde tracks At the same time the average distance trav- 
eled by the access mechanism will be less m the outside tracks Both factors are less Important than the 
number of times that the access mechanism moves and their effect tends to cancel out The above discussion 
leads us to two conclusions Firstly, the placement of a sequentially accessed file on Inside or outside 
tracks of a CLV disk ~111 not affect the retrieval performance slgnlflcantly However, the opposite IS 
true for randomly accessed fdes whose choice of placement on the mslde or outslde tracks of a CLV disk 
~111 significantly affect the retrieval performance of accesses from those flies In particular placement 
of the randomly accessed file on the outside tracks of the disk gives better retrieval performance As 
a result files which are accessed randomly should be placed towards the outside tracks of the CLV disk, 
while files that are accessed sequentially should be placed m the mslde tracks of the disk Secondly, 
between two randomly accessed flies of the same characterrstlcs (e g record lengths, file sizes, selec- 
tlvlty of retrievals), the one with the highest frequency of use should be placed on the outer tracks 
to realize hrgher savmgs in retrieval costs These results give us crlterla for decldmg upon the different 
tradeoffs of file placement Let g be the number of objects (records) per block (sector) Let M be the 
number of records of the file Let f be the frequency of queries on the file (e g the number of queries 
per umt of time) Then the cost of retrieval per umt of time IS / tracks(M,N,g,Zoc) Where lot IS the startmg 
locatron of the file (track number of the first track, assummg that the most mslde track IS track I), 
and tracks for the case of span size equal to one track is given m sectlon 3 1 G.ven two randomly accessed 
flies, F,, characterized by fl, M1, N1, 91, and FQ, characterized by fz, M,, Nz, g2, and a startmg track

only If fl tracks(MJV~,gJoc) + f2 traclcs(M2,N2,g2,zoc2) < f2tracks(M2,N2,gl,10c) + j,trac~s(M1,Nl,gl,locl)

given by the formula for calculatmg the spiral track lengths 7. Conclusion Our analysis shows the derivations 
of exact and approximate formulas for the expected number of spans required to retrieved a given number 
of objects from files stored on CLV type optical disks The analytic techmques developed are needed for 
a variety of performance studies such as file orgamzations, query optlmlzatron, etc For the case of computmg 
the cost of retrieving objects (both non-sector boundary crossing and sector boundary crossing ) that 
are small compared to the capacity of a span, we have shown that the CAV solution for an equivalent file 
hav- mg a uniform track capacity equal to the average of the file on the CLV disk IS very close When 
objects are large m size compared to the capacity of a span, we have shown that an approach employmg 
multiple CAV solutions and the expected dlstrlbutlon of objects across the file on the CLV disk produces 
good results and 1s fast to compute (our results have been verified against simulation) [5] We also discussed 
some fundamental lmphcatlons of the nonumform track capacltles characterlstlc of CLV disk on the placement 
of files and showed that, m general, files with the greatest frequency of random accesses should be located 
on the outer tracks of the disk The performance difference of alternative placements was shown to be 
very slgmflcant for files whrch are randomly accessed 8. References [I] Bell, A, Marrello, V , Magnetic
