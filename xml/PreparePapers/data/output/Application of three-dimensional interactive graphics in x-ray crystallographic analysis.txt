 APPLICATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS IN X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHICANALYSIS by S. D. 
 A program called XpY was written for the PDP-10/LDS-1 at the Princeton University Computer Graphics 
Laboratory, for generating and displaying models of dinucleoside phosphates. The molecule GpC, a member 
of this class and a fragment of the nucleic acid RNA, was subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis. The 
paper describes the importance of model building inX-ray analysis, and shows step by step how XpY was 
used to deduce the atomic coordinates of GpC from the experimental data. The program documentation is 
also included as an Appendix. A subjective critique of graphics is made in the Conclusions section.
