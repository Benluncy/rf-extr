 1971 AFIPS Information Processing Personnel Survey Robert Dickmann U.S. Department of Labor A primary 
difficulty in conducting a survey is in get- ting a representative sample. Gathering data on Infor- 
mation Processing personnel is further complicated by the lack of one professional society to go to 
for a membership list, standardized educational requirements which would allow you to access by degree 
or standard- ized job titles which would allow surveying through organizations where they are employed. 
Although several governmental organizations gather data on Information Processing personnel, most of 
the data is incomplete and the names and addresses, if available, are confiden- tial. The alternative 
chosen for this survey was a sampling of the membership lists of the professional societies encompassing 
the Information Processing field. The Sample AFIPS sponsored a similar survey in 1968, mailing questionnaires 
to all members (69,751) of the AFIPS con- stituent societies, and receiving responses from 29,826. I 
mention this in that I will be referring to the 1968 survey for comparison purposes. For the 1971 survey, 
costs demanded a sampling technique. Every fifth name on the membership lists of 13 professional societies 
was sent the questionnaire. In addition, attendees at the 1970 FJCC who were not affiliated with a professional 
society were sent the questionnaire in order to broaden the representation of the sample. We received 
8,417 responses from a total of 23,089 questionnaires mailed, with approximately 11% of the responses 
being from those not affiliated with a professional society. The profes- sional societies represented 
included ACM, DP~A, IEEE-CS, ASA, SIAM, etc. Several new questions were added which were felt to be valuable 
for developing future trend data, as AFIPS hopes to continue the survey periodically. The number of 
questionnaires mailed to the membership of each participating society was designed to elicit a sample 
which could be considered statistically compar- able to those obtained in the 1968 survey. There is not 
sufficient time to cover all the data contained in the survey, so I will concentrate on those items I 
feel would be of most interest to the SIGCPR membership. Copies of the survey may be obtained directly 
from AFIPS. 23- 22.6~ 22- 21 20.1% 20 ;9 i6. 17- .!6.2' fG- f5- 14- . ,5- o ~ H z I0 9' I1" 7" 6" 5.9%

 Chart I gives the distribution of the survey population by agO. It is interesting to note that in 1968 
the median age found in the survey was 34, and in 1971 the median abe was 37. In the three years from 
1968 to 1971 the median age of the survey population has risen a like number of years. At first this 
may seem reason- able; however, this is a rather sharp rise considerina that this is a large population 
which still attracts many new and young members which should tend to hold the average age to a slow rise. 
 I found the responses to the questions on sex and race to be most interesting. The distribution of males 
and females (Chart 2) remained nearly constant since 1968, when the responses were 87% male, 8% female, 
and 5% no report. Lower "no report" percentages generally mean that we have less ambiguous, or clear 
questions. Why we still obtain 2.1% "no report" for this question I will leave for ~asters and Johnson. 
 The question regarding race was not asked in the previous questionnaire, so there is no comparable data.

No Report 2.l% shows that 94.8% of the respondents indicated their race as Caucasian, 2.1% Oriental, 
.6% Spanish/American, and .5% Negro. There had been considerable discussion regarding the advisability 
of including this question for fear that the intent would be misinterpreted. We were pleased that we 
did not receive any objections to the question, and that the percentage of "no report" was only 1.2%. 
The percentages for other than Caucasian are strikingly low for the Information Processing profession 
which has presented itself as being very open as far as job opportunities. Even combining the percentage 
Not Reporting with the percentages for other than Caucasian, the total is only 4.7%. The relatively small 
percentage of females in the profession is also disconcertinG. These small percentages for minorities 
and females may be accounted for only to a small degree by the bias of the sample being limited to members 
of a professional society or attendees at a professional conference. I Molter  J 3o o./. BOchelor 35.4%

to the results found on the 1968 survey, shows higher percentages for those possessing ~aster and Doctorate 
degrees. The present survey shows 12.6% with Ph.D.'s compared to 7.5% and 30% with a ~aster's degree 
compared to 24% in 1968. Where the 1968 survey indica- ted 28.7% not possessing any college-level degree, 
the present survey indicates fewer than 18%. It should be noted, however, that in this chart we are showing 
the distribution by highest degree regardless of the rele- vancy of the degree to Information Processing.

 In Chart 5 we asked for information on the source of Information Processing training. Here again, this 
was a new question so there is no comparable data for 1968. Respondents could list more than one source 
of training which accounts for the percentages adding to more than 100%. Nanufacturer's Customer Training 
shows the high- est percentage with 47.1% indicating that it was at least one source of their training, 
with In-house train- ing a close second with 44.5%. With the "unbundling" and the increase in the number 
of University-offered courses, we would expect to see the importance of Uni- versity and College training 
increasing by the next survey. Only 19.2% responded positively that they were licensed or had a professional 
certificate. 70.4% reported that they were not, and 10.4% did not respond. The distribu- tion was as 
follows, Number of Respondents Certificate in Data Processing 593 Certified Public Accountant 213 
 Professional Engineer 505 Other 326 Emplo2ment The number of years of experience in the information 
processing field is shown in Chart 6. In 1968, 40% had over eight years of experience, as compared to 
46.6% in the present survey. CHART 6 Years of Experience in the Information Processing Field 26' 24"

in the previous survey were used as measures of mobility within the pro-fession. The first asked respondents 
to indicate the length of their service in their present organization. Chart 7 shows that 38.6% of the 
respondents had over six years with their present organization. This compares with 41% in 1968. The 
second question on mobility asked the respondent to report the number of organizations worked for full-time 
since entering the Information Processing field. Chart 8 indicates the 32.8% had only one employer, 
57.1% had two or less employers, and 73.5% had three or less employers since entering the Information 
Processing field. This is a pretty good record compared to many other professions, and it would appear 
that a small percentage has given a high turnover reputation to the profession. Of the sample, 60.2% 
of the respondents indicated that in their employer's organizational chart they were indi- cated as holding 
a supervisory position. The number of people supervised is indicated in Chart 9. Chart l0 gives salary 
distribution for the survey popula- tion. Complete salary data and comparison will be in- cluded in the 
final report of the survey, to be avail- able through AFIPS later this year. Chart 8 Number of Employers
