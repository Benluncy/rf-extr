 ON THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNIZING ZERO S. C. Johnson Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated Murray 
Hill, New Jersey Abstract The problem of recognizing when a com- plicated mathematical expression equals 
zero has great importance in symbolic mathematics. This paper gives two algorithms which can be applied 
to many such problems, and discusses two concrete examples. The algorithms are based on the recogni- 
tion that many interesting functions (such as exponentlation) are eigenvectors of well studied transformations 
(such as differentia- tion). I. Introduction The problem of dealing with general mathematical expressions 
by $omputer2has been intensively studied. Brown, Â± Moses, and Risch o all define environments in which 
some success can be obtained in doing arithmetic operations and integration within certain classes of 
functions. On the other hand, Richardson 4 and Cavlness5 have shown that the problem of recognizing when 
a mathematical expression is identically zero is undecidable for certain other classes of functions. 
 The aim of this paper is to state and prove two algorithms which can be applied to many such problems, 
and to discuss several con- crete examples. The algorithms are concerned with deciding when complex mathematical 
expressions are identically zero. This problem is important in symbolic mathematics for several reasons: 
 (I) Formal division by an expression equal zero can lead to incorrect results. to (2) Subexpresslons 
equal to zero tend to proliferate exponentially if not found and removed. (3) The general problem of 
simplification is closely connected with the problem of recognizing zero. The algorithms will be stated 
in a general mathematical context. This leads to some difficulties of exposition, as the lan- guage of 
vector spaces is not well adapted to dealing with questions of effective comput- ability and algorithm 
definition. Whenever there was a conflict between mathematical rigor and clarity of exposition, an attempt 
was made to yield to clarity. 2. Theory This section is devoted to some vector space theory which will 
be applied to the remaining sections. The reader may find it profitable to read this section in parallel 
with the next two sections. We shall assume that K is a field whose structure is known completely for 
our purposes. In particular, we shall assume that we can recognize zero in K. We shall also assume 
a commutative ring R which contains K, and a mapping @ : R ~ R. Definition: An element u ~ R, u ~ O, 
is an eigenvector of ~ if there is an element a c K with ~(u) = an. a is called the eigenvalue of u. 
 We shall denote by E the set of elgen- vectors of ~. At this point, we need to make a practical convention; 
when we write u c E, we shall mean that we know not only u but also its elgen- value. This has considerable 
practical importance, since the elgenvalue is in K, which we assume is well known. Throughout the following, 
we will assume that @ satisfies these three axioms: Axiom I: ~(u+v) = ~(u) + ~(v), all u,v ~ R Axiom 
2: ~(K) C K, and ~(i) = 0 Axiom 3: If u e E, then u is invertible and u -I e E. If u,v c E, then vue 
E. Recall that Axiom 3 implies, not merely that we know that u -1 and uv are elgenvectors, but also 
that we can construct their elgenvalues. We now draw some simple consequences from the axioms, which 
can be quickly proved by the interested reader. Axiom 1 implies that ~(0) = 0. Moreover, Axiom 2 implies 
that every nonzero element of K is an eigenvector. By Axiom 3, we thus deduce that  KE C E ~ {0}, and 
thus Thus, if u is an eigenvector, ~(u) is either 0 or another eigenvector, whose elgenvalue can be 
computed. Moreover, if ~(u) = 0 then the eigenvalue associated with u must be 0. Thus we can decide, 
for any eigenvector, whether ~(u) = 0 just by examining the elgenvalue. The set of all u in R with ~(u) 
= 0, the kernel of ~ (denoted ker(~)), is of central importance in this work. Notice that every nonzero 
element of ker(~) is an eigenvector with elgenvalue = O. There is no necessary  324 relationship, however, 
between ker(~) and K except that they both contain I. We now describe the first zero recogni- tion algorithm: 
 Algorithm I Suppose we have some algorithm for decid- ing, given u e ker(qp), if u = 0. Then, given 
 n a sum S = ~ ui, with u i e E, i = l,...,n, i=l we may decide if S = 0 as follows: Step I: If n = 
I, then S @ O. Return. Step 2: If n > I, then compute T = ~(S/Un) and test it for zero. (See details 
below.) Step 3: If T ~ 0 then S ~ 0. Return. Step 4: If T = 0, then S/u n e ker(~). By assumption, we 
can test if S/u n = 0. Step 5: If S/u n ~ 0, then S ~ O. Return. Step 6: If S/u n = 0, then S = 0o Return. 
It remains to explain step 2. We have: n S/u n = ~ ui/Un i=l n-I = i + ~ ui/u n i=l By Axiom 3, 
we may find the elgenvalues bl,...,bn_ I for ui/u n. If any of the b i are O, delete the corresponding 
terms of the sum. If all the b i are zero, then T = ~(S/un) = O. Otherwise T is a sum of at most n - 
1 eigen- vectors with known eigenvalues, and we may apply algorithm 1 recursively to decide whether T 
= 0. We may in fact go even farther in this direction. Suppose, as above, that we can decide when elements 
of ker(qp) are zero. Let Ai,...,An E R have the property that qp(A ) e E ~{0}, i = I ..... n. (Note that 
all i elements of E have this property.) Then we may use the following algorithm to decide if n S 
= ~ A i is zero: i=l Algorithm 2 Use Algorithm I to decide if n q~(S) = }i q~(Ai) is zero. If qp(S) 
@ 0 then  i=l S @ O. If qp(S) = O, then S is in ker(qp), so we can decide if it is zero by assumption. 
 Clearly, this process may be extended to n  allow us to decide when a sum ~ A i is i=l zero, provided 
only that each A i can be trans- formed to a finite sum of elgenvectors by a finite number of applications 
of qp. 3. An Application  Let R be a field, and let ~ be a derivation on R; that is, ~ satisfies: 
(i) Addition Law: ~(a+b) = ~(a) + ~(b)  (2) Multiplication Law: ~(ab) = a~(b) + b~(a)   The most common 
case of a derivation is when R is a field of infinitely differentiable functions, and ~ is differentiation. 
 Let K be a subfield of R with ~(K) C K. Then we have Theorem: The axioms of section two hold for ~. 
 Proof: Axiom i is precisely the addition law. -~x~f~m 2 follows because ~(K) C K and  ~(l.1) = 1.~(1) 
+ 1.~(1) or ~(1) = ~(1) + ~(1) SO  ~(i) = o. Axiom 3 requires a bit of computation. Let u and v be 
eigenvectors with eigenvalues a and b. Then ~(uv) = ~(u)v + u~(v) = (a+b)uv ~(u -I) = -u-2~(u) = _u-2au 
  = (-a)u -I Thus uv and u -I are eigenvectors, and we can compute their eigenvalues. The eigenvectors 
of ~ are a very inter- esting class of functions. They include (1) Rational functions.  (2) aeb~ with 
a and b rational functions.  (3) b ~, with b a rational function and a any real number.  Algorithm 
2 enables us to deal with functions A such that ~(A) is an elgenvector; that is, indefinite integrals 
of eigenvectors. Thus we may include functions such as (4) log b, b a rational function.  325 (5) 
arctan x, arcsin x. x 2  (6) erf(x) = ~ e -x dx.  0 and many more. The larger the class of functions 
examined, the larger ker(~) is likely to be; this problem will be discussed in the next section. 4. 
Recognizing When an Element of ker(~) is 0 The algorithms in Section 2 both depend strongly on being 
able to tell when an element of ker(~) is in fact zero. When ~ is a derivation, ker(~) is usually called 
the field of constants. When ~ is ordinary differentiation, an element of ker(~) must be constant on 
every interval on which it is defined. Thus we can frequently replace the problem of deciding when a 
constant func- tion is zero by the problem of deciding when a constant expression, obtained by substitution, 
is zero. (As done in (4)7. For example, in the application of algorithm I we might find that differentiation 
of e 2x - eX.e x yields O. The problem is then to decide if e 2x - eX.e x e ker(~) is zero. Since all 
the functions are continuous and defined on the real~ne, the constant function is identically zero if 
and 0nly if it attains the value zero at the point x = O. Using the formula e 0 = I, we see that the 
expression is in fact zero. In general, the algebrale, or evene linea ~ independence of numbers such 
as e, ~, e , and so on, Is not mathematically established at this time. Thus in many practical systems 
one is forced to make approximations or assump- tions, and take the resultant risk (hopefully very small) 
of obtaining incorrect results based on incomplete mathematical knowledge. One example is the work of 
Brown, ~ where ~ and e were conjectured to be independent in a stronger sense than algebraically independent 
in order to obtain a simplification algorithm. Thus a failure of Brown's algorithm implies a very important 
mathematical theorem! An alternative approach might involve approximate evaluation of the constant function 
at a num- ber of points using interval arithmetic, which would indicate immediately in most cases when 
the result was not identically O. Constant functions which appeared to be 0 in all of these tests might 
be printed out, and then assumed to be 0 in later calculations. 5. Another Application Let F be a field 
of rational functions over the integers. Let K be the field of rational functions over F in one variable 
m. Let R be a field of functions from the non- negative integers to F such that R includes K. Define 
~ : R ~ R as ~(u)(m) = u(m+l) - u(m), u e R, m any integer that is, ~ is the first difference function. 
 We define  326 Definition: A function u(m) e R is  factential if there is a rational function a(m) 
with u(m+l) = a(m)u(m) Note that 2 m, m!, and (m) are factential, but 2 m + I and (m2)! are noB. The 
name "facten- tial" describes the fact that both factorial and exponential functions are factential. 
 We leave to the reader the following simple proposition. Theorem: (I) All rational functions are factential. 
 (2) Factential functions are closed under the operations of taking inverses and multi- plication. 
 (37 The nonzero factential functions are pre- cisely the eigenvectors of ~; if u(m+l) = a(m)u(m), then 
the eigenvalue of u is a(m) - I. (4) $ satisfies the three axioms. (57 ker($) = F C K, since if u e 
ker($), u(m) = u(O) s F, for all m. Because ker(~) is a rational function field over the rational numbers, 
we may tell immediately when an element of ker(~) is zero. Thus algorithm 1 can be used to allow us to 
tell when sums of factentlals are identically zero. Moreover, algorithm 2 allows us to deal with functions 
  m-I A(m) = >: u(i) i=O where u(m) is factential, since ~(A) = u(m). 6. An Example A short example 
of factential function simplification should give the flavor of the application of these algorithms. 
 {Tn-I i/ We shall show that \ f-J2i-O - 2n +I= S(n) is identically O. We use only that (a) 2 n+l = 
2-2 n (The factential definition)  (b) 2 o = 1 Applying algorithm 2, we have T(n) = ~(S(n)) = 2 n 
-(2-1)2 n + (I-I) = 2 n _ 2 n Being particularly stupid, we treat this as a sum of two eigenvectors. 
Applying algorithm I, we have   ~/T(n)h : ~(i) /2nh 2 n --is an eigenvector of ~, whose eigenvalue 
 2 n can be computed knowing only the eigenvalue of 2 n 2 n. The eigenvalue of ~ is in fact 0. Thus 
/ h : T(n) 2 n ~ T(n). O, so = I -is in ker(9); \ 2 n / 2 n and T(n) T(O) 2 0 1 ----~--= i-= I ---= 
O. 2 n ~'2~ 2q~ 1 Thus T(n) is identically O, so S(n) e ker(~). Thus, as before S(n) e S(O) m 0 - 
i + I = 0 Thus S(n) is identically O. 7. An Open Problem Sums such as m-I  f u(i), i=O  with u(i) 
factential, are of some practical use; however, it would be much more interest- ing if m could appear 
inside the summation as well as being a limit. For example, in the last section we proved m-I 2 m - 
I = f 2 i i=O but we cannot prove m i=O Most of the interesting binomial identi- ties are of this 
second type. This problem seems very difficult. For example, examine m-I S(m) = f u(m,i) i=O with 
u(m,i) rational in m and i. Then for which functions u is S rational? Clearly if there is a rational 
function v(m,i) with  v(m,i+l) v(m,i) : u(m,i) then m-I  S(m) = f (v(m,i+l) -v(m,i)) = v(m,m) -v(m,O) 
 i=O  is rational. We conjecture that S(m) is rational if and only if there is such a rational v(m,i); 
a general proof seems quite difficult. Special cases of this problem include inquiring if, for any rational 
function u(m), the functions m-I m-I m-I Z i+u , f V77 7 ' or f i=O i=O i=O i2+u(m) are rational. 
A number of methods have been successful in these cases and others, however. References  I. Brown,
