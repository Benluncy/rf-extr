SCAN DEVICES by d. Kajiya and M. Ullner Computer Science Department California Institute of Technology 
Ahstract. Recently several investigators have studied the problem of displaying text characters on grey 
level raster scan displays. Despite arguments suggesting that grey level displays are equivalent to very 
high resolution bitmaps, the performance of grey level displays has been disappointing. This paper will 
show that much of the problem can be traced to inappropriate antialiasing procedures. Instead of the 
classical (sin x)/x filter, the situation calls For a filter with characteristics matched hath to the 
nature of display on CRTs and to the human visual system. We give examl)les to illustrate the problems 
of the existing melhods and the advantages of the new methods. Although the techniques are described 
in terms of text, the results have application to the general antialiasing problem--at least in theory 
if not in practice. I. INTRODUCTION lhe computer age nearly destroyed quality printed and displayed text. 
Many of us remember our First sight of the ugly, uneven impression of a high speed chain printer. At 
the time, it seemed inevitable that high technology would sweep more beautiful--and less utilitarian--methods 
of text display aside for all but the most premium of uses. Recently this prospect has changed. With 
the growing availability of raster scan displays we have witnessed a technology with the capability of 
generating alphanumeric text that is more than just readable but pleasant to view as well. It is an exciting 
dream of men like Donald Knuth to be able to compose locally and transmit for publication high quality 
text containing multiple fonts and mathematical equations. This dream would be made more attractive if 
an author would be able to see the result immediately, rather than having to wait several days for the 
output of a $100,000 machine. The ideal would be to close the loop: to make available to the author an 
inexpensive real time device able to display high performance images. Permission to copy without fee

otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission. Furthermore, the effect of high 
quality real time displays on the activities of computer science itsel.F has yet to he accurately assessed. 
But--aside from the creation of the word processing industry--the introduction of expanded codes to include 
relatively mundane Features such as lower case characters has tremendously changed the flavor if not 
the substance of programmin(t: surely none of us would wish i:o return to the 5-hit Baudot code! More 
importantly, the astonishing power and economy of computer languages and mathematical notations which 
incorporate special symbols (such as APL and symbolic logic) certainly has hidden lessons for the computer 
science community. Many researchers soon discovered that the problem of displaying synthetically generated 
images on raster scan devices was a nontrivial task [Crow 1976, aline 1979]. lhe so called aliasing prohlem 
was encountered due to the high frequency content of artificially synthesized images, lhese researchers 
developed methods to overcome this problem which can he viewed alternatively as interpolation of brightnesses 
between pixels or filtering with a triangular convolution kernel. We shall, for definiteness, refer to 
this popular scheme as triangular Filtering. lhe First attempts to display text on raster scan devices 
used these intuitive filtering schemes that worked surprisingly well in practice [Warnock Ig80, Seitz]. 
It is the aim of this paper to analyze the performance of these schemes For the general image case as 
well as the text case. We also propose a new method for choosing the pixel values which make up a synthetic 
image, show some preliminary results, and finally discuss the future directions that this research may 
take. By now, th~ aliasing problem for computer generated images is well known to all in the field, as 
arc the frequency domain interpretation of the phenomenon and the first order approximation to its solution. 
We wish to examine i~ detail the performance of this first order approximation, It is well known that 
the triangular filtering algorithm is cheap, fast, easy to implement, and produces an adequate antialiased 
image for very many applications. There are other applications, however, that require higher performance. 
Text is just such an application. Characters consist almost entirely of sharp edges and contain small 
subl)ixel features, such as serifs. Also, the processing of text can be done orfline and the result 
stored in permanent memory. The method we present here is expensive, slow, and relatively hard to implement, 
but it produces higher quality images than the usual triangular filtering scheme. It is not now suitable 
for real time, or near real time, raster display applications. &#38;#169;1981 ACM O-8971-045-1/81-0800-0007 
$00.75 Computer Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 It should be emphasized that these methods and 
analyses are applicable--at least in theory--to the general problem of antialiasing arbitrary images. 
We have chosen to focus on the display of text rather than arbitrary graphic objects because certain 
computational advantages accrue due to the small size of characters. If the computational implementations 
of these methods currently were not economically impracticable we would be reporting on the general synthetic 
image display problem as well. 2. AN ANALYSIS OF POPULAR ANTIAI_IASING SCIIEHES LINEAR FILTERING WITH 
A TRIANGULAR PSF. This section will analyze how well the triangular filtering algorithm does in removing 
aliasing while not otherwise distorting the picture. The details of the development are necessarily mathematical, 
but we present the key ideas here for those who want an overview of the section. There are two primary 
sources of error in the triangular filtering scheme. (I) The triangle interpolation kernel is not an 
ideal low pass filter and passes frequencies that are beyond the Nyquist limit. Thus, it is subject to 
aliasing. (2) The interpolation kernel does not take into account the reconstruction kernel. That is, 
it ignores the fact that pixels on the CRT display are Gaussian spots. The Gaussian spots are not ideal 
Iowpass filters either and given the usual focus setting the the frequency response of the reconstruction 
is far from flat. flow well does the usual scheme work? The answer depends, of course, on the nature 
of the images displayed, and the mathematics tells you how to calculate the answer for your image. The 
gist of the answer, though, is that for certain images like t.ext, there is plenty of room for improvement. 
lhe most popular scheme for antialiasing is to linearly filter the input signal with some sort of interpolation 
kernel [Schafer and Rabiner 1973, Oetken, et. al. |975]. We focus on the case of artificial images such 
as text and computer generated calligraphic and halftone images for display on raster scan frame buffers. 
There is some controversy about the characteristics of the optimum interpolation kernel with respect 
to the amount of ringing, and whether negative lobes are desirable [Gabriel 1977]. Many workers have 
settled on a triangular interpolation kernel as a simple compromise that gives good results in practice 
and is easy to compute [Crow 1976, Warnock 1980]. In the interest of concreteness we shall restrict the 
ensuing analysis to the triangular interpolation case; however, the reader can readily discern that the 
arguments involved are quite general. Parts of this analysis are similar to those found in [Pratt 1978]. 
The triangular PSF is shown in Figure 1 and is given by the equation: To perform the sampling and reconstruction 
we convolve the ideal image with the interpolation kernel, sample with raster pitch T, and reconstruct 
by convoIving the sampled signal with the reconstruction kernel. As is well known, these steps are best 
visualized in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of k(~), the triangular kernel, is K(~) as 
shown in Figure 2. This is compared with the ideal Nyquist kernel of sin(F-jv"F)/{~/f~. The analytic 
expression for K(cO) is lhis figtire clearly shows a possible source of aliasing error allowed by this 
kernel. Namely for an input image f(~) with Fourier transform F(ua) the root mean square aliasing energy 
is given by D Now if F has most of its energy concentrated in the low frequencies then the aliasing error 
energy is quite Small since the two terms in Equation (2.1) are roughly the same. Unfortunately, most 
artificial images, and especially text, have a Fourier spectrum that resides almost exclusively in the 
high frequency portions of signal space. To get some idea of the energy error involved, let us take a 
"line source", viz. a line of delta functions. This situation is to be met, for example, in the very 
thin strokes of classic Roman capitals, and in the diagonal strokes of a capital A for the Bodoni typeface. 
In this case f(~) approaches a Dirac delta function whose Fourier transform, in turn, approaches a flat 
spectrum. Equation (2.1) then gives fÂ° F or ~-~ J-~ the relative aliasing energy is roughly E (lJ+l'~ 
( i"i'l. J6). To perform the sampling step in the frequency domain we merely replicate the signal at 
the sampling frequency. Assume we have already folded in all the aliasing energy so that our modified 
signal appears as in Figure 3. Sampling now replicates this modified signal to something shown in Figure 
4. Now we can reconstruct the signal by passing it through a reconstruction filter. If the reconstruction 
kernel is the Nyquist kernel, then the signal is a low pass filtered version of the original. However, 
in this matter we are not free to exercise a choice for our reconstruction kernel, except for a very 
limited range. The reconstruction kernels available to us are fixed by the physics of the output devices 
at our disposal, whether they be electrostatic printer, COM devices, or CRT based displays. To take the 
most common example, it is well known that the spot luminance distribution for a CRT is Gaussian, the 
variance of which is set by the focusing. At the proper focus point, a flat-field raster just becomes 
smooth, this is given roughly at the point where ~ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian, Computer 
Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 Now, the Fourier transform of this reconstruction kernel is 
Thus the Final output signal looks more like Figure 5 instead of appearing as in the normal case. In 
this picture we can see two sources of error arising from the mismatch of triangular and Gaussian kernel: 
Imaging errors and equalization errors. Imaging errors are produced by the leakage of spurious copies 
of the original signal. This is given by When the Gausslan spot Is focused properly this error is quite 
small. (Otherwise a flat field wouldn't have appeared flat.) By far the more serious error is caused 
by the mismatch between the triangle and Gaussian frequency responses. Let us for the-moment ignore the 
effects of aliasing and imaging, say by attempting to display an already perfectly bandlimited signal 
on a properly focused display (0-=T/.66). In this case the overall modulation transfer function, is given 
by lhis curve is plotted on a dB scale in Figure 6. Note that for the higher Frequencies the MTF is down 
by almost 10 (IB! Clearly, this amount of attenuation is causing a significant amount of sharpness loss, 
particularly in the Fine features of high quality fonts. Thtls, if one is constrained to use to the linear 
Filtering approach, a high frequency preemphasis is clearly called for--at the expense of an increased 
aliasing error tradeoff. OTHER KERNELS Many ad hoc schemes besides linear filtering have been proposed. 
Many are equivalent to linear filtering with triangular or other kernels. These include proportional 
weighting of the area of a given pixel covered, trapezoidal decomposition, contour smoothing, and nearest 
neighbor schemes. One may wonder if the above remarks apply to all interpolation kernels as well as the 
triangle. Furthermore, there are a wealth of possible nonlinear schemes that come to mind. One can imagine 
an Edison-type programme involving a massive amount of experiment in order to converge on the correct 
solution. There is, however, a non ad hoe approach that is closely related to the roots of the Whittaker-Shannon 
sampling theorem, from which the original frequency domain analysis is derived. 3. OPTIMLIM LINEAR SAMPLING 
AND RECONSTRUCTION Instead of choosing an arbitrary kernel and calctilating its performance, in this 
section we present an approach that calculates the optimum linear antialiasing filter for a given output 
restoration kernel. It turns out that this method has a Flaw which is corrected in the next section. 
The flaw is that images with negative outputs will be generated. In a way, we mny think of the image 
sampling and reconstruction procedure as an function approximation pr'oi}lem. We are given as basis functions 
the Gaussian spots on a CRT. The question we may pose then is: "What are the optimum weights to linearly 
combine the basis vectors for approximation of the ideal signal?" In other words, we are free to vary 
the brightness of each pixel spot (which is a Gaussian distribution) in order to make the reconstructed 
signal as "close" to the original ideal image as possible. In a CRT, the reconstructed image is given 
by a weighted sum of Gaus.sian bumps: go In this equation, x~ represents the pixel value, and gi(~) 
represents a Gaussian distribution centered at the i ~k pixel. See Figure 7. Each Gaussian is a shifted 
version of a canonical bump: Now the question is. how do we measure the closeness of two images? Namely, 
given two images how do we assign a non-negative real number which corresponds to the distance between 
them? The choice of such a distance metric is a nontrivial task--a choice on which the ultimate visual 
quality of the images is strongly influenced. We will discuss the choice of other image metrics based 
on the human visual system below, but for now we choose a particular metric which has many pleasing analytic 
(if not visual) properties, the mean square metric. The distance between two images f~, ~ is given by 
The sampling problem may now be stated thus: Given an input image f(~), what are the optimum pixel values 
x i minimizing the error between th~ original image and the reconstructed image? That is, find the values 
..... x~, xo, x i .... minimizing _ i=-~o Now, in practice, there are only a finite number of sample 
points to be determined, say xa, xc,...,x~_ I . In order to minimize this functional we take its gradient 
and set it to zero.  Computer Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 This give rise to a system of 
equations Thus, the operation may be very roughly interpreted as follows: pm ~-t : or Doing a little 
algebra we obtain: ,do gO i=O -re Now we use the identity (2.2) to get ~'=o The quantities on both sides 
of this equation have names, where R~((i-k)T) is the autocorrelation Function of the Ga(~ssian spot evaluated 
at the point (i-k)T. The quantity on the left is simply Rfa(kT) the cross correlation of f and g at kT. 
7J Setting R_q((i-k)T)=alk" and R fzl(kT)=bj~ the above normal equations take the familial'form Ax=b. 
 Where A is an n n matrix called the Gram matrix and b is an n-dimensional column vector, where n is 
the number of pixels in the output. The optimum pixel values are then given by the solution of this system 
of equations. It is well known that the autocorrelation matrix A is of the so called symmetric Toeplitz 
form, viz. it is constant along the major diagonals. There exist fast methods to invert such matrices 
[Levinson 1947, Trench 1964]. These stem from the fact that there are not really n~ independent elements 
but rather n. Inversion with the Le~inson-Trench scheme is O(n 2-) instead of the Usual n -~ . Note that 
in the 2-dimensional case the matrix is no longer Toeplitz but rather Block Toeplitz, with Toeplitz sub-blocks, 
thus enabling significant economies in the storage and computation of the solution vectors [Kajiya 1981]. 
These savings can be quite significant since For a picture n pixels square, the foll Gram matrix requires 
n ~r elements and take time O(n (e) time to solve, for n=512 the straightforward inversion scheme is 
well beyond the capabilities of even the largest of computers, while the Levinson-Trench recursion is 
quite practical. It may seem that for text character fonts, much of this discussion is moot since characters 
are quite small, say lOx13 pixels. However, even for this size, the matrices have 16900 elements, and 
for a 30~30 pixel font the full autocorrelation matrix requires almost a million entries! An important 
point concerns the reconstruction kernels. If they were not Gaussians as in a CRT but rather Nyquist 
kernels as in the ideal case, then the Sampling theorem obtains. The Gram autocorrelation matrix reduces 
to the identity due to the orthonormality of the Nyquist kernels, and the cross correlation step corresponds 
to a perfect lowpass filtering and sampling operation. To reconstrtlct with a given waveForm, first filter 
by that waveform (take the inner product) then solve the matrix problem with the Gram matrix of autocorrelations. 
If the matrix is large we may be able to ignore edge effects and consider the matrix simply as a convolution 
with the "Green's function" of the Gram operator, which serves as an equalizing filter to flatten the 
response of the initial filter. Thus, the above process is a linear process and, we might add, one that 
is quite familiar in certain circles. It is, however, inadequate from several standpoints. The two major 
inadequacies are, first, positivity constraints stemming from the physics of light and the physics of 
the display devices and, second, the inadequacy of the least square image metric as a suitable model 
for vision. In the next section we discuss the first of these shortcomings, while in a later section 
we treat the second. 4. TilE POSITIVITY CONSTRAINT In this section we analyze the cause of the negative 
lobes output by the optimum linear filter. We also explore methods For correcting the negative lobe output. 
It turns out that the obvious method of truncating the negative lobes at zero may or may not work, depending 
upon the form of the restoration kernel. We analyze the criteria under which truncation works. Unfortunately, 
for the case of interest, viz. Gaussian reconstruction kernels, the criteria are not met. Figure 8 shows 
the minimum mean square error reconstruction of an impulse using Gaussian reconstruction kernels. The 
relative extrema represent the strongest contributions of each individual Gaussian spot. This response 
can be couched in almost teleological terms as follows: To make an impulse with a series of Gaussian 
bumps, take an initial bump and shave off the sides to narrow the bump by subtracting a small Gaussian 
from either side. Now to compensate for these negative lobes we add'in some positive Gaussians of smaller 
proportions a little farther away, Now to compensate for these postive lobes, .... etc. This procedure 
cannot be followed if we have, say, a series of potentiometers controlling the brightness of a number 
of Gaussian spots. This is b ecauae the pots cannot be turned negative. There is no way to make negative 
light--much to the Frustration of many workers concerned with these kind of display problems. Thus the 
display of a reconstructed image is constrained to the positive cone xo>O, x~>O, x~>O .... ~.l>O. This 
puts on additional constraint on the sampling problem. A succinct statement of the problem is now: lO 
 Computer Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 Sampling problem (with positivity): with x restricted 
to the positive cone How do we approach this problem? Well, one popular method has been to ignore it 
completely: simply solve For the unconstrained optimum reconstruction and set any negative values to 
zero. This method may work in certain cases. For example, if the picture is sufficiently bright everywhere, 
the negative lobe may never dip below zero. Whenever we need to truncate negative values, however, possibly 
severe inaccuracies result. Characters, lines, and many other graphic objects are binary pictures with 
the lesser value being zero. Thus in graphics the need to truncate arises often. lhe typical case is 
illustrated by the previous example, viz. sampling an impulse. Simply truncating the negative lobes leaves 
a curious "ringing" pattern around the impulse (Figure 9). The ringing pattern in no way contributes 
to the minimization of the mean square metric, since their pr inÂ¢ipal Function was to compensate for 
the negative lobes. Setting the positive sidelobes to zero also happens to be very close to the minimum 
mean square error picture: a single Gaussian bump. Geometrically, the situation may be visualized as 
in Figure 10. We have suppressed all dimensions except two and drawn contour lines for error. The actual 
optimum can be seen to be at point A in which xcÂ£>O but x~<O. Setting x~_=O projects the point A onto 
B, a point which satisfies the constraints but which isn't very close to the true constrained minimum 
given by point C. How badly do we do by setting co-ordinates to zero? That depends on the eccentricity 
of the e11ipse and the angles that the major axis of the ellipse forms with the co-ordinate axes. With 
a nearly round ellipse, one whose major and minor axes are very nearly equal in length, one comes very 
close indeed to the to the optimum, when one sets the offending co-ordinates to zero (Figure 11). In 
the case of reconstructing say a I0X13 pixel character we are confronted with a 130 dimensional ellipsoid. 
The ellipsoid is formed from the level surfaces of the mean square error functional. To find its eccentricity 
we merely find the ratio of the largest to the smallest of the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the (quadratic) 
error functional, i.e. the matrix of second order partial derivatives This is none other than our old 
friend the Gram autocorrelation matrix. Thus we find that the set of eigenvalues, and hence the eccentricity 
of the ellipsoid, depends on the reconstruction kernel. Now, for an erthonormal reconstruction kernel, 
such as the Nyquist kernel, the Hessian is the identity matrix. Hence, the eigenvalues are all unity 
and the ellipsoid is perfectly round. Therefore, simply setting the offending co-ordinates to zero ~ives 
the constrained optim.um exact, l),. We do not have Nyquist kernels at our disposal, however, but rather 
Gaussians--which are decidedly not orthonormal. It turns out that finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of the Gram autocorrelation matrix is a well-known procedure called the Karhunen-Loeve transformation. 
Speaking very loosely, the eigenvalues correspond to the values of the Power spectral density, viz. the 
square of the Fourier transform magnitude of the autocorrelation Function. But the autocorrelation of 
a Gaussian distribution is again a Gaussian with double the standard deviation, and it's well known that 
the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian. Thus, there is a tremendous range in the magnitude 
of the eigenvalues encountered, the values being governed by an exponential of a term proportional to 
the square of the abcissa. In other words For a Gaussian distribution the ellipsoid is very eccentric. 
Furthermore, the angle of inclination of the ellipsoid with respect to the co-ordinate hyperplanes (xi=O) 
is given by direction cosines that correspond to the inner product of a Gaussian with the Karhunen-Loeve 
eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are very roughly sinusoids. These direction cosines, at least For the 
largest eigenvalues, are roughly equal, so the ellipsoid is pitched at an angle of about 45Â°--the worst 
case. To sum up the discussion so Far: While setting the negative coordinates to zero For orthonormal 
basis Functions is a very good procedure, For the Gaussian restoration kernels it is very bad. TIIE KUIIN-TUCKER 
CONDITIONS Since simply truncating the negative lobes of tile output signal will not provide an optimum 
solution subject to the positivity constraint, we must search for methods that will provide us with the 
optimum constrained solution to the antialiasing problem, Note that we now are talking about some non-linear 
filtering procedure that will provide us with the optimum sample values For some input image. Fortunately, 
the structure of the aliasing problem is such that certain key conditions are met. This simplifies the 
optimization problem immensely and gives us a relatively straightforward way to solve the problem. These 
conditions are the Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the method of solution is known as the method of feasable 
directions. To optimize a nonlinear functional subject to inequality constraints is, in general, a very 
difficult task. If the Functional and its constraints satisfy the following assumptions then we may apply 
the Kuhn-Tucker theorems for inequality constrained mathematical programming problems. The Kuhn-Tucker 
conditions are: (i) The functional is convex. That is if x~ and x~ (i=0,I .... ,n-l) are two points in 
the solution sp@ce, then In other words, the functional lles below a line joining any two of its values. 
See Figure 12. (ii) The feasible set, i.e. the set of points satisfying the constraints, is convex and 
has a nonempty interior. Fortunately, both these assumptions hold for the case at hand: reconstruction 
with Gaussian kernels and positive weights. Its evident that the square error metric is convex (for other 
visual metrics this condition may no longer hold). The second assumption is also satisfied. The positive 
cone is obviously convex and has a generous interior. ]] Computer Graphics We now state a Kuhn-Tucker 
theorem. Knhn-Tucker Theorem. Under the conditions mentioned above, the nonlinear programming problem 
(Equation 4.1) has a minimal sollltion x*>O iff there exists ~,*>0 such that the Lagrangian ~=0 has 
a saddle point at (x*,~,*). A useful interpretation of this theorem [Collatz and Wetterling 1975] is 
that at the optimum point x*, the gradient of the functional is perpendicular to the active constraining 
hyperplanes, viz. the coordinate hyperplanes in which x* has a zero component. If there is no constraining 
active hyperplane then the gradient must be zero. The Kuhn-Tncker theorem provides the basis for a number 
of different optimization algorithms. One of the simplest (and slowest) is the one we have chosen in 
this work: the method of feasible directions. In this iterative method, a point x ~ is updated by a vector 
proportional to the gradient of the functional projected upon a subspace which maintains the new iterate 
in the positive cone: Namely, % : -6~ where ~J is the gradient of the functional. P is the projection 
operator which limits ~J to a feasible subspace, and ~>0 is a sequence of numbers chosen to make the 
Jacobian decrease at each iteration (Steepest descent). There are several salient points about this 
method which should be mentioned. First, this method is nonlinear, e.g. In particular, if c is chosen 
to make the bulk of cf negative, then the output will be zero. Second, the method can in certain cases 
collapse to the unconstrained case. For an input image that lies deep in the feasible set, i.e. it is 
positive everywhere, then one can afford the luxury of negative lobes because the ultimate answer will 
still have only positive coefficients. For an input image on the boundary of the feasible set, i.e. one 
that has many pixels set to zero, the method will suppress negative lobes. The next section will demonstrate 
how these constraints control ringing. 5. RESULTS The above algorithm was programmed on a DECSYSTEM-20 
for both the one and two dimensional cases. For the input images we hand digitized characters on either 
a IxIDO or I00XI00 grid. The decimation ratio was set to 100:16 or 6.25. The coefficients were then reconstructed 
with artificial Gaussian distributions of known variances. Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 Results for 
the one dimensional case are as follows: An impulse response centered on a sample value gives the identical 
answer as the triangular kernel interpolant, a single Gaussian spot. Also shown is the unconstrained 
optimLJm for a box, which appears in Figure 13 as a ringing sinc-like function. Figure 14 shows the effect 
of constraints upon the negative lobes of a step response. Note that suppression occurs for not only 
the negative sidelobes but also for the residual positive sidelobes. We still have ringing on the positive 
portions of the step, however. These can be removed by a ran~)o constraint: if we know that the images 
have values between 0 and 1 (as do many graphic objects) then constraining the x~ to O<xL<1, gives the 
reconstruction shown in Figure ]5. Finally the response of the algorithm to a chirp signal is shown for 
comparison with the triangular case. For the two dimensional case, we reconstructed several characters 
with an artificial Gaussian spot. Rather than reconstruct with the natural electron beam spot on the 
CRT we chose to reconstruct with a much larger simulated spot. We did this for several reasons. First, 
the pictures were easier to analyze for artifacts. Second, at the time of writing we had as yet not measured 
the variance of the spot on the screen. Third, the image display available to us had only 4 bits per 
pixel both for the memory and the colormap. Additionally, the gamma of the display system was not adequately 
compensated for (this was a display intended for VLSI design aids). It is well known that for anti-aliasing 
experiments proper gamma correction is crucial [Crow 1975]. Rather than lose precious bits by trying 
to gamma correct in tile color map (remember we only have 16 levels in and out) we decided to reconstruct 
with large spots, gamma correct with high precision inside the computer and dither down. to four bits, 
trading spatial resolution for gray scale resolution. Figures 16-18 show the results of the algorithm 
compared with the original and the triangular filter reconstruction. 6. FUTURE WORK We see many ways 
to continue this work. We have not addressed at all the important problem of overlapping images. At 
present the expedient we use is to place each character In frambs that does not overlap. If we were to 
allow overlapping frames then we would be allowing more piÃeIs per character to yield a higher effective 
output resolution. There are dangers in allowing overlapping images, however. Because characters almost 
never occlude one another in the text case there is ustially no danger when one is performing linear 
processing: one simply adds the resulting images. In the case of our nonlinear processing the situation 
is more delicate. A careful analysis has yet to be done. 12 Computer Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August 
1981 The foremost task yet to be done is the inclusion of a better visual metric than the least squares 
metric. It will be clear from the following discussion that a minimum mean square reconstruction is quite 
far from optimum compared with a reconstruction which takes into account certain key features of the 
human visual system. TIIIT SINGLE CHANNEL MODEL The simplest model of the visual system is the so-called 
Lateral Inhibition model (also known as the single channel model). The model is given by the following 
equation Where f(~) is the input image, ~(~) is the reconstrncted~ image and h(~) is a PSF known as the 
lateral inhihition kernel (or RatliFf kernel). Thus, in this model, each of the individual images to 
be compared undergoes a logarithmic point transformation after which the difference is filtered and then 
summed in a mean square procedure. The frequency response corresponding to h(~) is shown in Figure Ig 
where the peak of the response curve is at about 3 cy/deg [Cornsweet 1971]. Let us analyze this image 
metric a bit. Recall that tile Parseval theorem relates mean square error in the spatial domain to that 
in the frequency domain [Rudin 1966]: ~0 o9 Applying this formula to the expression for the visual model 
response we obtain (via the convolution theorem) where H(~) is the Fourier transform of h(~), ~i (~) 
and ~2_ ((~) are the Fourier transforms of log fl and log f~-. Note that in this form the response is 
just a classical weighted least square error metric between the logs of the images. From the HTF of the 
visual system (Figure ]9) we see that this weighting favors the high frequencies much more than the low 
frequencies. There are two essential features that cause the optimum image reconstruction for ti~e ordinary 
least square metric and for the lateral inhibition model metric to differ significantly. The first concerns 
the relative importance given to errors at different luminance levels and the second concerns the relative 
importance given to errors at different spatial frequencies. The logarithmic point transformation, which 
forms tile nonlinearity in the initial stage of the model,, implements Weber's law:  E__AZ where AI 
is the just noticeable difference in luminance and I is the average luminance. This law holds over a 
range of intensities that easily encompasses the range encountered in graphics and text display. It has 
been found that k~.02. The precise form for the function implementing Weber's law is in dispute. However, 
all proposed functions are reasonably close to the logarithm for a range of intensities and share most 
of its important properties--such as concavity. In words, this law states that small luminance errors 
for the low luminance portions of an image are far more objectionable than those for the high luminance 
portions. An optimal approximator using this image metric wil] thus be more fastidious about the low 
luminance portions of an image, spending more of its error budget to fit the data there. Since the human 
visual system is more sensitive to errors in this portion (hence the logarithm in the model) images reconstructed 
in this manner should compare favorably to those of the ordinary least squares metric in which all the 
errors are treated as equals. A second difference is manifested by the frequency weighting which appears 
in Equation 6.1. Here the model correctly predicts that we are by far more sensitive to high spatial 
frequency errors. It is this increased sensitivity at high frequencies that makes the artifacts of fuzzy 
edges produced by the triangular kernel--and the persistent ringing produced by the unconstrained linear 
least squares approximant--so objectionable. Both artifacts are high frequency effects whose effect is 
enhanced by our visual system. Using the lateral inhibition metric will result in improved image sharpness 
and lower ringing at the expense or of higher errors at the low frequency portions of the image, which 
presumably we do not see. The methods For calcnlation of an optimal approximant for such an image metric 
have yet to be resolved. Introduction of the logarithmic nonlinearity (or any other nonlinearity popular 
in visual modelling) causes a loss of convexity for the functional. Thus, the Kuhn-Tucker theorems may 
not be applied directly. We are currently investigating implementations which will bypass this difficulty. 
HULTICHANNEL MODELS More realistic visual models can be considered for use in the optimal approximant 
scheme. Currently popular in the psychophysical literature are a class of models know as multichannel 
models [Graham and Nachmias 1971, Hostafavi and Sakrison 1976, Kajiya 1979]. In these models the image, 
after passing through a nonlinearity, is not filtered by a single frequency shaping network but rather 
by many bandpass channels of varying sensitivities. There is a certain amount of controversy over the 
characteristics of such channels and the mode of summation of the outputs of such channels, but it is 
a promising possibility that L metrics rather than L metrics may be closer to the truth. If this is the 
case then the door is open for nonlinear Chebyshev techniques to be applied to the antialiasing problem. 
CONCLUSIONS There is far more to the antialiasing problem than simple linear filtering. We have analyzed 
the performance of the linear Filtering approach to antialiasing, and introduced the use of more powerful 
techniques for certain critical applications such as the display of high quality text. Perhaps someday 
computational techniques will be discovered to perform these calculations for more general synthetic 
images. For now, though, the practical use of our technique is limited to images with relatively small 
pixel sizes--such as the display of text characters. 13 Computer Graphics Volume 15, Number 3 August
