Loop Network In the optimal loop network, both forward and backward links are active, and there exist 
several paths from a source to a destination. The network can tolerate several link and nodal interface 
failures before becoming partitioned. Intuitively, delay and reliability are improved since the skipping 
of several nodes creates "short cuts", and also provides more alternate paths. We will prove this more 
rigorously later in the paper. Figure 3. A 15-node Distributed Double Loop Computer Network The functional 
organization of a loop interface is shown in Figure 4. An interface receives messages from the host it 
is connected to. It also receives mes-sages relayed by the neighboring interfaces. Conflicts of the simultaneous 
arrivals of messages from the three streams are resolved in the same way as in DDLCN [WOLF 79b], i.e., 
by delaying incoming relayed mes-sages in variable-length shift registers located in the loop interface. 
To achieve better reliability, a loop interface is split into two identical modules which have separate 
control and separate line driver/receiver (D/R). Both modules share transmitter (T) and receiver (R) 
for communications with the host (H) connected to this in- terface. 4. BL Output/ \ BL Input I t I \

Otherwise, the message is forwarded one "short" step (on the forward loop)or, when appropriate, one "giant" 
step (on the backward loop). Messages cir- culate on the loops until they reach their intended desti- 
nations. An adaptive routing algorithm can be used to route messages when there are failures in the network.

Recall that both forward and backward loop are unidirectional, with the forward loop connecting adja- 
cent nodes and the backward loop connecting nodes at hop (i.e., skip) distance h > 1. The shortest route 
between a source and a destination may therefore in-volve a combination of forward and backward hops. 
For each node, there is some other node which is di- ametrically opposite, i.e., it is the farthest away 
in the hop distance sense. Indeed, in designing the backward loop topology, the skip distance h will 
be selected such that the diameter d, i.e., the maximum over all node pair distances i.s minimized. Clearly, 
the hop distance from a node to all other nodes will vary from 1 to d. In the following we derive expressions 
for maximum and average number of hops and find their optimum values. Let N be the number of nodes in 
the network; h be the skip distance in the backward loop; and d be the diameter. We want to choose h 
so as to minimize, d = diameter = max d,~ over all i,j. where d, is the shortest hop distance from node 
i to node j. The nodes in the network are numbered from 0 to N-1. To get the shortest path between i 
and j we use backward hops as long as it is advantageous. For two diametrically opposite nodes, backward 
hops are advan-tageous as long as d is greater than (N-bh), where b is the number of backward hops used. 
In addition to the backward hops, h-1 forward hops will be required to reach the farthest node. The relationship 
between max-imum number of hops d and skip distance h is, d= N-(d-/1 + 1)h + (h- 1) d= N-dh + I12- 1 
d= ~ +(/1-1) lNl The average number of hops is defined as, 1 J 1 "N ,=0 (N- 1~-do where d,, = O. As the

tances to all other nodes in the network. Note that we always consider the shortest distance between 
any node pair. Recall that the maximum number of backward hops used in any route is, Using this result 
we have, S= [1 +2 +3 +....+ (N- bh-1)1 + [1 +2 +....+ /11 + [2 + 3 +....+ (/1 + 1)] .... + [b + (b + 
1) +....+ (b + b - 1)] Each term in the sum corresponds to a route with 0, 1, 2 ..... b number of backward 
"giant" hops (i.e., steps on a backward loop) respectively. Manipulating the previous expression, we 
obtain: s = [1 +2 +3 +....+ (N- bh-1)1 + h(l + 2 +....+ b) + b(1 + 2 +....+ /7-1) which simplifies to, 
s= (N-bh)(N-bit-1) + bh 2 T (b +/1) The average number of hops is given by S/(N-1), i.e., [ ' I(N -bb)(N

 For the sake of comparison, we report DDLCN and daisy-chain results. These are: For DDLCN, AVG (N -1)

in a way similar to Wolf's [WOLF 79b] relating each link utilization to the total message arrival rate

the total message traffic that the network can handle before saturation occurs. When link utilization 
reaches unity, the network is saturated. The total message arrival rate at which this occurs is the maximum 
traffic the network can handle, and is defined to be the throughput. For the analysis we make the fol- 
lowing assumptions [KLEI 76]: 1) Poisson message generation with total aggre- gate rate -y, (m~/sec) 
2) Uniform tramc pattern, and 3) Saturated throughput conditions, i.e., message traffic on each link 
equals link capacity. We assume that shortest routes only are used for message transmissions. If there 
is more than one shor-test route, traffic will be equally divided among the al- ternate routes. The total 
traffic on a forward link may be different from the total traffic on a backward link. As the average 
number of hops AVG is computed by considering the shortest routes from a node to all other nodes, the 
total network traffic caused by distributing ~,/N units of traffic from one source to all other destina- 
tions is: T! + T b = AVG*y/N where T~ is the contribution to total traffic on a forward link and Tb is 
the contribution to total traffic on a back- ward link. By using suitable policies for routing traffic 
when there is more than one shortest route between a node pair, it is possible to balance the flow on 
forward and backward links. That is, T I = Tb = +AVG*y/N When all sources are active, saturation is reached 
if: (7"1. + Tb)N = 2Ntz where u is the link capacity (msg/sec) Substituting for r I and T0 we obtain: 
YSAT * AVG = 2#N or: 2/xN YSAT = A VG Finally, substituting for AVG we obtain: 2(N)(N -1) /z "YSAT = 
 +INI" (INI+") ~'sAr is maximum if average number of hops is minimum. Therefore, ysAr is also maximized 
when We may compare 'ds result with DDLCN and daisy-chain results. 2(N)(N -l) For DDLC~, tsar = For 
daisy-chain, "YSAT 4(N)(N -1) /z Since ~'SAT is proportional to the inverse of AVG, and AVG is minimized 
by our topology, the throughput is also optimal for our topology. As a special case, when N is the square 
of an in-teger, we get the following closed form expressions for maximum number of hops, average number 
of hops, total flow, and throughput. Diameter d = 2(~ -1) N Avg. no. of hops- (./~ +1) 2(N - 1) z, sAr=

there is a link failure, the maximum and average number of hops will increase. However, the performance 
of the optimal loop can be shown to be still superior to that of DDLCN or daisy-chain loop in simi- lar 
failure conditions. 5. FAULT TOLERANCE The optimal double loop architecture provides good protection 
against node and link failures. As many alternate routes exist between any node pair, paths can be selected 
adaptively in case of failures. The effect of a node failure is to increase the maximum number of hops 
for some nodes and increase the average number of hops slightly. Figure 6 shows the effect of node #0 
failure on optimal loop and daisy-chain loop, and Figure 7 shows the effect of link 0--1 failure on optimal 
loop and daisy-chain loop. a / Max. hops ..... Daisy chain Optimal J I I I I I I I I I I I, J 0 1 2 3

of fault-tolerance is to compute the terminal pair reliabilities. We consider two farthest nodes for 
terminal reliability analysis. In the optimal double loop network there exist many alternate routes between 
any pair of nodes, and therefore we expect high terminal pair reliability. For the two farthest nodes, 
one can intuitively see that the following proper- ties hold: Terminal reliability ~ No. of alternate 
routes; and Terminal reliability ~ 1 diameter We have already shown that the diameter is minimized when 
h = [#-ill" Also, for this value of h, the number of alternate routes between the two farthest nodes 
will be higher in the optimal loop than in the daisy-chain loop, as shown in the following derivation. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the optimal loop network gives higher terminal pair reliability than 
the daisy-chain loop. Now we compute the number of alternate routes between any two farthest nodes in 
the network. There is one path using only forward links, which may not be a shortest path. There are 
several additional paths which use backward links and forward links. All these routes are shortest routes 
between that node pair. Each of these routes consists of b = I---~--N [ backward ho,,s and . . J h+l 
] r, (h-l) forward hops. We get d)ffere,nt routes depending on me relative positions ol giant steps and 
forward hops along the route. Therefore, the number of alter- nate routes between the two farthest nodes 
is the number of combinations of b out of (b-t-h-l) objects, that is: b = h-I The expression for the 
number of distinct routes is ACKNOWLEDGMENTS given by, The authors wish to thank Prof. Avizienis for

CONCLUSIONS We have presented an optimal double loop topol- ogy for locally distributed networks. This 
network is shown to provide the optimum performance with respect to maximum number of hops, average number 
of hops, throughput rate and terminal reliability. In par- ticular, better performance is achieved with 
respect to previously proposed topologies such as DDLCN and daisy-chain loop. The cost of this topology 
in length of /I loop cable is N([x/-N] + 1), as compared with 2N for DDLCN and 3N for daisy-chain. Nodal 
interface costs are the same for all these architectures. One should realize that in a local network 
cable cost represents only a small fraction of total system cost. Therefore it ap- pears that the additional 
cable cost is well compensated for by the performance benefits of the optimal loop to- pology. This type 
of interconnection scheme among host processors may find applications in tightly coupled mul- tiprocessor 
system. A separate host processor can per-form the reconfiguration in case of failures. The reconfiguration 
of interconnections under failures, and addition of new nodes can be done easily if the inter-faces are 
brought to one place. Interestingly, if all the links are bidirectional, the optimal double loop intercon- 
nection is precisely the same as the Illiac IV structure. [BARN 68] [FARM 69] [GRNA 79] [GRNA 80] [KLEI
