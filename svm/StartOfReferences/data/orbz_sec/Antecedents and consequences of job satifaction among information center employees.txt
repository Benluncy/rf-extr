Cookeville, TN 38505, (615) 372-3385 ABSTRACT Despite the great need to understand the determinants and 
consequences of lob satisfaction for Information Center (IC) personnel; very little has been published 
in this area. This study explores the antecedents and consequences of job satisfaction for IC employees. 
Five components of job satisfaction: work, supervision, co-workers, pay, and promotion, were examined 
besides overall job satisfaction. Two stress variables: role ambiguity and role conflict, were considered 
as antecedents to satisfaction. Organizational commitment and intentions to leave the organization were 
considered as outcomes from job satisfaction. The study also assessed the importance of personal characteristics 
as moderating variables to the relationship between the two role stress variables and job satisfaction. 
Results show that role ambiguity was the most dysfunctional variable for IC employees in relation to 
job satisfaction, Organizational tenure was found to moderate the relationships between role stress variables 
and overall job satisfaction, and some of its components. In addition, the relationship between role 
ambiguity and some components of job satisfaction were found to be education and age dependent, Results 
also confirmed the importance of job satisfaction in predicting organizational commitment and intentions 
to leave. Implications for IC management and future research are discussed. Permission to copy without

computing (EUC) represents a significant development in the Information Systems (IS) field in the 1980 
s (Benson, 1983; Guimaraes and Ramanujan, 1986). This phenomenum is driven by many forces: sharp decreases 
in the price of computing equipment (particularly that of microcomputers), an increase in the power and 
simplicity of the new software, the IS department s traditional systems development backlog, improvements 
in the availability and capability of communication networks. The result has been an enormous proliferation 
of microcomputers among users who are not IS professionals and the growth of mainframe based user computing 
[Car~ 1987; Cheney, Mann and Amoroso, 1986; Igbaria, Pavri and Huff, 1989]. in 1974, lBM-Canada addressed 
the need for providing end-users with direct, ready access to information processing resources through 
a central facility (Davis and Olson, 1985). Information centers (IC) were created to provide the necessary 
support, such as training, consulting, hardware and software support. The idea is to assist end-users 
to develop their own applications accessing data on their own terms to solve their business problems 
(Carr, 1988). The importance of IC for meeting user needs is made clear by the phenomenal growth in the 
number of organizations which have established information centers, It has been found that by 1986 at 
least half of the large companies already had information centers [American Management Association, 1986], 
The importance of better understanding the factors related to the recruitment, development, and retention 
of IC professionals is underscored by the high demand and the extremely short supply of IC personnel 
[Carr, 1987; 1988; Connally, 1988; Rainer, Cart Snyder and Frolick, 1989; Saks, 1989]. Further aggravating 
the problem are the rising personnel costs relative to equipment costs [Ahituv and Neumann, 1990], and 
high rates of turnover among the IS employees in general and IC staff in particular [Bartol and Martin, 
1982; Lucas, 1989; Rifkin, 1985]. In a recent study, the importance of appropriate staffing to IC performance 
was emphasized. A competent staff, good communications with end足users, and top-management support were 
judged to be the most important critical success factors for IC managers [Magal, Carr and Watson, 1989]. 
The job satisfaction of IS personnel has been addressed by several studies [i.e. Baroudi, 1985; Goldstein, 
1989; Igbaria, 1991]. One would hope that much of the findings will be applicable to IC personnel. However, 
there is considerable evidence that IC personnel differ from IS employees on a number of demographic, 
personality and motivational factors. It has been noted that IC personnel have great need for interpersonal 
skills, that their business skills normally rank ahead of their technical skills, that they tend to be 
more creative and persistent, have greater need for social interaction, and are more end足user oriented 
[Carr, 1987; Gunton, 1988; Lucas, 1989; Perry, 1987; Rainer, et.al., 1989]. In addition, it has been 
reported that a larger percentage of (over half) of IC staff members are women, that a larger percentage 
(nearly half) are 30 years of age or younger, and that they tend to be better educated than their IS 
counterparts [Carr, 1988; Rainer, et.al., 1989]. There is also evidence that IC personnel face limited 
advancement, specially into senior IC positions within their organizations, That, coupled with negative 
salary differentials, are thought to be responsible for some IC personnel dissatisfaction with their 
jobs [Carr, 1988; Rainer, et.al, 1989]. These findings have major implications for the management of 
IC and further highlight the need to examine the antecedents and outcomes of job satisfaction for IC 
personnel. However, despite the great importance of the topic, the research on IC has mainly been concentrated 
on describing the general concept of IC, searching for the ideal model in the field, or exploring the 
critical success factors for IC managers [Car~ 1987; Guimaraes, 1984; Hammond, 1982; Magal, Carr and 
Watson, 1989; White and Christy, 19871. Some researchers may have investigated some IC personnel issues 
fi.e. Guimaraes, 1986], but none has focused attention on the antecedents and consequences of job satisfaction 
among IC personnel, This study has two major objectives. The first is to invest igate the antecedents 
as well as the consequences of job satisfaction among IC staff, Specifically, the study sought to examine 
whether the kinds of antecedents and outcomes of job satisfaction for IS personnel reported by Baroudi 
[19{35] are also true for individuals in the IC area. The second major objective is to examine IC job 
satisfaction as a whole and in terms of its five dimensions: the work itself, supervision, coworkers, 
pay, and promotion, as prescribed kty the job descriptive index (JDI) [Smith, Kendall, Hulin, 1969]. 
The JDI was selected because it is viewed by many investigators as one of the most thoroughly researched 
and developed measures of its kind ~room, 1964], and because, in terms of both predictive power and construct 
validity, the five components of job satisfaction have shown strong relationships with other important 
variables such as organizational commitment and the employee s intentions to leave, The model used in 
this study, its component variables, and the proposed relationships among these variables are discussed 
in the following section, A MODEL OF JOB SATISFAC1-ION The job satisfaction of IS personnel has been 
studied widely [Couger, 1988; Couger and Zawacki, 1980; Baroudi, 1985; Compton, 1987; Goldstein, 1989; 
Goldstein and Rockart, 1984; Igbaria, 1991]. The well established relationship of overall job satisfaction 
with role stress, as represented by role ambiguity and role conflict [Baroudi, 1985; Goldstein, 1989; 
Goldstein and Rockart, 1984; Igbaria, 1991] clearly show the need to understand the antecedents of overall 
job satisfaction and its major components. However, the multivariate linkages among these variables, 
in particular the moderating effect of personal variables such as age, gende~ organizational tenure, 
and education have not received any attenticm in the IS literature, The model proposed and tested by 
Baroudi [1985] to study the turnover intentions of IS professionals was modified slightly for this study 
to distinguish the five components of job satisfaction, The present study sought to extend the previous 
findings by undertaking a more fine-grained analysis of the relationships between role stress, job satisfaction, 
 organizational commitment, and turnover intentions among IC personnel. Additionally, the study sought 
to assess the role of personnel differences as moderating variables to the relationships between role 
stress and job satisfaction. Figure 1 presents the model of job satisfaction examined in this study. 
The model is comprised of four 353 a) .足 1 >m30 .EgEE8 sets of variables: (a) two role stress variables: 
role ambiguity and role conflict; (b) personal characteristics; (c) job satisfaction; and (d) career 
outcomes: organizational commitment and behavior intentions to leave, Role ambiguity has been defined 
as the degree to which clear information is lacking regarding (a) the expectations associated with a 
role, (b) the methods of fulfilling known role expectations, and/or (c) the consequences of role performance 
[Graen, 1976; Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, and Rosenthal, 1964]. Job satisfaction refers to the primary 
affective reactions of individuals to various facets of the job and to job experiences [Locke, 1976], 
Organizational commitment reflects one s evaluation of the organization as a whole, and encompasses three 
dimensions: a strong belief in and acceptance of the organization s goals and values, willingness to 
exert considerable effort on behalf of the organization, and a strong desire to maintain membership 
in the organization [Porter, Crampon and Smith, 1976], Intention to leave refers to the individual s 
perceived likelihood that s(he) will be staying or leaving the employer organization. The model in Figure 
1 posits (1) that role stress variables will be directly related to job satisfaction; (2) that the relationship 
of job satisfaction to role stress variables will be moderated by personal characteristics of IC employees; 
(3) that job satisfaction will affect organizational commitment; and (4) that job satisfaction will have 
direct and indirect effects on behavioral intentions to leave the organization. The two role-based stressors 
were reported to be negatively associated with job satisfaction among IS employees and others [Baroudi, 
1985; Bedeian and Armenakis, 1981; Brooke, Russell and Price, 1988; Goldstein and Rockart, 1984; House 
and Rizzo, 1972; Igbaria, 1991; Miles and Perrault, 1976; Van Sell, Brief and Schuler, 1981]. Keller 
[1975] found that role conflict is inversely related to satisfaction regarding pay, supervision, and 
promotion but that it is unrelated to satisfaction with work and/or coworkers. Keller [1975] also found 
that role ambiguity is inversely related to satisfaction with work, but is unrelated to satisfaction 
with pay, coworkers, supervision, and promotion. Goldstein and Rockart [1984] found, among a sample of 
programmers/analysts, inverse correlations between role conflict and general job satisfaction, satisfaction 
with coworkers and with supervision. Baroudi [1985] and Igbaria (1991 )Iooked at the overall job satisfaction 
of IS professionals and reported that role ambiguity and role conflict are inversely related to job satisfaction. 
These findings and others suggest (1) that a general measure of job satisfaction might not sufficiently 
discriminate the potential outcomes of role stress and (2) that role stress might have direct effects 
on each of the five components of job satisfaction as well as on job satisfaction as a whole, Stress 
researchers have proposed a number of personal variables as moderators of people s responses to role 
stressors. Four personal variables were selected for this study because their effect in moderating job 
satisfaction has been previously demonstrated [Beehr and Newman, 1978; Parasuraman and Cleek, 1984; Schuier, 
1980; Van Sell, et,al., 1981]. Schuler [1977 J reported that employee s ability (operationalized as 
education and/or length of service in the organization) is a significant moderator for the relationship 
between role stress and job satisfaction, Based on this evidence, we propose that education and organizational 
tenure will moderate relationships of the two role stress variables with job satisfaction. Gender is 
the third personal variable used as moderator in this case, Empirical research to date reveals inconclusive 
results concerning the relationship of employee gender to role stress and job satisfaction. Tung [1980]1 
reported that women experienced lower levels of job-related !stress than men. However, others have found 
higher prevalence of role ambiguity among women than men [Paul, 1974; Zaleznik, Kets de Vries and Howard, 
19771. A third set of studies found no differences between males and females in experiencing role conflict 
and job-related strain [Herman and Gyllstrom, 1977; Parasuraman and Cleek, 1984; Paul, 19741], Some of 
the inconsistent findings may be partly due to the fact that male and female subjects were not matched 
by job level. The high percentage of women among IC employees [Carr, 1988] and the finding that women 
working in [C s felt significantly better about their career prospects than their male colleagues [Rainer, 
et al., 1989] suggests that gender should be examined, Therefore, we propose employee gender as the third 
moderating variable, Finally, we propose employee age as the fourth moderating variable for the relationship 
between role stress and job satisfaction [Van Sell, et.al., 1981]. Several studies have focused on the 
relationships between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Moderate zero-order correlations 
in the ranges of ,30 to .62 between job satisfaction (particularly overall job satisfaction or satisfaction 
with the work itself) and organizational commitment have 355 been observed repeatedly in the IS field 
as well as in other fields [Baroudi, 1985; Bartol, 1983; Brooke, et al., 1988; Cheloha and Farr, 1980; 
Parasuraman, 1989]. Furthermore, Brief and Aldag [1980] have proposed the five facets of job satisfaction 
as antecedents of organizational commitment. Therefore, we expect that job satisfaction will have a direct 
relationship to employee commitment to the IC organization. The importance of job satisfaction as a key 
attitudinal variable leading to intention to leave is also well documented in the literature [Abelson, 
1987; Arnold and Feldman, 1982; Baroudi, 1985; Bluedorn, 1982; Dougherty, Bluedorn, and Keen, 1985; Michaels 
and Spector, 1982; Price, 1977 J. In a similar fashion, a number of empirical studies also confirm the 
important role of organizational commitment as a determinant of intention to leave [Baroudi, 1985; Bluedorn, 
1982; Horn, Katerberg, and Hulin, 1979; Parasuraman, 1989; Porter, et al., 1976], Moreover, the intuitive 
notion that job satisfaction affects intention to leave primarily through its effect on organizational 
commitment is contradicted by findings that both job satisfaction and organizational commitment directly 
contribute to turnover intentions [Dougherty, et al. [1985], and Michaels and Spector [1982]. Therefore, 
we predict that job satisfaction will have direct and indirect effects on IC personnel s intention to 
leave. METHOD Sample and Procedure Thirty-eight companies with operations in the state of Ohio and known 
to have significant IC activities were asked to participate in this study. Twenty-eight companies agreed 
to participate in this study. Among them 14 companies were in manufacturing, 6 in multi足industry, 2 in 
insurance, and the remaining included utilities such as banks, and others. All the companies had a minimum 
of five years of end-user computing experience. The IS directors of these companies were the entry point 
and introduced the researchers to IC personnel participating in the study, Ninety-two IC employees from 
the twenty-eight companies were asked to participate in the study and received the survey questionnaire 
directly from the researchers. Participation was voluntary, and participants were assured that their 
individual responses would be treated as confidential. Seventy-six IC professionals completed the questionnaire 
(82.6 percent response rate). Sixty足nine of them completed the survey on site and 7 returned it through 
the mail. Of the 76 respondents, 36 (47.4 percent) were men and 40 (52.6 percent) were women. The age 
of the participants ranged from 21 to 46, with an average of 32.16 years, Their average length of service 
or organizational tenure was 5.18 years. The educational level of the IC professional included completed 
high school (21.1 percent), college degree (69.7 percent), and master degree (9.2 percent). Table 1 presents 
descriptive information on the participants. Table 1: Profile of Respondents (N=76) Age Mean 32.16 Median

S,D, 4.10 Measures Personal/Demographic variables. Four demographic variables were also included in the 
analysis, They are gender, age, organizational tenure, and education. Gender was assessed with a fixed-response 
item (1=female; 2=male). Age was measured in years. Education consisted of four levels from (1) high 
school to (4) Ph.D. degree. For organizational tenure, participants were asked how long they worked for 
an organization. In addition to personal variables, several multiple-item measures were used to operationalize 
job satisfaction, and its antecedent and outcome variables. Role stress variables. Role ambiguity and 
role conflict were operationalized by the scales developed by Rizzo, House and Lirtzman [1970]. Each 
scale was scored using a 7-point response mode ranging from (1) very false to (7) very true , and by 
averaging across the relevant items. Both role conflict and role ambiguity were scored so that the greater 
the score, the greater the perceived stress. The Cronbach s alpha (a) internal consistency reliability 
coefficient for the measures of role ambiguity and role conflict were .81 and .71, respectively, Job 
satisfaction. Satisfaction was assessed through the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) developed by Smith, et 
al, [1969], The JDI was chosen because of its obvious benefits: It provides reliable and valid assessments 
with general applicability, thus affording comparable results across studies. As mentioned earlier, the 
JDI measures satisfaction with five facets of the job: the work itself, supervision, coworkers, pay, 
and promotion. The 3-point JDI responses were defined so that a negative response ( yes to a negative 
item or no to a positive item) was scored 1. A positive response was scored 3, and 1don t know responses 
( ? ) were scored 2. The coefficients of reliability (Cronbach s Alpha) for each of the five subscales 
are: work (a=.64), supervision (a=.66), coworkers (a=.61 ), pay (a=,76), and promotion (a=.90). The items 
within each of these five components were then summed and averaged to form submeasures of job satisfaction, 
Since most of the IS research focused on overall job satisfaction, a second order factor analysis [Nunnally, 
1978] was conducted to test for underlying homogeneity in the five subscales of job satisfaction, The 
results showed a single factor solution (eigenvalue of 2.92), which explained 58,4 percent of the explained 
variance. Therefore, the five subscales were aggregated and averaged to create a composite measure of 
overall job satisfaction, The items were recorded such that high scores reflected high level of job satisfaction. 
The alpha reliability coefficient for the overall job satisfaction scale was .95. Organizational commitment. 
Commitment to the organization was operationalized using the 15-item scale of Porter et. al. [1976] to 
measure the extent to which the individual identifies with organizational goals, is willing to exert 
effort on behalf of the organization, and intends to remain a member of the organization [Mowday, Porter 
and Steers, 1982], The reliability and validity of the 15-item scale have been previously demonstrated 
[Mowday, Steers and Porter, 1979]. Using a 7-point Likert-type format, the response categories for each 
item ranged from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree . The responses for each item were then 
summed and averaged to yield a measure of organizational commitment (a= .92). Intention to leave. The 
employee s intention to leave the organization was measured via three items developed by Mobley, Homer 
and Hollingsworth [1978] Responses to each item were recorlded on a 5足point Likert-type scale ranging 
from (1) very unlikely to (5) very likely , The three items were summed and averaged to form the intention 
to leave index (a = .91). Data Analysis Multiple regression analysis using Ihierarchical technique [Cohen 
and Cohen, 1983] was performed to assess the incremental contribution of each of the role stress variables 
to the predicticm of job satisfaction, The same was used to assess the contribution of job satisfaction 
to the prediction of organizational commitment and intention to leave, The relative influence of the 
antecedent variables on the criterion measures was determined by applying the usefulness criterion [Cohen 
and Cohen, 1983; Darlinton, 1968] rather than the magnitude of the coefficients. The usefulness of a 
predictor variable in explaining variance in the dependent variable is determined by the increment in 
the squared multiple correlation coefficient (R2) that occurs when a given variable is added to the regression 
equation. The direct effect of role stress on job satisfaction was assessed through the increment in 
R2 as role conflict and role ambiguity were added to the regression equation. Moderated multiple regression 
analysis [Zedeck, 1971] using the hierarchical approach was performed to assess the moderating effect 
of personal characteristics on individuals affective reactions to each of the five facets of job satisfaction 
and overall job satisfaction, This technique has been recommended as preferable to subgroup analysis 
for testing moderator effects because it mi~kes more complete use of the data and permits the determination 
of both, the independent effects of the hypothesized moderating variable, and its interaction effect 
with the predictor variable on the dependent variable [Peters and Champoux, 19791; Zedeck, 1971 ], First, 
each of the job satisfaction components and the overall job satisfaction were regressed on each of the 
two role stress variables. Each of the four personal variables were added to the regression equation 
separately in the second step of the hierarchical analysis, The final step included the interaction terms 
for each of the two stress role variables with the four personal variables. The incremental contributions 
(AR2) of role stress on job satisfaction were examined for statistical significance. To avoid the problems 
associated with subgroup correlational analysis [Arnc)ld, 1982; Peters and Champoux, 1979], slope coefficients 
were used to examine the nature of the significant interactions. 357 Finalty, hierarchical multiple regression 
analyses were performed to assess the incremental contribution of job satisfaction on organizational 
commitment and intentions to leave. Organizational commitment was initially regressed on personal variables 
as control variables (step 1), the role stress variables were added in step 2, and overall job satisfaction 
added in step 3, In a similar manner, organizational commitment was regressed on the personal variables 
(step 1), with role stress added (step 2), and with the five facets of job satisfaction added (step 3), 
Finally, intention to leave was regressed on the personal variables (step 1), then we added the regression 
equation role stress (step 2), overall job satisfaction and each of the five facets of job satisfaction 
(step 3), and organizational commitment (step 4). RESULTS The means, standard deviations, and the matrix 
of intercorrelations among the study variables are presented in Table 2. The results of the regression 
analyses shown in Table 3 indicate that the two role stress variables collectively explained a substantial 
amount of the variance in the different components of job satisfaction: work (3070), Supervision (35~o), 
workers (20%), pay (15Yo) and promotion (26%). Further, the stress variables account for 51% of the variance 
in overall job satisfaction. In ail cases the significance level is .01 or better. Role conflict is found 
to be inversely related to four of the job satisfaction components (p = .05 or better). As expected, 
role ambiguity (AR2= ,17, ,19, .8, ,15, ,13, and .33) and role conflict (AR2= .13, .16, .12, .00, .13, 
,18), separately and respectively, were generally associated with decreases in satisfaction with work, 
supervision, coworkers, pay, promotion, and overall satisfaction. All the associations were significant 
at ,01 level, except the association between role conflict and satisfaction with pay which is shown to 
be zero. The moderated regression results for personal variables are presented in Table 4. The data show 
that age has a mild influence on the relationship between role ambiguity and satisfaction with pay (AR2 
= .05, p s .05). Significant interaction effects on satisfaction with work were obtained for organizational 
tenure with role ambiguity (AR2 = ,09, p s .01) and for educalion with role ambiguity (AR2 = .04, p s 
.05). In addition, a significant moderator effect was found for organizational tenure with role ambiguity 
on satisfaction with supervision (AR2 = ,07, p s ,05), with coworkers (AR2 = .05, p s ,05), and with 
overall satisfaction (AR2 = .07, p s .01). Table 4 also shows that organization tenure moderates the 
relationships between role conflict and satisfaction with supervision (AR2 = .06 p s ,05), with coworkers 
(AR2 = .07, p s .05), with overall job satisfaction (Al# = .03, p s .05). Education was found to moderate 
the relationship between role ambiguity and satisfaction with supervision (AR2 = .09, ps .01), and satisfaction 
with promotion (AR2 = .20, p s .001). Contrary to expectations, gender did not moderate any of the relationships 
of role stress with job satisfaction. Also, age and education did not moderate any of the relationships 
of role conflict with the components of job satisfaction. Age showed significant main effects on the 
relationship between role ambiguity and satisfaction with coworkers. It also has an impact on the relationship 
between role conflict and the employee s satisfaction with work, supervision, coworkers, and overall 
satisfaction with the job. Organizational tenure affects the relationships between satisfaction with 
pay and role ambiguity and role conflict. In contrast, gender shows no effect on job satisfaction with 
role stress either independently or interactively. Education has no main effect on job satisfaction. 
 As noted by several researchers [Hunt, Osborn, and Larson, 1975; Peters and Champoux, 1979], an infinite 
number of slope coefficients can be computed within a moderated multiple regression model. Peters and 
Champoux [1979] recommended that the slope coefficients be used for analysis because they suggest the 
differential impacts which are likely to occur from interventions targeted at alternative groups and 
alternative variables (p. 91). Following the procedure used by Hunt et al, [1975], values for each of 
the moderator variables (age, organizational tenure, or education) falling within + 1 SD from the mean 
value were used to obtain two equations. The equations, one for the high (+ 1 SD) values and the other 
for the low (-1 SD) values of each independent variable (role ambiguity or role conflict), were used 
as a predictor for each of the dependent variables (overall satisfaction and satisfaction with each of 
its five components), Table 5 presents the results from the moderated multiple regression analyses, It 
shows that, for older IC employees, satisfaction with pay is lower for IC employees experiencing higher 
role ambiguity (13= -.14 vs -.1O). The results also indicate tha,t at higher levels of organizational 
tenure, satisfaction with work and supervision are significantly lower for IC employees experiencing 
higher role ambiguity (13 = -,13, -.08 vs -.08, -.07, for satisfaction with work and II N u足 11 Y . c0.=

HoweveC the overall satisfaction level declines sharply for higher levels of role ambiguity (13=-.O9 
vs -.08). Apparently, job satisfaction for new IC employees are strongly influenced by their ability 
to understand what is expected of them on the job. Thus, IC managers should ensure that task assignments 
and expectation are made specially clear for new IC staff. The satisfaction levels with supervision and 
the overall job satisfaction are strongly dependent on the level of role conflict experienced by the 
employee, For lower levels of role conflict, IC employees who have extensive organizational tenure report 
higher satisfaction with coworkers (13-.l8 vs -.07), However, when role conflict is high, IC people with 
less organizational tenure report higher satisfaction with coworkers than IC old timers. A possible explanation 
is that new IC employees are less willing to blame their coworkers for the difficulties created by role 
conflict than their more senior counterparts. The interactive relationships of education on satisfaction 
with work, supervision and promotion, and the relationships with role ambiguity are also presented in 
Table 5, The results show that, for lower levels of role ambiguity, less educated IC employees report 
higher satisfaction with work @=-. 10 vs -.07) and supervision (13=-.16 vs -.08) but lower satisfaction 
with promotion (13=-.O8vs -.19) than employees with more education, However, when role ambiguity is high, 
the more educated employees report greater satisfaction with their work and supervision, but lower satisfaction 
with promotion. Apparently, more education enables employees to better handle role ambiguity but also 
increase their expectations for promotion, The results of the hierarchical regression analysis with organizational 
commitment and intention to leave as the dependent variables, are presented in Table 6. The figures show 
the change in R2(AR2) representing the increment in unique variance explained by a given independent 
variable, or its usefulness and importance as a predictor. The variables in the regression equations 
(e.g., personal variables, role stress, and either overall job satisfaction or satisfaction with the 
five facets of the job) cumulatively explain 31% and 33% of the variance in organizational commitment, 
when overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with its five components were added to the equation, respectively, 
Similarly, the above variables explained 38% and 41 %0 of the variance in intention to leave, when overall 
job satisfaction and satisfaction with its five components were added to the equation, respectively. 
Analysis of the relative contribution of the three sets of predictors for organizational commitment shows 
that personal variables account for zero portion of its variance. The incremental contribution of the 
role stress variables combined is R2 = .12(NS). Most of this influence is accounted for by role ambiguity 
(AR* = .09, ps .05), Overall job satisfaction accounts for a substantial proportion of the variance in 
organizational commitment (AR* = .19, ps .001). When satisfaction with the five facets of the job were 
added, their incremental contribution as a set were .21 (p s .001). Satisfaction with supervision and 
satisfaction with promotion (AR* = .08, ps ,05, each) made the largest contribution to explaining the 
variance in organizational commitment. The bivariate results (Table 2) show four of the five facet satisfaction 
measures to be directly related to organizational commitment, whereas the multiple regression results 
indicate that only two of the satisfaction subscales have meaningful effects on organizational commitment. 
The pattern of results obtained for intention to leave the job is similar to those observed for organizational 
commitment. Table 6 shows that personal variables account for a negligible proportion of the variance 
in intentions to leave (AR* = .03, NS), and that 12 percent of the variance is explained by role stress, 
mainly by role ambiguity (AR* = .08, p s .05), Overall job satisfaction (AR2 = .10, p s .01) is a major 
determinant of turnover intent. Regarding the influence of the five components of satisfaction on turnover 
intentions, most of the variance is equally accounted for by employee satisfaction with supervision and 
promotion (AR* = ,06, p s .05, each), Organizational commitment becomes the key predictor of intentions 
to leave when overall job satisfaction (AR* = .13) or its five component variables (AR* = .12) are added 
to the regression equation. In all cases, ps ,001, DISCUSSION The results from this study indicate that 
job satisfaction among IC employees is the product of complex linkages among personal/demographic characteristics 
and role stress variables (e.g., role ambiguity and role conflict). The latter are considered to be the 
antecedent variables for predicting job satisfaction and, in turn, organizational commitment and intentions 
to leave (the outcome variables), The results confirm previous findings concerning the efficacy of role 
ambiguity and role conflict in predicting job satisfaction. They also confirm the direct relationship 
of job satisfaction to organizational commitment, and its inverse relationship with intention to leave 
the organization [Baroudi, 1985]. As expected, role ambiguity was found to be inversely related to overall 
job satisfaction and to all five of its component measures. Further, the inverse relationship of role 
conflict with overall job satisfaction and four of its five measures also met expectations. The hypothesis 
that the different personal variables would moderate the relationship between role stress variables and 
job satisfaction was only partially confirmed, Of the 48 interaction effects tested only 11 were significant. 
The main finding in this area was that organizational tenure does have an impact on the relationships 
between role ambiguity and overall job satisfaction, and satisfaction with supervision and with coworkers. 
Similarly, as a moderator variable, organization tenure does influence the relationship between role 
conflict and overall job satisfaction, and each of its five component variables. Organization tenure 
also is shown to have a direct relationship with satisfaction with promotion. This indicates that, in 
general, lower experience in the IC organization tend to make employees more susceptible to job dissatisfaction, 
and it also intensifies employee dissatisfaction in the presence of role conflict and role ambiguity, 
This susceptibility to job dissatisfaction associated with new arrivals to the IC is particularly noticeable, 
given the direct relationships found between organizational tenure and overall job satisfaction and four 
of its five component measures. Combined with previous reports that IC personnel perceive limited opportunity 
for advancement into more senior IC positions [Carr, 1988; Rainer, et. al. 1989], these findings indicate 
that much of the dissatisfaction with IC jobs apply primarily to relatively new employees. Therefore, 
it behooves IC managers to pay special attention to the needs of new IC employees. The significant interaction 
effects of education and role ambiguity on satisfaction with work, supervision, and promotion indicate 
that education has a positive influence in improving IC personnel satisfaction with work and their supervision. 
However, education is found to adversely affect satisfaction with promotion in the presence of high role 
ambiguity, This may be due partly to increased socialization and the resulting increased expectations. 
It has been proposed that less educated people are socialized to develop different (lower) job related 
expectations than more educated employees wan Sell, et ,al., 1981 ]. For example, more educated people 
may expect much higher levels of success in a specific occupation, and their expectations may be more 
difficult to satisfy. The significant direct correlation between education and organizational tenure 
may indicate that the higher role ambiguity levels reported by less educated employees may be primarily 
a function of their lower level of experience in the c~rganization rather than their lack of education, 
Overall, the relatively small number of significant moderating effects by personal variables, and role 
stress variables, on job satisfaction, may be a hint that the relationships among role stress, personal 
characteristics and job satisfaction are more complex than the model anticipated. The results of this 
study confirm Baroudi s [1985] findings concerning the efficacy of overall job satisfaction in predicting 
organizational commitment and intentions to leave the cwganization, They also support his findings about 
the direct effects of organizational commitment on intentions to leave. The observed impact of job satisfaction 
on organizational commitment, and propensity to leave, carries a rather straightforward implication. 
The findings confirm the expectations that both job satisfaction and organizaticmal commitment have 
inverse relationships with the IC employees intention to leave [Baroudi, 1985; Bartol, 1983; Dougherty, 
et,al,, 1985; Michaels and Spector, 1982], The data also indicate that, satisfaction/dissatisfaction 
with perceived promotion opportunities and with supervision, is the main motivator for employee s commitment 
to the IC organization and intention to leave. Therefore, organizations can favorably reduce IC personnel 
attrition by properly managing the major components of job satisfaction, particularly the areas of promotion 
and supervision. The finding that role conflict influences overall job satisfaction and four of its components 
measures, with no significant effect on organizational commitment and turnover intentions, suggests that 
role conflict has only indirect influence on organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Nevertheless, 
the data re-enlorces the notion that role conflict constitutes a critical intervening variable affecting 
organizational commitment and turnover intentions through job satisfaction [Baroudi 1985]. Role ambiguity 
has shown direct and moderated effects on IC personnel s organizational commitment and intentions to 
leave, and it is inversely related to job satisfaction. Again, that is consistent with 365 Baroudi s 
findings [Baroudi, 1985] and suggests that role ambiguity is particularly important for IC personnel 
management. IC managers can substantially increase job satisfaction levels, increase their subordinates 
commitment and reduce the latter s intention to leave the IC organization by assuring that IC jobs are 
clearly defined, that IC employees have the necessary information to perform them well, and that any 
particular job does not require incompatible behavior. Furthermore, since role conflict and role ambiguity 
may be conditions germane to the IC environment, IC managers should pay special attention to recruiting 
employees who have relatively high tolerance for both role stressors. Last, IC managers must ensure that 
the levels of role conflict and ambiguity are not raised unnecessarily as a result of poor management 
practices and policies within the IC function. Last, some words of caution and an invitation for further 
research. While achieving its primary purpose of evaluations the antecedents and the consequences of 
job satisfaction within a multivariate context, the results of this study must be interpreted with caution. 
There is need for further research encompassing a wider population of IC employees than those represented 
in the convenience sample used. Specifically, we need a larger sample of IC employees to achieve a greater 
statistical power. That is important to assess the applicability of the findings to the general population 
of IC employees. The sample should perhaps include IC organizations in different stages [Magal, et. al., 
1989], including IC being initiated, which were deliberately excluded from this study, Other IC characteristics 
which are likely to have significance to the study of IC employee satisfaction, organization commitment 
and turnover intention include: the number of employees; whether the IC is located within the IS department, 
within a user department, or it is a separate department; and the level of support [Leitheiser and Wetherbe, 
1986] provided to the end-user community. Furthermore, longitudinal studies involving multiple data points 
should be conducted in order to capture more completely the dynamic processes involved in turnover behavior, 
and the impact of job satisfaction on turnover itself, not only on intentions to leave, Additional research 
is also needed to more thoroughly examine the differences between IC and IS employees, Future models 
should also include job characteristics and involvement, organizational rewards and work performance. 
While these worthwhile research objectives have not been addressed by this study, it provides important 
insights into the role of job satisfaction among IC employees and represents a significant starting point 
for additional research using multivariate causal models to investigate the antecedents and the consequences 
of job satisfaction. REFERENCES <RefA>Abelson, M.A., Examination of Avoidable and Unavoidable Turnover, Journa/
