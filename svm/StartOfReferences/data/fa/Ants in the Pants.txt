crawling over them. Many of us would become horrified to realize that a feeling ticklishness on the skin 
was caused by insects. However, many of us have had the experience of playing with ants when we were 
children. This might indicate that an apparently disagreeable sensation can sometimes changes to being 
a funny, thrilling, or even a pleasant experience. The aim of our work is to highlight this fact, and 
to create a new entertainment that we have, named Ants in the Pants (Figure 1). This is a system composed 
of a visual display with a touch senor and a wearable tactile display. Figure 1. Ants in the Pants 2. 
Exposition 2.1. Ticklish tactile display We made our original tactile display (Figure 2) because the 
stimulus given by the legs and antennas of an insect are actually a very soft tickle that previous tactile 
displays have not been able to generate. Our tactile display is a glove with a matrix of motors inside. 
Brushes made up of two fishing lines with some elasticity are attached on the motors. In this way a realistic 
insect s legs feeling can be realized. The brushes touch the skin when the motor rotates. After giving 
the stimulus, the motor rotates backward. The glove covers and wraps the hand and forearm, with the stimulating 
points are arranged on the back of the hand and forearm. The distance between each motor (20mm) is set 
to be shorter than the two-point discrimination thresholds on the arm [1]. By using this distance, spatially 
continuous motion can be expressed. Figure 2. Ticklish tactile display 2.2. Interactive system One can 
see many ants living in the visual display. When ones hand is placed on the display with the glove, its 
position is detected by the touch sensor and the ants gather around the hand. Just after the ant reaches 
the hand and then disappears, one begins to feel a sensation, as if the ant is crawling up your arm. 
As ants have a habit of climbing up almost anything, once they started moving on ones hand they would 
soon move up to the arm. When the hand is raised, the crawl back onto the hand. Then if one puts ones 
hand back on the display for a while, more ants will enter into the glove. A good feature is that if 
the user feels bad or sick, by shaking the hand, the ants are shaken off. 3. Conclusion We proposed a 
new entertainment system that we call Ants in the Pants to produce a thrilling sensation that imparts 
a feeling that Insects are crawling over the user s body . To achieve this, we developed a new wearable 
tactile interface and combined it with a visual display with a touch sensor to create an interactive 
system. We have already tested the system with more than 300 people. Although some users said It is creepy 
, almost everyone tried it again and again. This indicates that our system succeeded in changing an apparently 
unpleasant situation into a new and addictive entertainment. References <RefA>1. <SinRef><author>Weinstein.S</author>, <title>Intensive and
