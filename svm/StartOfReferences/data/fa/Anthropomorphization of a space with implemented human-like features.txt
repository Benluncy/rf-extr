 § ¶ Figure 1: Anthropomophization of Several Spaces 1 Introduction We propose an anthropomorphization 
method that uses at­tachable human-like features like eyes and arms. These fea­tures are attached to 
the target, making it into an anthro­pomorphic agent, and providing the target s information to users 
intuitively. The anthropomorphized space can use ges­tures, pointing, emotion, and expression to initiate 
interac­tion. We implemented robotic human-like parts for anthropomor­phization and designed authroing 
tool that authors commu­nication contents for embodied home appliance. Users easily convert an object 
into embodied agent and create their own contents interactively to the agent by our method. 2 Features 
By our method, a user accepts a target s intention and imag­inary body image. Our proposed method, in 
comparison to the use of an independent agent, is also better at gaining the attention of users for explaining 
the functions of arti-facts[Osawa et al. 2009]. It is also possible to use metaphors for pointing at 
the lo­cation of an artifact by our method. For example, the printer can say I have a stomachache when 
it is jammed. These metaphors would be impossible to use for normal ex­planation using an independent 
agent. If we study these metaphors more closely, we might be able to use more un­derstandable expressions 
for the artifact using our method. This method also indirectly avoids an uncanny valley which is strong 
repulsion between an industrial robot and a hu­man[Mori 1970]. Using human-like features, we can verify 
separately what parts or actions of parts are positive and empathic for users and what parts or actions 
are negative. We can research anthropomorphization that is not uncanny *e-mail: osawa@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp

 3 Principle Our system consists of a camera, a skin-sensor, human-like eye-parts, human-like arm-parts, 
mouth-parts, and a com­puter. Our anthropomorphized object did not need to ma­nipulate other objects 
using its attahed hands. Because the target already has its own task, and our devices are used for just 
expressionism. Instead of manipulation, these devices must be simple and light so they can be easily 
attached. We developed human-like robotic devices and attached them to our target by using hook and loop 
fasteners. Our system uses a Bluetooth connection to each body part. Our sys­tem uses a visual marker-detection 
technique by ARToolKit for calculating positions of each part and pointing targets [ARToolKit ]. 4 Conclusion 
We proposed the anthropomorphization method and the au­thoring tool. In future, we conducted user study 
with non experts to evaluate our tool. Acknowledgements The .rst author was supported in part by the
