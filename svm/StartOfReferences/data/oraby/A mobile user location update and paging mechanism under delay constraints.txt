LA size given the respective costs for location update and terminal paging is introduced in [8]. However, 
under the LA based scheme, terminals located close to an LA bound­ary may perform excessive location 
updates as they move back and forth between two LAs. Besidesl the optimal LA size should be terminal 
dependent as mo­bility and calling patterns vary among users. It is not generally easy to use different 
LA sizes for different ter­minals. Three location update schemes are examined in [3]: time based, movement 
based and dzstance based. Un­der these three schemes, location updates are performed based on the time 
elapsed, the number of movements performed, and the distance traveled, respectively, since the last location 
update. Results demonstrated that the distance based scheme produces the best result. How­ever, the model 
considered in [3] is very simplified. For example, in [3] incoming calls are not taken into account, 
Moreover, paging delay is not constrained. A distance based location update scheme is introduced in [6] 
where an iterative algorithm that can generate the optimal threshold dist ante resulting in the minimum 
cost. How­ever, the number of iterations required for the algorithm to converge varies widely depending 
on the mobility and call arrival probability parameters considered. Besides, as in [3], paging delay 
is not constrained. The time required to locate a mobile terminal is directly propor­tional to the distance 
traveled by the mobile terminal since its last location update. A dynamic location up­date mechanism 
is introduced in [1] where the location update time based on data obtained on-line is dynam­ically determined. 
It is demonstrated that the result obtained is close to the optimal result given in [6]. Com­putation 
required by this mechanism is minimal. It is, therefore, feasible to implement this scheme in mobile 
terminals that have limited computing power. Similar to other schemes described above, the drawback of 
this scheme is that paging delay is not explicitly considered. In [7], paging subject to delay constraints 
is consid­ered. Results demonstrate that when delay is uncon­strained, the highest-probability-first 
scheme incurs the minimum cost. For the constrained delay case, the au­thors determine the optimal polling 
sequence that re­sults in minimum cost. The authors, however, assume that the probability distribution 
of user location is pro­vided. This probability distribution may be user depen­dent. A location update 
and terminal paging scheme that facilitates derivation of this probability distribution is needed in 
order to apply the paging scheme gi>-en in [7]. Besides, the trade off between location update and terminal 
paging is not considered in [7], In this paper, we introduce a location management scheme that combines 
a distance based location update mechanism with a paging scheme which guarantees a pre-defined maximum 
delay requirement. We propose a Markovian model which captures the mobility and call arrival patterns 
of a particular terminal. Based on this model, we obtain the average location update and ter­minal paging 
costs. We use an iterative algorithm to de­termine the optimal location update threshold clistance that 
will result in the minimum average total cost. We provide numerical results that, demonstrate the trade 
off between high and low delay bounds under various pa­rameter values. This paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we describe the mobility model ancl the location update ancl paging schemes. Sections 3 
and 4 describe a Markov chain model for the one-and two-dimensional PCN cov­erage area, respectively. 
Solutions for the steady state probabilities of the hlarkov chain are also presented. Section 5 describes 
a method for deriving the total lo­cation update and paging cost. A method for obtaining the optimal 
location update threshold distance is given in Section 6. Section 7 presents the numerical results. the 
conclusion is given in Section 8. 2 System Description 2.1 Terminal Mobility In this paper, we consider 
both one-and two­dimensional mobility models. The one-dimensional model is suitable for situations where 
the mobility of mobile terminals is restricted to two directions (forward and backward). Examples include 
roads, tunnels, train and train stations. The two-dimensional mode] is suit­able for more general case 
where terminals can travel in any direction within a coverage area (such as a city), We assume that the 
PCN coverage area is divided into cells according to: One-Dimensional Model: The one-dimensional space 
is divided into cells of the same length. Each cell has two neighbors. Figure l(a) shows the cell partition 
in a one­dimensional coverage area The numbers represent the distance of each cell from cell (-l and 
are discussed later in this section. Two-Dinlensional Model: The two dimensional space is divided into 
hexagonal cells of the same size. Each cell has six neighbors. Figure 1(b) shows the cell partition in 
the two-dimensional coverage area. The size of each cell is determined based on the number of mobile 
subscribers, the number of channek available per cell and the channel allocation scheme used. In this 
paper we concentrate on finding the optimal location update distance assuming that the size of cells 
is given, Our scheme works both in the macrocell and the ml­ 543 2 10 I2345 (.) (b) Figure 1: (a) One-Dimensional 
Model and (b) Two-Dirnensional Model. crocell environment. We note that if the size of cells is small, 
the probability of movement (to be discussed later in this section) will be high and vice versa. We consider 
a wide range of values for the probability of movement in the numerical examples given in Section 7. 
Here we introduce the concept of a rzng. As it is shown in Figure l(b), each cell is surrounded by rings 
of cells. If we select cell O (as indicated) as the center, cells labeled 1 form the first ring around 
cell O. Cells labeled 2 form the second ring around cell O, and so on. Each ring is labeled according 
to its distance from the center such that ring rl refers to the first ring away from cell O. In general, 
if we consider cell O as a ring itself, then ring r, (i = 0, 1, 2... ) refers to the ith ring away from 
the center. We assume that the distance of each cell from the center cell is measured in terms of num­ber 
of rings such that cells in ring r, are i rings away from the center. The distance (in terms of the number 
of rings) of each cell from cell (1 is given in Figure l(b). For the one-dimensional model, even though 
cells do not form physical rings, we will use the same terminology as in the two-dimensional case. As 
shown in Figure 1(a), cells labeled i belong to ring r~. The distances (in term of the number of rings) 
of each cell from cell O is indicated in Figure 1(a). Unless specified otherwise, all dist antes mentioned 
in this paper are measured in terms of rings. We will not explicitly indicate the unit of distance here­after. 
We define g(d) to be the number of cells that are within a distance of d from any given cell (including 
this cell) in the coverage area: for l-dim. model, d = O, 1,2... (d) = ~~(~~ 1) + 1 for 2-dim. model, 
d = 0, 1,2... { (1) Mobile users travel from cell to cell within the PCN 246 coverage area. In this 
paper, we assume the mobility of each terminal to follow a discrete-time random walk model as described 
below: At discrete times t, a user moves to one of the neighb­oring cells with probability g or stay 
at the current, cell with probability 1 y. If the user decides to move to another cell, there is equal 
probability for any one of the ne@bormg cells to be selected as the destination. This probability is 
~ in the one-dimensional model and ~ in the two­dimensional model. As compared to the fluid flow model 
reported in [8], the random walk model is more appropriate as most of the mobile subscribers in a PCN 
are likely to be pedestri­ans. The fluid flow model is more suitable for vehicle traffic such that a 
continuous movement with infrequent speed and direction changes are expected. For pedes­trian movements 
such that mobility is generally confined to a limited geographical area while frequent stop-and­go as 
well as direction changes are common, the random walk model is more appropriate. Similar random walk 
models are also reported in [1, 3. 6]. Incoming calls may arrive during each discrete time t. We assume 
that the incoming call arrivals for each mobile terminal are geo­metrically distributed and that the 
probability of a call arrival during each discrete time t is c. We also assume that the location identifier 
of a cell is broadcast by the base station periodically so that every mobile terminal knows exactly lts 
own location at any ,g]~en time Each mobile terminal reports its location to the network ac­cording to 
the location update scheme to be described in Section 2.2. The network stores each mobile ternli­ nal 
s location in a database whenever such information is available. 2.2 Location Update and Terminal Paging 
Mechanism We define the center cell (cell O) of a mobile terminal to be the cell at which the terminal 
last reported its lo­cation to the network. A distance based location update mechanism is used such that 
a terminal will report its location when its distance from the center cell exceeds a threshold d. This 
location update scheme guarantees that the terminal is located in an area that is within a dist ante 
d from the center cell, This area is called the reszdtng area of the terminal. In order to determme if 
a terminal is located in a particular celll the network performs the following steps: 1. Sends a polling 
signal to the target cell and waits until a timeout occurs. 2. If a reply is received before timeout, 
the destination terminal is located in the target cell. 3. If no reply is received, the destination 
terminal is not in the target cell.  We call the above process the polhng cycie. For simplic­ity, we 
define a maximum paging clelay of m to mean that the network must be able to locate the destination terminal 
within m polling cycles. When an incoming call arrives, the network first partitions the residing area 
of the terminal into a number of subareas (a method for partitioning the residing area into subareas 
will be de­scribed next ) and polls each subarea one after another until the terminal is found. We denote 
subarea j by .4j where the subscript in­dicates the order in which the subarea will be polled. Each subarea 
contains one or more rings and each ring cannot be included in more than one subarea. As dis­cussed in 
Section 2.1, ring r, (r = 0, 1, 2... ) consists of all cells that are a distance of i away from the center 
cell. For a threshold distance of d, the number of rings in the residing area is (d + 1). If paging delay 
is not constrained, we assign exactly one ring to each subarea. The residing area is, therefore, partitioned 
into (d+ 1) subareas. However, if paging delay is constrained to a maximum of m polling cycles, the number 
of subareas cannot exceed m. Otherwise, we may not be able to locate the terminal in less than or equal 
to m polling cycles. Given a threshold distance of d and a maximum paging delay of m, the number of subareas, 
denoted by 1, is: .l=min(d+l, m) (2) We partition the residing area according to the following steps: 
1. Determine the number of rings in each subarea by q=l~j. 2. Assign ~ rings to each subarea (except 
the last sub­area) such that subarea .47 ( 1 < j < f 1) is as­signed rings r~~j _ 1) to rn~ 1. 3. 
Assign the rernaming rings to subarea .4<.  The partitioning scheme described above is based on a shortest-distance-first, 
(SDF) order such that rings closer to the center cell are polled first. It is shown in [7] that in order 
to minimize paging cost, the more prob­able locations should be polled first. lTnder the mo­bility model 
described in subsection 2.1, in most cases there is a higher probability of finding a terminal in a cell 
that is closer to the center cell than in a cell that is further away. Our partitioning scheme is, therefore, 
analogous to a more-probable-first scheme. It is shown in Section 7 that, under our partitioning scheme, 
signif­icant gain can be achievecl when the mammum paging delay is increased only slightly from its minimum 
value of one polling cycle. We stress that our method of de­termining the optimal threshold distance 
is not limited to this SDF scheme. Since we can determine the prob­ability distribution of terminal location 
in the residing area, our mechanism can determine the optimal thresh­ old distance when any other partitioning 
schemes are used. In the following sections, we determine the optimal threshold distance that results 
in the minimum total lo­cation update and terminal paging cost. The following two steps are taken in 
deriving this optimal threshold distance: e Determine the probability distribution of terminal location 
within the residing area using a Markov chain model. This information is useful in finding the average 
total cost. e Determine the average total cost as a function of threshold distance and maximum paging 
delay and locate the optimal threshold distance using an iter­ative algorithm. 3 One-Dimensional Mobility 
Model 3.1 Markov Chain Model We setup a discrete-time Markov chain model to cap­ture the mobility and 
call arrival patterns of a terminal. Figure 2 gives the Markov chain model when the loca­tion update 
threshold distance is d. The state of the Markov chain i (i > 0) is defined as the distance be­tween 
the current location of the mobile terminal and its center cell. This state is equivalent to the index 
of the ring in which the mobile terminal is located AS a result, the mobile terminal is in state i if 
it, is currently residing in ring r,. The transition probabilities a,,, +l and bt,, _l represent the 
probabilities at which the dis­tance of the terminal from its center cell increases and decreases, respectively. 
As described before, c denotes the probability of a call arrival. Transitions from a state to one of 
its two neighboring states represent movements of the terminal away from a cell. A transition from any 
state to state O represents either the arrival of a call or the occurrence of a location update when 
the threshold distance d is exceeded. When a call arrives, the network determines the current location 
of the mobile terminal by paging and, as a result, the center cell is reset to the current cell location 
of the mobile terminal. Similarly, the center cell is reset when a location update occurs. Figure 2: 
Markov chain model In both cases, the center cell becomes the current lo­cation of the mobile terminal 
and the new state of the terminal is therefore O. The transition probabilities of the discrete-time Markov 
chain are given as: ifi=() q a~,~+l = (3) ~ ifl<i~d { We assume pz,d (O ~ i ~ d) to be the steady state 
probability of state z when the maximum threshold dis­tance is cl. The balance equations for the Markov 
chain are given as: PO,d~O)l = Pl,dh, o +pd, d~d)d+l + c Pk,d (5) $ k=l Pd, d(ad, d+l + ~d,d 1 + c) =

equations (5-7) and the transition probability equations (3) and (4), the steady state prob­abilities 
of the Marlcov chain can be obtained. The closed form expressions for the steady state probabili­ties 
are given in the next subsection. The probability y of state d is particularly important in determining 
the location update cost. As will be described in Section 5, the location update cost can be obtained 
given the value of pd, d. In the following subsection, we will first solve for the equation of pd,~. 
The steady state probabilities of other states will be derived in terms of pd,d. These closed form expressions 
allow us to determine the loca­tion update and terminal paging costs in a more effective manner. 3.2 
Steady State Probabilities Based on equation (7), we can obtain the steacly state probabilities for state 
(z + 1) (1 s i ~ d 1 ) in terms of the steady state probabilities of states i and (i 1 ) according 
to the following expression: for O<i<d (8) Substituting the transition probabilities given by equa­tions 
(3) and (4) in equation (8), the following equation for pl+l,d 1s obtained: forl<i<d (9) Pz+l, d = ffp%,d 
 Pt l,d where a is given as: 10) Equation (9) can be applied recursively to obtain the steady state 
probabilities for state i (where 2 s i < d) in terms of the steady state probabilities of states 1 and

last part of equatlou ( 12) MLll­tiplying each side of equation ( 12) by s and summing both sides of 
the equation from 2 to x, we obtain the following: We can now make use of the initial conditions of S, 
as given in equation (12) to obtain the Z-transform of S,, denoted by S(~), as: Taking the inverse Z-transform 
of the abo~re equation, the closed form equation for S, can be obtained as: 1+1 1+1 s,=% e? (15)el e? 
where el and ez ar~ the roots of the quadratic equation Z2 _ cr~ + 1, which is the denominator of S(z), 
and is given as: e,= ;(Q+ Y=) (16) Making use of equations (11) and ( 15), we can obtain the steady state 
probabilities of states u! and (d 1 ) as follows: d_ 2 d ~d 1 d 1 eq el e? Pd,d= 1 -p~,d Pl,del e~ el

will be used, together with the equations to be derived later, to solve for the steady state probabilities 
of the Markov cilain. Rearranging equations (5) and (7) with i = 1, results in the following expression 
for pd,d in terms of pl ,d and P?)d: 1 Pd,d = (j~z l)pl,d +p?,d (a 2) ford>l (20) Another expression 
for pd,d can be obtained by substi­tuting the transition probabilities in equation (6) as fol­lows: 1 
 pd,d = ;Pd-l, d ford>l (21) Substitute p&#38;l,d as given by equation (19) in equa­tion (21) results: 
for d >2 (22) Equations (18), (20) and (22) are three different expres­sions for pd,d as a function 
of pl,~ and ~z,d. Since we have three equations and three unlinowns, the solution for ~d,d can be obtained: 
RlR3 R; pd,d = Ii_~ K2R1 -t-K3Rz i-K4Rs -t 2R] R3 2R; for d >2 (23) where R% and K1 to K4 are defined

K4 = a(el ez) (28) 249 We can further obtain the expressions for po)d, Pl,d and Iz,d ill term of Pd,d 
using equations ( 18), (20), (22) and (7). The results are given below: R1CY2 2RZQ + Rs p(I,d = Rd_~Pd,d

Pi,d = R&#38;@d,d R; R1R3 for2<i <d, d> 2(32) Since the transition probability U,,,+ i. has a different, 
value when i = O compared to when i > 0, the steady state probability equations (23)-(32) are valid only 
for threshold dist ante larger than 2. When the threshold distance is smaller than or equal to 2, we 
solve the steady state probabilities directly from the balance equations. The steady state probabilities 
for the threshold distances of O, 1 and 2 are given below: d=O: po)rl = 1.0 (33) d=l: q+c Po,l = (34]

= 9q~ + l 2yc + 4c~ When the threshold distance d is greater than or equal to 3, equation (32) gives 
the steady state probability for states 3 through (d 1). Equations (29). (30), (31) and (23) give the 
steady state probabilities for states (),1,2 and d, respectively. When the threshold distance d is smaller 
than 3, equations (33) to (3S) are used to determine the steady state probabilities. Ccnlcr ccl I RIIIg

Mobility Model  4.1 Markov Chain Model The Markov chain model given in Figure 2 and the balance equations 
(5)-(7) are valid for the two­dirnensional moclel. However, in the two-dimensional model, the transition 
probabilities at,, +l and b,, i,_l are state dependent. Figure 3(a ) shows the cells in ring rl. There 
are 6 hexagonal cells in ring rl and each cell has 6 edges. This results in a total of 36 edges. It can 
be seen from Figure 3(a) that 12 of these edges are between cells belonging to the same ring. There are 
6 edges at the in­side perimeter of the ring and there are 18 edges at the outside perimeter of the ring. 
Given that the terminal is at one of the cells in ring rl, the probabilities that a movement will result 
in an increase or decrease of the distance from the center cell are ~ and ~, respectively. Similarly, 
Figure 3(b) shows the cells in ring rj. If the terminal is located in ring rz, the probabilities that 
a movement will result in an increase or decrease of the distance from the center cell are ~ and ~, respectively. 
In general, given that the mobile terminal is located in ring r,, the probabilities that a movement will 
result in an increase or decrease in the distance from the center cell, denoted by p+ (i) and p (i), 
respectively, are given as:  p+(i)=;+; (39) ~-(i)=; ; (40) The transition probabilities for the two-dimensional 
model are given as follows: (42) probabilities recursively by expressing the probability of each state 
in terms of the probability of state d. The law of total probability can then be used to solve for the 
value of pd, d. We refer to the solution obtained by this recursive method the e~acf solutlon For the 
two-dimensional model, however, a simple closed form expression for the steady state probabilities may 
be dif­ficult to obtain. In the next subsection, we will sol~e for the approximate closed form solutions 
for the steady state probabilities. This approximate solution is useful in determining the optimal threshold 
distance. 4.2 Approximate Solution for Steady State Probability ies In order to obtain the approximate 
steady state prob­abilities for the two-dimensional model, we modify the transition probability y equations 
(41) and (42) as follows: (43) b,,t-l = ; (44) Here we omit the &#38; terms in a,,, +l and b,,, _ 1 expres­sions. 
The effect of this modification is more signifi­cant when i is small. When i is large, the value of &#38; 
is negligible. For example, for q = 0.1 and i = 5, &#38; = 3,33 x 10 3. In the rnacrocell environment 
wheN the size of cells is large, the movement probability q IS relatively small. The value of &#38; is 
small even for small values of i. In the microcell environment where size of cells is small, the probability 
of moving to a neighboring cell, q, is relatively high. Because of the large proba­bility of movement, 
cells are usually further away from the center cell. This means that the state, i, of a mobile terminal 
is relatively large and &#38; is small because of a large value of i. In Section 7 we demonstrate that 
the optimal threshold distance obtained using these approx­imate transition probabilities differs from 
that obtained using the exact transition probabilities only by 1 rmg or less most of the times. Exactly 
the same steps (as in the one-dimensional model) can be used to solve for the approximate closed form 
expressions here. We. therefore, skip the steps and the approximate steady state equations are given 
as fol­ lows: d~3: Given the balance equations and the above transition probability equations, we can

costs The steady state probabilities obtained in the pre­vious section allow us to determine the cost 
associated with both location update and terminal paging for a given threshold distance and maximum paging 
delay pa­rameters. Now we first look into the case where maxi­mum paging delay is at its minimum of one 
polling cy­cle. This delay bound is of special interest because a delay of one polling cycle is also 
provided by the LA based scheme [8]. Results can be used to compare our scheme with the LA based scheme. 
We will also extend our result to obtain the terminal paging cost, when the maximum delay is higher than 
one polling cycle. Assume that the costs for performing a location up­date and for polling a cell are 
CT and P , respectively. Given a threshold distance d, we denote the average lo­cation update cost by 
Cl, ( d). The average location up­date cost can be determined by multiplying Cr by the probability at 
which the terminal exceeds the threshold distance given below: c~(d) = Pd,dad,d+lu (61) The average 
terminal paging cost, C. ( d, m), is a function of both the threshold distance, d, and the maximum paging 
delay, m. When the maximum paging delay is one polling cycle, the network has to poll all cells in the 
destination terminal s residing area at, the same time. The average terminal paging cost as a function 
of the threshold distance d for a maximum delay of one polling cycle is then: C u(d, 1)= cg(d)v (62) 
 where c is the call arrival probability and g( cl) is the number of cells that are within a distance 
of d from the center cell. The expression of g(d) is given in equa­tion ( 1). When the maximum paging 
delay is higher than one polling cycle, the residing area is partitioned into a number of subareas such 
that each subarea con­sists of one or more rings (as described in Section 2.) A mobile terminal is at 
ring ~i when its distance from its center cell is i. The probability that the mobile terminal is in ring 
ri is, therefore, equal to the steady state prob­ability of state i, p, ,d. The probability y that a 
terminal is located in subarea .4,7 given a threshold distance of d is: (63) We denote the number of 
cells in subarea Aj by iV(.4j ), Given that the terminal is residing in subarea Aj, the number of cells 
polled before the terminal is successfully located is: u,= 5 N(il,) (64) k=l Then, the average paging 
cost can be calculated as fol­lows: c.(d, m) = CL-~~,,dlo, (65) i=l The average total cost jor locatzon 
update and termznal pagtng is: ~T(d, ?n) = c.(d) + C,, (d, m) (66) Optimal Threshold Distance number 
in [0,1), the repiace((d, d ), Ad) routine is given as follows: The results obtained in Section 5 let 
us determine the average total cost CT (d, m), equation (66), for loca­tion update and terminal paging 
given a threshold dis­tance d and maximum paging delay m. Analytical re­sults demonstrate that, depending 
on the method used to partition the residing area of the terminal, the total cost curve may have local 
minimum. We, therefore, can­not use gradient decent methods to locate the optimal distance. One way of 
determining the optimal thresh­old distance is to limit the location update distance to a predefine maximum 
D. The optimal location update distance can then be found by evaluating the total cost for each of the 
allowed threshold distances O s d s D. The threshold distance that results in the minimum to­tal costs 
is selected as the optimal distance d*. Limit­ing the threshold distance to a maximum value may not have 
significant effect on the total cost. For typical call arrival and mobility values, the optimal distance 
rarely exceeds 50. Besides, the size of a local coverage area is usually limited to the boundary of a 
city, it is realistic to require the mobile terminal to perform a location update before it leaves the 
local coverage area. This method can always locate the optimal distance in D + 1 iterations. Another 
method for determining the optimal thresh­old distance is an iterative algorithm called simulated annealing 
[2, 5]. In simulated annealing, potential so­lutions are generated and compared in every iteration. This 
potential solution is accepted or rejected proba­bilistically consistent with the Boltzmann distribution 
law involving a temperature T. During the course of the annealing, T k reduced according to a coolang 
schedule. When a suitably low temperature is finally reached, the algorithm terminates on an optimal 
or near optimal so­lution. The algorithmic structure of simulated annealing is given as follows: T+--l; 
d -RandomJnzto; k-l; do d -generate(d); Ad+ total_cost(d) -total_cost(d ); d + reptace((d, d ), Ad); 
TF$; k +k+l; while(T > eztt-T) To start the annealing process, a random threshold dis­t ante is generated 
by the Randorn_Init( ) routine. The generate(d) routine returns a threshold distance value close to d. 
Based on equation (66), total-cost(d) returns the average total cost for location update and terminal 
paging given the threshold distance d. The values of y and exit-T are adjusted based on the required 
accuracy of the result. Assume that rando returns a random replace((d, d ), Ad) if Ad z O return d ; 
if (rand( ) < ezp((Ad/T)) return cl ; return d; Due to space limitation, we will not explain m detail 
the theory behind simulated annealing. Interested read­ers may refer to [2, 5]. We note that simulated 
annealing is not the only method available for finding the global minimum of a discrete function. There 
are other opti­mization methods reported m literature [4]. These meth­ods can find the optimal threshold 
distance at varying degrees of speed and efficiency. 7 Analytical Results We first present the numerical 
results for both the one-and two-dimensional model using some typical pa­rameters. For the two-dimensional 
model, the exact steady state probability solutions (discussed in Sec­tion 4.1) are used. Figures 4(a) 
and 4(b) show the av­erage total cost as the probability of moving is varied from 0.001 to 0.5. The call 
arrival probability, locatlon update cost and paging cost are fixed at 0.01, 100 and 1, respectively. 
We consider three maximum paging delay bounds (1,2 and 3 polling cycles, respectively) as well as the 
case of unconstrained delay. In all cases, the av­erage total cost increases as the probability of moving 
increases. The cost is the highest when the maximum paging delay is 1 polling cycle. As the maximum pag­ing 
delay increases, the average total cost drops The reduction in cost is significant even for a maximum 
pag­ing delay of only 2 polling cycles. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) present similar results for the one-and 
two-climenslonal models, respectively. However, the probability of mov­ing is fixed at 0.05 and the call 
arrival probability is varied between 0.001 and 0.1. The average total cost increases as the call arrival 
probability increases. Dis­continuities appear in some curves due to the sudden changes in the optimal 
threshold distances. As in the case of Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the average total cost de­creases as the 
maximum paging delay increases. The decrease is more significant when the maximum paging delay increases 
from 1 to 2 polling cycles than from 2 to 3 polling cycles. This demonstrates that a large maxi­mum paging 
delay is not necessary to obtain significant reduction in cost. In most cases, the average total costs 
are very close to the minimum value (when there is no paging delay bound ) when a maximum paging delay 
of 3 polling cycles is used. Table 1 shows the optimal threshold distances and the associated average 
total cost Yalues for the one­ delay = 1 delay = 2 delay = 3 unbounded b d C Td*c~ d CT d CT 1 II ()125

scheme subject to delay con­straints. The mobility of each terminal is modeled by a Markov chain model 
and the probability distribution of terminal location is derived. Based on this, we obtain the average 
total location update and terminal paging cost under given threshold distance and maximum de­lay constraint. 
Given this average total cost function. we determine the optimal threshold distance by using an iterative 
algorithm. Results demonstrated that the optimal cost decreases as the maximum delay increases. However, 
a small increase of the maximum delay from 1 to 2 polling cycles can lower the optimal cost, to half 
way between its values when the maximum delays are 1 and co (no delay bound ) polling cycles, respectively. 
Most previous schelmes assulme that paging delay is either unconstrained (such as [1, 3]) or confined 
to one polling cycle (such as [8]). In the former case, it may take arbitrarily long to locate a mobile 
terminal. While in the latter case, the network cannot take advantage of situations when the PCN can 
tolerate delay of higher than one polling cycle. Our scheme is more realistic as the maximum paging delay 
can be selected based on the Table 2: Optimal Threshold Distance and Average delay = 1 delay = 3 unbounded

paper can be applied in static location update schemes such that the network deter­mines the location 
update threshold distance according to the average call arrival and movement probabilities of all the 
users. This result can also be used in dynamic schemes such that location update threshold distance is 
determined continuously on a per-user basis. Future research includes the simplification of the threshold 
distance optimization process such that our mechanism can be implemented in mobile terminals with limited 
power supply. Also, an optimal method for parti­tioning the residing area of the terminal should be devel­oped. 
In any case, our method for obtaining the optimal location update threshold distance is not limited to 
the partitioning scheme described in this paper. The total cost and hence the optimal threshold distance 
can be ob­ tained by our method when other partitioning methods are used. Acknowledgement We would like
