fuzzy set, possibility theory Abstract This paper presents a fuzzy information retrieval and management 
systems (FIRMS) we have developped for handling fuzzy objects. The originalities of this system consist 
of : i) the possibility to describe object with fuzzy aggregate attributes and to retrieve them at differ- 
ent description-levels of these attributes, ii) the defini- tion of nuanced domain which gives the possible 
values of a fuzzy attribute, iii) the using of a fuzzy thesaurus and an associated grammar to go through 
its links in order to retrieve objects . In another hand, this paper explains how to build an application 
with this system and shows some real appli- cations of FIRMS. INTRODUCTION Vagueness and uncertainty 
are usual in the human knowl- edge and reasoning. Then it is necessary to handle these fuzzy data in 
databases when they are the only infor- mation known about the world to model. During the last years, 
several approaches (see [9] and [3] for exam- ple) have proposed extension of databases to take into 
account this imperfection of real world. Allmost of this approaches use the concept of fuzzy set [10] 
and possibil- ity theory [11]. "Permission to make digital/hard copy of all or part of this material

information retrieval and management system called FIRMS. In the first section, we present the basic 
concepts of our system whence the original concepts of aggregate attribute and fuzzy thesaurus. In the 
second section, we present the modelling process of an application, an appli- cation being a set of fuzzy 
object. In the last section, we present real applications of FIRMS in economic fields. 1 MAIN BASIC CONCEPTS 
OF FIRMS FIRMS allows to describe a set of objects defined by a collection of attributes. For instance, 
John is an object defined by the attributes Name, age, .... An attribute can take a fuzzy value called 
a nuanced value. In the first subsection, we give th three kinds of attributes used by FIRMS. In the 
second, we explain the concept of nuanced domaingrouping the possible values of an attribute. In the 
third subsection, we introduce the notion of fuzzy thesaurus as a particular nuanced domain. In the last 
subsection, we show the description of a fuzzy object. 1.1 Attributes An attribute (name, age, ... ) 
can have three different forms : basic attribute, calculated attribute and aggre- gate attribute. Briefly, 
we explain these three different kinds of attributes. Basic attribute : A basic attribute is an attribute 
which can't be cal- culated from the values of other attributes or com- posed by other attributes. It 
is the case when user must provide the attribute value. For instance, name of somebody, turnover for 
a firms, ... Number of fem- inine strength can be view as a basic attribute too, but if we consider its 
value is calculated, for instance from total strength and masculine strength, then it isn't a basic 
attribute. A basic attribute is represented by a couple (a, Dora(a)) where a is the name of attribute 
and Dora(a) is its domain. Calculated attribute An attribute a is called calculated attribute if there 
exists a function v~ permitting to calculate its value. We represent such attributes by a triplet  
 (a, Dora(a), va). Example : feminine strength = total strength -mas-culine strength. Aggregate attribute 
An aggregate attribute a [6] is an attribute composed with a set of attributes. This set is noted Agg(a). 
To each aggregate attribute a we associate a function, note va, to aggregate the attributes values of 
Agg(a) for giving the value of a. The representation of an aggregate attribute a is a quadruple (a, 
Dora(a), va, Agg(a) ). Obviously, the elements of set Agg(a) can be either basic attributes, calculated 
attributes or aggregate attributes. Example : the knowledge level of a language can be decomposed with 
speak level, read level and write level. The global level can be the result of the average from these 
three levels. 1.2 Nuanced Domain The domain of an attribute is the set of its possible nu- anced values, 
h nuanced value is a couple (v, n) where v is a crisp, imprecise or vague value and n is a nuance which 
either expresses uncertainty (e.g., probably, ... ) or linguistic quantifiers/modifiers [1] (e.g., very, 
often, ... ). We explain these notions in the following. First, we remind of fuzzy set concept. A fuzzy 
set A in X is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function #a(x) which associates with each 
element in X a real number in the interval [0, 1], with the value of #a(x) at x representing the "grade 
of membership" of x in A [101. A crisp value v of an universe U can be viewed as a classical set reduced 
to one element and characterized by : 1 ifx=v #~(x) = 0 else An imprecise value v of an universe U can 
be viewed as a classical set characterized by the following function : ,o(x) = 0 or 1 and a( l,x2) e 
U 2, Xl # = #v(X2) = 1. In other words, the set contains two elements at least. A vague value v of an 
universe U is defined by a fuzzy set and characterized by the following function : #~ (x) E [0, 1] such 
that : 3xEU #v(x)=l; 3xEU 0<#,(x)<l. The above definitions are valid in a query. In an ob- ject description, 
we characterize the values by possibility distributions [2]. A possibility distribution allows to in- 
dicate the degree of possibility to each element, but only one of these element is exact for the value. 
We note 7rv the possibility distribution associated with the value v. A nuance n is characterized by 
a function f, defined on the set of characteristic functions, noted CF. If a (crisp or imprecise or vague) 
value v is characterized by Pv then the characteristic function of n on v is f,(#,). See four examples 
about these notions : example 1 : "John is 175cm tall" 175cm is a precise value represented by the function 
(figure 1) : 1 if x = 175 7r175(x) = 0 else 'T.............. T 0 175cm Figure 1:175 cm example 2 : 
"Height of John is between 172 and 178cm" "Between 172 and 178cm" (or [172,178]) is an im-precise value 
represented by the following function (figure 2) : 1 if 172<x<178 7r[172'178](x) = 0 else I:1.........! 
 72cra 178cm L Figure 2: Between 172 and 178 cm * example 3 : "John is tall" "Tall" is a vague value 
represented by the following function : (figure 3). 175cm 180cm Figure 3: Tall example 4 : "John is 
very tall" "Very tall" is a nuanced value, (tall, very), defined by (figure 4) : = - 0 tSOcm 185cm Figure 
4: Very tall Let us now present our main result of this study which provides a general definition to 
represent domain of a nu- anced attribute a : Dora(a) = {(na, 77)} U Refbase x Nbase[UiEi x Nil where 
 na is a term meaning "not applicable" closes to the concept of "extra element" used by Dubois and Prade 
[2];  rl is a particular nuance meaning "no applied nuance" = =);  Refbase is the basic universe of 
domain, i.e. a set of crisp values;  Nbase is a set of possible nuances on the elements of Refbase, 
this set contains r/at least;  Ei are sets of vague values;  Ni are sets of possible nuances on vague 
values of Ei, these sets contain rl at least;  brackets indicate an optional part.  Every element e 
of domain Dora(a) is characterized by a function defined as : : {ha} u Re/base > [0, l] The set {na} 
U Refbase is the universe of attribute a, we note it ref(a). Example : Let Dora(height) be the domain 
of the height of person. It is defined as : {(ha, 7)} U[0,220cm] × {rl, about, more than, less than} 
U{tall, small} x {r/, very, enough} U{medium} x {r/, very} In the next, {(na, r/)} will omit in the 
domain extension. 1.3 Fuzzy Thesaurus Two persons can use two different words to qualify a same phenomenon, 
but these words can be semantically close or not distinct. For instance, the two concepts white and whitish 
are closed but not identical. So we use the notion of thesaurus to express links be- tween terms. A degree 
can be associated with these links to show the strength of links. Then, this thesaurus is called a fuzzy 
thesaurus. A fuzzy thesaurus is a set (T, R, L, I) where T is a set of terms {tl,... ,tn}, R is a set 
of relations {rl,..., rm}, I is a set of degrees in [0, 1] and L is subset of T × R x T x I of links 
{11,..., l v} where lk = (ti, rq, tj, a) noted : lk : ti -[2+a tj where ti,tj E T, rq E R and ~ E I 
used to express the strength of link lk. For example, we can have a thesaurus of colors containing the 
following links among other links : white cl°se)t°0. 9 whitish whitish clot°0.9 cream When a fuzzy term 
as white is used by the user, then we search the fuzzy terms semantically close to it. To do that, we 
use a grammar indicating the paths to take to reach the semnatically closed terms. In the above ex- ample, 
we can find the terms whitish and cream with an appropriate grammar. Obviously, these terms have not 
the same meaning, then a kind of degree of possibility is calculated for each of these terms. This degree 
is com- puted using the strength of each link and a set of functions associated to each relation. We 
can see the result as the fuzzy set of the used term white. We obtain, for example : Pwhit~ = 1~white 
+ 0.9~whitish + 0.8/crearn where 1, 0.9 and 0.8 are the membership degree of term white, whitish, cream 
to fuzzy set white. Consequently, fuzzy thesaurus is considered as a par- ticular nuanced domain where 
each term is viewed as a vague value (in fact, there exists several strategies con-sisting to consider 
a term as crisp or vague vMue exposed in [7]). 1.4 Fuzzy Object An object I in the database is described 
by a set of quadruples : I = {< a, nv, rel, agg >} where a is an attribute, nv is a nuanced value, tel 
is a relevant degree in [0, 1] showing the relevant of the attribute with regard the others, agg is a 
set of valued attributes in Agg(a) as I.  2 THE SYSTEM FIRMS 2.1 Modelling Process of an Application 
The set of objects forms an application. So, to describe these objects, it is necessary to define the 
common char- acteristics of them. By characteristic, we mean attributes, nuanced values, nuanced domain, 
links between allributes. The process allowing the determination of these charac- teristics is divided 
in three phases : phase I : identification of attributes and values This phase can appear being obvious, 
but it is es- sential and must allow to determinate attributes and values. Sometimes, it is difficult 
to know if an el-ement is an attribute or a value. Then, an expert must separate attributes and values. 
For instance, she (he) can group several attributes in a set of val- ues for another attribute. phase 
II : nuanced domains definitions In this phase, it is necessary to define nuanced do- mains and fuzzy 
terms used on these. An expert of the application field must give the membership func- tion of each term 
(i.e. its meaning). phase III : definition of links between attributes An expert determinates the eventualy 
calculus rules associated to each attributes in the case of its value can be calculated. To allow more 
flexibility in the use of the system, we add a revision phase. In this phase, we can add or modify attributes, 
nuanced domains or links between attributes after the description of some objects. Consequently, the 
process can be abstract by the figure 5. attributes and values identifications nuanced domains definitions 
definitions of links v between attributes  objects description I Figure 5: Modelling process of an application 
 2.2 Research Process The aim of research process is to find a list of objects from database which are 
according to an user need. The need is expressed by an particular object named research profile. A research 
profile is described by the same way of object in database, i.e. by a list of attributes associated to 
nuanced values. The search process do a matching of the profile (the user need or query) with each object 
of database and produce an ordered list of satisfying ob- jects. To order objects, the process uses possibility 
and necessity measures from possibility theory [2] presented in [8]. 3 APPLICATIONS  3.1 Panel of Firms 
Component of an european research system, the panel of Lorraine PME-PMI (Lorraine is a kind of state 
in France and PME-PMI designates firms under 500 employees) is a very important piece of a program developed 
by Institut Commercial de Nancy (commercial institute of Nancy) and the Conseil Rdgional de Lorraine. 
This panel must allow to know the management method of firms more precisely. It groups data on more 400 
firms from 1989 to 1993. Each firms is defined by 700 variables about the following subjects : product, 
ri- valry, export, human resources, strong and weak points, innovation, national assistance, ... Among 
these themes, we have selected those which present some interest for the representation of vague and/or 
uncertain information : strong and weak points, export, human resources and performance. We use the system 
FIRMS essentialy for two reasons. Firstly, the system allows a reality representation more reliable with 
the inherent vagueness and uncertainty. Sec- ondly, the system allows rapidly and simply verification 
of hypothesis by the use of profiles. 3.2 Expert System The Institut Commercial de Nancy has developed 
an ex- pert system in 1989 to formulate dignosis about the state- ment and the development of a firm. 
This analysis uses dynamic contextual factors which continually have an in- fluence on firms framework. 
But the expert, using a set of simple rules, was not efficient because it cannot handle vagueness. For 
instance, it cannot take into account the following rules determined by an human expert to qualify an 
emergent firm. ~production cost = high) and (customs expe- rience = low) and (existence of infrastructure 
= low) and (strategic uncertainty = high) then emergent firm I FIRMS has been used to solve the problem 
of vague- ness and uncertainty. A firm is described by a list of at- tributes : production cost, customs 
experience, existence of infrastructure, strategic uncertainty, technological re- sources, technological 
uncertainty, .... All attributes has the same nuanced domain : [0, 20] × {abo t, U{ Low, Average, Important, 
High} × {7;} O{LA, AI, IH} × {rl} where LA, AI and IH mean LowAverage, Averagelmpor- tant and ImportantHigh. 
Consequently, we can use a numeric value to designate the attribute value when it is possible to quantify 
it. Else, we can use a fuzzy term as Low, High for example. Each simply rules used in the diagnosis is 
transformed by a profile. For instance, the profile of an emergent firm is the following : Profile name 
: Emergent firm production cost = High customs experience = Low existence of infrastructure = Low strategic 
uncertainty = High Then, to do a diagnosis is the same to do a chaining of research profiles. We have 
five profiles for the firm type and for each type we have three or four recommendation profiles. The 
set of profiles is presented in figure 6. Object in database Emergent firm i ~ technologic development

Process 3.3 Potential Applications There are numerous potential applications, for instance : management 
of human resources : to find the best candidate according to a profile in a Curriculum Vi- tae database 
 Marketing : to research potential customers accord- ing to a commercial objective in a prospect database 
 economic and financial field : to research, in a firms database, those according to a given profile 
   CONCLUSION FIRMS is a flexible system allowing the handling of vagueness and uncertainty. Among 
the basic concepts, two are very important. The first is the concept of aggre- gate attribute. It allows 
an user to describe two objects with different precision levels. The second is the con-cept of fuzzy 
thesaurus. It determinates a set of weighted linked terms and uses a grammar to go through it con-trary 
to other approaches [4][5]. An iterative and incre- mental process allows to describe the basic elements 
of an application. The experiences with real data in economic fields has shown the flexibility of FIRMS.
