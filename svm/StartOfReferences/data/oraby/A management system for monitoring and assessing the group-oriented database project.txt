 A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING AND ASSESSING THE GROUP-ORIENTED DATABASE PROJECT by D. V. PiEford 
 Department of Computer Science Western Illinois University Macomb, IL 61~55 309-298-Ia52 This paper 
presents the evaluation techniques and forms for implementlnE stoup-oriented database projects in a 
senior level database course. A manaEement system for monitorlnE the deslEn, implementation, and testlnE 
of a small production database application uslnE the team approach serves as the focus of this paper. 
Emphasis is upon both time and efficiency for students and instructor. The database prototype is implemented 
in phase one with a relational mlcrocomputer tool and in phase two with a relational mainframe DBMS. 
 Key words: Database, Stoup project, evaluation, assessment  I. OVERVIEW  ImplementinE a database class 
with practical applications necessitates a hiEh overhead of student/professor time. expertise, and knowledEe 
of available implementation tools. ConveylnE to students in one semester the basics concepts of database 
systems is a feat in itself much less leadlnz underEraduates th~ouEh the details of a small database 
implementation. MonltorinE, pacinE, and evaluatinE this process tames careful plannlnE and efficient 
use of time [PiEford82]. At Western Illinois University. senior database classes are exposed to the 
fundamentals of database manaEemen~ systems in parallel with the implementation of a menu-drlven database 
application. Students are orEanlzed into teams of four and design, test, ~r~A implement their system

of this approach rests in basic assumptions about the purpose of implementation with available in-house

the purpose of Phase I is to desirn and implement a small DBMS usinE a microcomputer tool within the 
first half of the semester (eIEh% weeks). This task is in parallel with the basle theory and bacMEround 
presented in the standard database course. The two phase project accounts for 350 points out of 1.000 
points or 35~ of the Erade. The score earned by the team is the score assiEned to each individual ream 
member. A typical team project involves a minimum of four files, one-hundred realistic data records, 
and a user-oriented menu for addlnE, deletinE0 updatinE, and queryinK. The first task is the assiEnment 
of team members. Teams can develop as a default by student choice or from the instructor. This task. 
unfortunately, must be done within the first week of the semester. SelectinE a purpose or system to implement 
is next. The next sequential step for each team is determininE the PROJECT PLAN. This form is a vehicle 
for determlnlnE within the KrouD of four team members "who is responsible for whet" (See 1986 9/18 9/25

AfteP the opal pPesentation of the softwaPe prototype, a class period is devoted to a team's testinE 
a database project that they did not implement. This activity is done in the computeP science laboPatory 
with fouP People worMinE to a terminal. At the end of the lab pePlod (or by 5:00 pm) each team must post 
anothem delivePable, DATABASE TESTING (Flture 6), on the bulletin boaPd. Emphasis is placed on deteotinE 
erPoPs, assesslnE the user intePface, and suEgestlons for impmovement. Needless to say, thls is one activity 
that senioP computer science students seems to enjoy! Thus, PHASE I ends with the mlcrocomputeP application, 
a llst of peep SUEEestions for improvement, and both obvious and hidden differences within team membePships. 
 IV. PHASE II: MAINFRAME DATEBASE PRO3ECT EXTENSION After a recovery from mldterm examinations and 
projects, the students, in their same teem assiEnment, attempt to implement their readjusted database 
 application wlth a mainframe relational tool (INGRES). The team members proceed hrouEh the usual flow 
Of dellverables to the pPofessoP. Since the in-class instruction has now covered more bacR-Eround in

are extensive.  Vl. CONCLUSION The thrust of this paper is the manaEement system for monitorinE, pacinE, 
and evaluatinE database application projects with both a relational microcomputer tool and a mainframe 
DBMS. In order to effect this strateEy, a series of sequential steps are initiated in both phases. These 
tasks include: Project Plan PERT Chart Team Conference with Instructor Dellverables Oral Presentation 
of Database Prototype Written Documentation of the Database Prototype Database testinE via a Different 
Team Evaluation  The entire sequence, in abbreviated and modified form, is repeated with a relational 
mainframe DBMS tool. The major difference between the two major implementations is the prior knowledEe 
of the participants, the sophistication of the evaluation tool. and the inherent technicalities of the 
chosen DBMS. Varla-tions and suEEestions are offered for improving this manaEement plan and for adoptlnE 
the procedure to different environments. Any additional recommenda-tions for improvinE productivity and 
pro-motinE efficiency in the database environ-ment are Ereatly appreciated. REFERENCES  <RefA>[AireS0] Atre.
