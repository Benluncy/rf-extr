 O805 ABSTRACT A computer program is described which has been developed for obtaining approximate 
solutions to linear initial and boundary value problems involving differential equations. The program 
can be used for ordinary curve fitting as well. For each problem, input to the program includes: I. 
The equations (in symbolic form) to be satisfied -the differential equations, equations describing auxiliary 
conditions such as boundary conditions, etc. 2. A numerical description of the regions in which each 
of the equations are to be satisfied.  3. Sets of functions (in symbolic form) to be used in linear 
combinations to approximate the solution functions.  Given the above input, the program generates an 
approximation to the solutuon of the specified problem in terms of the specified functions which is optimum 
in the least squares sense. A number of examples illustrating the use of the program are included in 
the paper. iv 0806 Administrative Information This work was sponsored by the David Taylor Model Basin

We set up a project a few years ago at the David Taylor Model Basin for the purpose of exploiting the 
combined capabilities of digital computers for carrying out extensive calculations and for manipulating 
mathematical operators in symbolic form. The problem area chosen was that of obtaining solutions of boundary 
and initial value problems, especially those arising in mathematical physics. Two general approaches 
to the solution of such problems are: (a) The determination of fixed points of operators by means of 
iterative techniques. (b) The determination of a set of parameters which will minimize in some sense 
the difference between the desired solution and an approximating function. The approximating function 
will involve parameters and independent variables. Collocation methods, difference methods, methods based 
on Taylor series expansion, Galerkins method, and may others can be viewed as methods of this type. A 
good general reference in this area is furnished by Collatz's book ~1 ~.  To date we have been concerned 
with developing some general purpose routines for applying the second of the above techniques to linear 
problems. Here, by "general purpose" routines we mean routines which permit the needed equations to be 
stated symbolically as part of the input (differential equations, equations required to describe aux-iliary 
conditions, etc. ), together with a description of the regions in 0808 which they are to be applied. 
The symbolic form of the approximating function is also to be part of the input. Then an approximating 
solution function is generated, which is optimum in some sense. An exciting FORMAC routine has been developed 
to do just this for linear prob- lems. We have called it BVPDE3. BVPDE3 has proved to be a useful tool 
for curve fitting as well as for approximating solutions of problems involving differential equations. 
It is the purpose of this paper to describe this routine and illustrate some of its applications. 2. 
Background: A number of general purpose routines have been developed for solving linear boundary value 
problems involving two-dimensional, self-adJoint elliptic partial differential equations using finite 
difference methods. One of the earliest was the SPADE system (developed by a committee of SHARE) for 
the IBM 704. A more recent and very interesting program of this type was described by Engeli and Lauchli 
at the 1962 International Federation of Information Processing Congress F2~. Programs for solving problems 
involving differential equations and using techniques somewhat similar to those being considered here 
include ones which have been described by P. Davis and P. Rabinowitz r_3J, S. Bergmann and J. Herriot 
F4], M. Lieberstein F_5], J. Schroeder ~6], and J. D. Young [7]. When our project was set up a few years 
ago, out first need was for a set of assembly language subroutines for use with FORTRAN generated object 
programs which would permit us to present mathematical 3 0809 functions and differential equations in 
symbolic form, as input to object programs, permit the differentiation of the operators appearing, permit 
the substitutbn of one expression for another, all in symbolic form, and finallY, permit the evaluation 
of the resulting expressions for specified values of the independent variables and parameters. We found 
no routines in the published literature for the computers we had at hand which would meet our needs, 
so we started work on a subroutine package. At the August, 1964 meeting of the Association for Computing 
Machinery we heard about FORMAC E 8] and were very pleased when its release as an experimental program 
was announced by IBM. FORMAC has furnished us with an excellent tool for the development of experimental 
programs. 3. Approach. Problems of the type we are considering can be expressed in the form Tv -g=0 where 
v is an element of a linear space R, T is an operator defined in a domain F of R and maps F uniquely 
into the space R, and g is a specified element of R. We are interested in obtaining functions w which 
approximate v, together with estimates of the difference w -v. The approach we are taking is to assume 
that the required 4 0810 solution can be approximated by a function w of a set of parameters a~, ..., 
a so that some norm of the difference of Tv and Tw Xa09 P designated by [Tv -Tw [ is minimized i.e. so 
that w satisfies the operator equation as well as possible in some sense. In this way, problems involving 
the solution of differential equations can be replaced by problems involving the solution of systems 
of algebraic equations or inequalities. To be somewhat more specific, let us consider the following problem: 
Determine a function v(x) of n independent variables x 1, (designated collectively by x) which satisfies 
an equation x 2, .., x n of the form v bv b2v a2v F(x, v, ' "'" ~x ' ~x 2, ~x ~x '"" ) =0 aXl n 1 1 2 
-,V in some region B of the x -space and which also satisfies m boundary conditions of the form F v, 
av av a2v2 a2v = ~x 1 ,... , , ~XlaX2 , .. ) 0 , ~x n ~x 1 on a set of (n -1) dimensional surfaces r 
~= 1, 2, . , m of the -~.~9 "" x -space. Assume that the problem is well-posed, i.e. that a solution 
exists, is unique, and depends continuously on the given data. Then, given a function w (x; a) depending 
on the independent variables Xl, x2, ..., x and a set of parameters al, a2, ..., a (designated coli- 
n p ectively by a) we seek particular values of these parameters so that 08/I 5 in some sense w(x; 
a) approximates the solution function v(x) as well as possible. In terms of the error function ~w ~w 
~2w ~2w F (x, w, ~' ""' ~Xn ' ~X-~l ' ~Xl~X2' ''') -" (x, = ~or x~ B F (x, w, ~w ~x 1, ..., 5w 5x n , 
52w 52w ~Xl~ .--, ~Xl~X2, ...) for ~ ~ r ~t we wish to determine a to minimize some norm of ~'(x, a), 
i.e. .=4 so that in some sense ~ (x, a) approximates the zero function as well as possible. The use 
of various norms for £ (x, a) corresponds to the use of various error distribution principles El, p28]. 
For our present purposes we chose a least squares norm since this is a simple one to apply and routines 
were readily available for obtaining least squares fits. Another interesting possibility is the choice 
of a minimax or Chebyshev norm. In this case one is led to the solution of a mathematical programming 
problem, which in the linear case reduces to a linear programming problem  (see [9] and [7]). We are 
restricting our attention to well-posed linear problems, for the present. Such problems can be written 
in the form L i(V;x) = gi (~) i=1, ..., M (1) where the operators L i now are linear operators, i.e., 
the L i (V; x)  OS~, 6 are linear in the unknown function V and the partial derivatives of V --t with 
respect to the independent variables x. The functions gi' t = 1, . .., M depend on the independent variables 
x, only. For -.4 each of the above equations, x is assumed to be in the appropriate region which will 
be designated by F i for the i th equation. Since we are minimizing with respect to a least squares norm, 
we seek to determine a so as to minimize M Z fi (Li (w (x, a); x) -gi (~))2 Wi (x) dx (2) i-1 where the 
W i are appropriately chosen weight functions and w(x, a) is the approximating function. Since we are 
working with linear operators, we will assume w(x, a)= ~ aj fj (x) (3) j=l where the fj (x) are appropriately 
chosen functions for the type of approximation being attempted. Then, since the L i are linear operators 
L i (w(~, ~); x) = aj L i (f] (~); ~) (4) j--1 --t for each x in the required regions. The expression 
(2) which we seek to 7 0813 minimize can be now written aj 5 i (fj (~); ~) -gi (~) 2 Wi (~) dx (5) = 
1 The present version of BVPDE 3 requires that the Fibe specified numerically. Thus the integral in (5) 
is replaced by a sum, and (5) is rewritten i=1 1 j=l Note that the weights Wi(x k) here should take account 
of the area to be associated with the point Xk" They will not be,in general, values of the weight function 
of (5), but will take that weight function into account. We define L i and gi to be zero unless the i 
th equation is to be satisfied for x = x k. Symbolic input to BVPDE 3 includes the operators L i (V; 
x), the functions fj (x), gi (x) and W i (x) in the form required for (6). Alternate input options permit 
any of the functions gi(x) and W i (x) to be specified numerically, in particular gi (Xk) and W i (x 
k) can be specified numerically for any desired subsets of the ~k" BVPDE 3 then generates Li in symbolic 
form, evaluates hi (fJ (Xk); Xk )' gi (xk)' and W i (Xk) and carries through the determination of the 
set of parameters a i which minimize (6). The method used by BVPDE 3 is a very general one. When the 
equations 8 0814 are of the form V = gi (~) the error in using the approximating function in place of 
the given functions gi (~) in the regions of interest is readily bounded by noting the maximum difference 
between gi (x) and the approximating functions aj L i ~); 5) -fj (x) a s =1 jffil in the regions r i. 
In the more general case where any of the L i are differential operators. the error in the approximation 
obtained for V is not so readily assessed. The residual functions given by D Li(~ a s fj (x);x)" gi 
(~) j=l are readily obtained, but one must infer from this some bound on v a s fj (x) j=1 where V (x) 
is the theoretical solution to the problem. A survey of a number of techniques for doing this is given 
by Davis and Rabinowitz r3, pg. 751. When the problem is of monotone type, i.e. when L i (V; ~) - gl 
(~) >" Li (V; x) - gi (x) implies v ~) ~ u (~) for each ~ in the appropriate regions, and U and V are 
any two appropriate functions (with continuous partial derivatives of as high an order as is required), 
then we can obtain error bounds by determining two sets of    OS1S 9 parameters ai(1) and ai(2) so 
that (1) Li (fj (~); ~). gi ~) ] s0 I aj (2) L i (fj (5);x)-gi (~) ] ¢0J=l for appropriate values of 
~. In this case, we know that J=l j fJ ~) ~ V~) ~ aj (2) fj (~) Many problems of physical interest 
can be posed as problems of monotone type. See rl], F6], and F.11] for some discussion of this approach. 
We shall use it to obtain error estimates for some of the sample problems giver later in this paper. 
4. Description of BVPDE 3 BVPDE 3 is a FORMAC program F10~. At present it is being run under the IBSYS 
Version 13 Monitor system on the IBM 7090. The program is a relatively simple one, and yet it can be 
used to obtain approximate solutions in a variety of forms to many problems of real interest to us. As 
already indicated, BVPDE 3 can be used to solve linear boundary, and also initial value problems involving 
ordinary and partial differential equations. The right hand side of any of the equations can be supplied 
numerically, so that the program has curve fitting capabilities as well. The fitting functions are specified 
as part of the input and may be analytic functions or functions such as spline functions, which are locally 
analytic with conditions to be satisfied at patch points. Examples showing a variety of applications 
of BVPDE 3 are presented in the last section of thts paper. 10 0S16 Specifically BVPDE 3 has as input: 
a) Sets of linear (partial or ordinary) differential equations in symbolic form, together with auxiliary 
conditions (usually boundary conditions), also in symbolic form b) Sets of functions in symbolic form, 
linear combinations of which are to be used in approximating solutions c) Sets of points (and weights) 
at which specified functions are to be determined which minimize the residuals in a least squares sense, 
when substituted into the specified equation. In particular, the differential equations and auxiliary 
conditions are given as FORMAC expressions rl0J. They must be linear in the dependent variable V and 
in its derivatives with respect to the independent variables. There may be up to 3 independent variables: 
X, Y, and Z. Only the equations to be satisfied need be specified. For example, suppose a solution to 
Laplace's equation which satisfies certain boundary conditions is sought. Suppose also, that harmonic 
polynomials are to be used for the approximating functions. Then, since Lapiace's equation is automatically 
satisfied by linear combinations of harmonic polynomials, that equation need not be specified as part 
of the input. Only the equations to be satisfied on the boundary need be given. The functions fj to be 
used in linear combination to approximate the solution are specified as FORMAC expressions in X, Y, and 
Z. In the present compilation, up to 20 such functions can be used. Sets of points with weights are used 
to specify the domains in which the various given equations are to be satisfied. A total of 80 points 
is 11 0817  permitted with the present compilation. Not all functions need be used with each point set. 
Thus, in addition to analytic functions, functions which are not analytic may be used in the fitting. 
This gives BVPDE 3 considerable flexibility. The method used by BVPDE 3 is straight forward. It was described 
in the preceding section. Parameters al, a2, ..., ap are sought to minimize (6). It should be remembered 
that only selected functions and equations are used at each point. Thus we must interpret fj and L i 
in (6) as follows: fj* (Xk) for selected ~k as specified in input data I0 otherwise where fj* is the 
jth input function, and --4 Li* (fj (Xk); Xk ) if i th equation is to be satisfied at ~k 0 otherwise 
where L i (V; x) is specified in the i th input equation. Also gi --'(Xk ) and  W i ~k ) are interpreted 
similarly. The subroutine ORTH used to obtain the least squares fit,uses an orthogonalization technique 
based on the Gram -Schmidt orthogonalization process ~3]. Table I contains a description of the set-up 
of the input data cards for BVPDE 3. A sequence of problems can be run by stacking the appro- priate 
input cards. The last data card is followed by an IBSYS End of File Card with rows 7 and 8 of column 
I punched. Figure I contains a listing of the BVPDE 3 routine followed by the data used for the sample

supplied as a FORMAC expression. 14 0820 5. Sample Problems. To illustrate the use and some of the flexlbtltttes 
of BVPDE3, a number of sample problems are presented. The input cards for these problems, exactly as 
they were used, are listed at the end of the program deck in Figure 1. The first problem illustrates 
a use of BVPDE3 for solving a boundary value problem involving a partial differential equation. In particular, 
the distortion of a rectangular membrane by a specified pressure distribution is calculated. The problem 
can be posed as one involving the solution of Laplace's equation with specified conditions on the boundary 
of the rectangle (see Eli, p. 41'/). An approximate solution is obtained in terms of harmonic polynomials 
with appropriate symmetries. Applying the boundary maximum principle, we infer error bounds on our solution. 
The next two problems involve the use of BVPDE3 in solving two boundary value problems involving ordinary 
differential equations. The first involves a second order equation, the second involves a fourth order 
equation. These equations are discussed by Schroeder (see ~6], pp. 45, 50). In this case, approximating 
functions which satisfy the boundary conditions are used. Then, after noting that the problems are monotonic, 
bounds can be obtained on the approxi- mate solutions. For this purpose another DTMB FORMAC routine CMPFN3 
can be used. This very useful routine can have as input a function involving an independent variable 
and parameters. Partial derivatives with respect to each of the parameters are  is 0821 generated and 
printed in symbolic form. The function and scaled derivatives with respect to each of the parameters 
are tabulated and plotted. Thus the sensitivity of many functions with respect to perturbations in parameter 
values can be readily assessed. The next four problems illustrate a number of ways of obtaining approximations 
to e -X . The first uses BVPDE 3 to generate a few terms of its Taylor series expansion about the origin 
by requiring that the differential equation and a certain number of its derivatives be satisfied for 
x = 0 along with the initial condition at x = J. The second approximation is obtained by trying to satisfy 
the differential equation at a number of points for x on the interval r0, 1J along with the appropriate 
initial condition. A polynomial is still used for the approximating function. The third problem combines 
the first two approaches by determining a polynomial which nearly matches several derivatives of e "x 
at two points. The fourth problem performs a least squares fit of e "x directly. The last four problems 
illustrate the fitting of x In x on r0, 1~ in various ways. The first uses a function of the form 5 Z 
k=l Ak x I/k and fits x In x directly. The second obtains an approximation by trying to satisfy a differential 
equation and an initial condition for x In x. The other two problems illustrate the use of BVPDE 3 for 
obtaining piecewise analytic approximations to x In x. The first problem uses an approximating function 
which has no constraints at patch points. 16 0S22 The second problem uses a function which is locally 
of the form a0 xl/2 + a I + a2x + a3x2. The function is put together so that the function and its first 
derivative are continuous at each of the patch points. After this quick survey of our sample problems, 
let us look more carefully at the results obtained in each case. 17 0823 For Test Problem I, the complete 
output is shown in Figure 2. As already noted, we are seeking the transverse displacement of a rec- 
tangular membrane due to a specific transverse loading function. In particular, we seek u such that 
the equation: (8) V 2u=x 2-1 forlxj<l, [YI<.5 and the.boundary conditions: u=0 for Ixl =I whenlyl~.5 
and u=0 forjy[ =.5 when Ix[~l  are satisfied. If we let 4 2 X X V=u'T~ +-~  Then (8) becomes ~7 2 
V= V2u-x2+l =0 for Jx I ~ 1, [Yl ~ 5 with the corresponding boundary conditions 5 for Ix] =1, lY] ~_'5 
12(9) V = 4 2 X X "'T'2"~ 2--for [y] =.5, ixi <_1  We are using harmonic polynomials with the appropriate 
~ymmetries as the approximating functions. Since the harmonic polynomials automatically satisfy Laplace's 
equation, the only additional equations to be satisfied are those specifying the boundary conditions 
(9). Thus, the input equations for the first problem are exactly these. The output generated consists 
18 OS~.d~ first of the equations and functions exactly as they were input and then as they were converted 
by FORMAC. The input functions are Just the first five harmonic polynomials with appropriate symmetries. 
Each expression is terminated by a '~" symbol. Points at which the various equations are to be applied 
along with the set of functions, weights, and values of right hand sides of the equations are then tabulated. 
Note that in view of the symmetry of the problem with respect to the two coordinate axes, only boundary 
points in the first quadrant need be given. For Ix[ = I, values of y = 0(. 1). 5 are given, while for 
[y[ =. 5, values of [xl = 0(. 1)I are given. When the least squares fR is made, an orthogonalizing process 
is used, so that the coefficients for a sequence of optimum fits are generated using Just the first function, 
then the first two functions, etc. These coefficients are given as part of the output. They are labelled 
A(1), then A(1), A(2), etc. The quantity labelled SD is the standard deviation of the residuals when 
the set of coefficients on the line following are used. Thus, one can see the improvement made as each 
function in sequence is added to the set of functions being used in linear combination for the approximation. 
For each point the right hand side is tabulated next to that calculated using the best approximating 
function obtained. The last column contains the difference, i.e. the residual function. Note that in 
view of the boundary maximum principle, we know that the maximum error will be attained on the boundary. 
 082.5 19  -5 The solution generated is in error by less than 2 x I0 . The second problem is a boundary 
value problem involving a second order ordinary differential equation: dV 2 d2V + 2x--~..-. +(l-x2) V=l-x 
dx 2 for 0 <~ x <~ 1 with boundary conditions: m dV dx (0)= V(1) =0 In this case we seek an approximate 
solution of the form I0 w(x, a)= ~--I ak(l"k+l)  Note that w (x, a) satisfies the boundary conditions 
so that only the differential equations need be taken account of in determining a. The set of points 
used for the fit were x = 0(. 05). 95. The results obtained are shown in Figure 3. Note that with the 
number of sig- nlficant figures carried, when only the first six functions are used, the standard error 
of the residuals is already down to I. 73 x 10-5; the maximum residual is less than 2 x I0 "4. The exact 
solution in this case is V=l-e I/2 (x2" I) The error in the approximate solution generated is less than 
5 x 10 "6. 0826 20 The third problem involves a fourth order ordinary differential equation: d4V + (I 
+x(l -x)) V=IO00 (I +x)  for 0 ~x~ 1 subject to boundary conditions dV(O) = V(1)= dV(1) =0 V(O) = dx 
'dx'  An approximating function of the form 8 W(x, a)= ~ akx2(1-x) 2x k" 1 k=l  was used. The points 
used in the least squares fit were x=. 05(. 05). 95. The results obtained are shown in Figure 4. This 
problem, as formulated, is again of monotone type. See F6]. By calculating the perturbation in the residual 
function when each of the parameters is changed, we find that non-negative and non-positive residuals 
can be guaranteed by increasing or decreasing a 1 by .0004. Corresponding to these changes in al, the 
approximating function will change by at most. 00003. Thus, an error bound for the approximation generated 
is Iv -wl 00003 where again, 7 is the exact solution and w the approximating function. Thus we have, 
for example, V (. 5) = 3.89657 + . 00003   OSZ7 21 Sample problems 4 to 6A illustrate a number of 
ways of approximating e -X using BVPDE3. Problem 4 uses BVPDE3 to generate the first six terms of the 
Taylor series expansion of V = e -x about the origin by requiring that V=I atx=0 and that dn 0 dx n

in Figure 5. Figure 5A contains a plot of the difference + I x 2 x 3  ~-e-X.~.~ ~ .~ ~x' ~x~, Problem

the error. Problem 6A gives an approximation of e "x directly in the least squares sense for x = 0(.

a number of ways in which x In x might be fit using BVPDE3. When we approximate x In x by a function

problem 8 also gives an approximation to x In x by a function of the form (10) on the intervalO, 1). 
In this case, however, the a k are determined so as to minimize = lnx + 1 -dx in the least squares sense 
for x =. 05 and x =. 1(. 1)I. The condition that V = 0 at x = 1 is also included. The output obtained 
is shown in Figure 10. The error curve is plotted in Figure 10A. In the next problem x In x is approximated 
by a 0x 1"2/ +alx+a2x2 for0~_x~_.2 2 a 3 + a4x + a5x for . 2 ~ x ~ . 6 2 a 6 + aTx +a8x for. 6 ~_ x 
~_ 1.  The actual points used in the least squares fR were x =. 05(. 05). 2(. 1)1. The function generated 
is shown in Figure 11. A plot of the error curve is also given. In the final problem x In x is approximated 
by a function of the form a0xl/2+al x +a2 x2 where 0 otherwise Note that this function has patch points 
at x=. 2, . 4, . 6, and. 8 at which the function and its first derivative are continuous. The points 
used for this fit were x =. 05(. 05). 2(. 1)1. The function generated is shown in Figure 12. The error 
curve is also plotted. 0830 24 Figure 1. Listing of BVPDE3 Instruction Deck with Test Data $1BSYS $ATTACH
