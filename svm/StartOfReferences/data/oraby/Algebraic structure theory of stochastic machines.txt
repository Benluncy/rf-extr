 ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE THEORY OF STOCHASTIC MACHINES* EUGENE S. SANTOS Department of Mathematics, Youngstown 
State University Youngstown, Ohio I. Introduction Despite the advances of the algebraic structure theory 
of deterministic machines [5] and the recent wide-spread interest in stochastic machines [3], the problem 
regarding the algebraic structure of stochastic machines has not attrac- ted much attention. The first 
and only systematic work in this area is due to Bacon [i], who developed an elegant but somewhat restricted 
decomposition theory of stochastic machines. In the present paper, an algebraic structure theory of 
stochastic machines is developed which contains both Bacon's theory [i] and Hartmanis' theory for deterministic 
machines [5] as special cases. Although the present theory is patterned after both theories, it exhibits 
many interesting features which are here-to-fore unknown. Among other things, it is shown that the basic 
concepts involved, e.g., partitions with substitution property, partition pairs, state- behavior realizations, 
are all equivalent to well-known concepts in linear alge- bra. This observation enables one to determine 
the component machines in a decomposition by solving certain simple matrix equations, instead of the 
compli- cated constructions required by Bacon's and Hartmanis' theories. Moreover, it is shown that the 
"don't care" condition often encountered in Hartmanis' theory is a consequence of the fact that the solution 
of a matrix equation need not be unique. The main contents of the present paper is contained in Sections 
II to IV. Section II introduces the model of stochastic machines to be used in subsequent developments. 
In order to provide more insights to the problems involved, quasi stochastic sequential machines (QSM) 
are used. They are obtained by relaxing the positiveness condition of stochastic machines. Moreover, 
the model of QSM used in the present paper differs from the conventional model [3,9] in that the transition 
"probabilities" of the QSM considered in this paper may depend on the present output. However, it is 
easily seen that any such QSM may be "converted" to a conventional QSM. In Section III, various types 
of realizations and assignments are intro- duced. Properties of these realizations and assignments are 
also examined. It is shown that the only type of realization considered by Bacon [i] corresponds to the 
simplest type of realization discussed in the present paper. The concepts of partitions with substitution 
property, partition pairs, etc. are introduced in Section III. However, instead of considering partitions 
of the states of a stochastic machine, partitions of the state-output distribu- tions of a stochastic 
machine are considered. This leads to many fruitful results. Incidentally, a generalization of the concept 
of "lumpable" matrix [6] is given in this section. The last section gives a formulation of a network 
of concurrently opera- ting QSMs. The concept of loop-free network is also defined. Necessary and sufficient 
conditions for a given QSM to be realizable by a network, arbitrary or loop-free, are given. II. Basic 
Concepts and Notation Definition. A quasi stochastic sequential machine (QSM) may be specified through 
a quadruple M = (uM,sM,vM,p M) where U M, S M and V M are finite non- *Works reported herein are supported 
in part by the University Research Council of Youngstown State University. -219- empty sets, and pM 
is a real valued function with domain (S M x V M) × U M x (S M × V M) satisfying the condition: C ~ pM(s''v'lu's'v) 
= 1 for all u e U M F s e S M and v e V M v'eV M s ~eJ M If the range of pM is a subset of the closed 
unit interval [0,i], then M is a stochastic sequential machine (SSM) or a 2-QSM. If the range of pM con- 
sists of at most the two numbers 0 and i, then M is a deterministic se- quential machine (DSM) or a 3-QSM. 
For convenience sake, an arbitrary QSM will also be referred to as a i-QSM. in the above definition, 
U M and V M are respectively, the input and out- put sets, and S M is the state set of M. For SSM, pM(s',v'lu,s,v) 
is the conditional probability that the next state of M is s' and the output is v' given that the present 
state of M is s, the present output is v, and input u is applied. The function pM is called the transition 
function of M. Observe that if pM does not depend on the present output of M, then the above definition 
of QSM reduces to the conventional one [3,9]. Mathemati- cally speaking, the above model of QSM contains 
the conventional model of QSM as special case. However, it is readily seen that every QSM defined above 
can be "converted" into a conventional QSM. In what follows, the symbol M, with or without subscripts, 
will always represent a QSM. Notation. (i) D ~4 is the collection of all nonempty finite sequences of 
elements of U M. (2) Let ~ e ~M. Ig(~) will denote the length of ~.  (3) ~M is a real valued function 
with domain (S M x V M) x U M × (S M x V M) such that for every s',s" e S M, v',v" e S M, u e U M and 
~ e ~M,  (i) ~M(s",v"lu,s',v') = pM(s",v"lu,s',v'),  (ii) ~M(s",v"lu~,s',v')= ~ ~ ~(s",v"I~,s,v)pM(s,vlu,s',v'). 
veVM sesM  (4) qM is a real valued function with domain vMxu~×(sMxv M) such that for every s e S M, 
v,v' e U M, and ~ e U ~,  qM(v l ,s,v) = S 'eS It can be verified that both ~M and qM are independent 
of the present output if pM is independent of the present output. For SSM, ~M(s',v'IU, s,v) is the probability 
that the next state of M is s' and the last output is v' given that the present state of M is s, the 
present output is v, and the input sequence u is applied; while qM(v'lu,s,v) is the probability that 
the last output of M is v' given that the present state of M is s, the present output is v, and the input 
sequence ~ is applied. In order to use matrices to characterize and denote the various concepts introduced 
in the present paper, all the sets considered are assumed to be well-ordered. Notation. For every ~ 
e U ~, --M (i) pM(~) is the matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is p (wjl~,w i) where w i is the i-th element 
of sM×vM;  (2) QM(~) is the matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is qM(vjl~,w i) where vj is the j-th element 
of vM; and  (3) E is a column matrix of appropriate order whose entries are all I. Proposition 2.1. 
For every ul,u 2 e ~M,  (a) PM(~i~2) = PM(~i) PM(~2) ; and  (b) QM(~i~2) = pM(~1) QM(u2)-- . Definition. 
Let K be a real matrix.  (i) K is affine or a 1-matrix iff (if and only if) KE = E;  (2) K is stochastic 
or a 2-matrix iff KE = E and all entries of K are nonnegative; and  (3) K is deterministic or a 3-matrix 
iff KE = E and all entries of K are either 0 or i. In what follows, the letter k will stand for i, 2, 
or 3 unless other-  wise stated. Proposition 2.2. M is a k-QSM iff for every u e U M, pM(u) is a k-matrix. 
 Proposition 2.3. If K 1 and K 2 are k-matrices, so is KIK 2. Definition. K is a strict k-matrix iff 
K is a k-matrix and for every affine matrix Ki, KiK is a k-matrix implies KiK = K2K for some k-matrix 
K 2. Proposition 2.4. Let K, K I and K 2 be k-matrices with linearly indepen- dent rows. Then (a) KiK 
2 is a k-matrix; and (b) for every affine matrix K', K'K is a k-matrix implies K' is a k-matrix. Notation. 
K t will denote the transpose of the matrix K. Definition. Let K be a real matrix. A pseudo inverse 
of K is a ma- trix K + such that KK+K = K. A generalized inverse of K is a matrix K* such that KK*K 
= K, K*KK* = K*, (KK*) t = KK* and (K'K) t = K*K. Properties of pseudo and generalized inverses of matrices 
can be found elsewhere [7,8]. It is well-known [7] that the generalized inverse of a matrix always exists 
and is unique. Proposition 2.5. (a) Let k = 1 or 3. K is a strict k-matrix iff K is a k-matrix. (b) 
Let K be a stochastic matrix. K is a strict 2-matrix iff the convex span [4] of the rows of K is the 
intersection of a hyperplane with the unit cube. Definition. M 1 is a (strict) k-submachine of M 2 iff 
U MI ~U M2 and there exists a (strict) k-matrix K with linearly independent rows such that for every 
u e U M , pMi(u)K = KpM2(u). The matrix K will be referred to as the associated matrix. By virtue of 
Proposition 2.5(a), the distinction between strict k-subma- chine and k-submachine disappears when k 
= 1 or 3. Notation. The symbol I will denote an identity matrix with appropriate order. Theorem 2.6. 
If M I is a k-submachine of M 2 with associated matrix K, then for every ~ e U ~ I and pseudo inverse 
K + of K, (a) pM1 (~) = KP M2 (u) K+; (b) KP MI (~) = KP M2 (~)K + K; and (c) PM1(u) K = Kp M2 (~) . 
 M + M + Proof. Let u e U i and K a pseudo inverse of K. Then KP 2(u)K K = PMi(u)KK+K = PMI (u)K = KpM2 
(u). Moreover, since the rows of K are linearly independent, KK + = I. Therefore PMI (u) = PMi (u)KK 
+ = KpM2 (u)K +. The conclu- sions follow from Proposition 2.1(a) and induction. It can be shown that 
if K is a deterministic matrix and has linearly independent rows, K* = K t. Thus, by virtue of the above 
theorem, the concept of 3-submachines reduces to the usual concept of submachines except for renaming 
of states and outputs. Theorem 2.7. If M2 is a k-QSM and Mi is a strict k-submachine of -222- M 2, 
then Mi is a k-QSM. Proof. Let K be the associated matrix and u e uMi. Then P MI (u)K = KpM2 (u). Since 
M2 is a k-QSM, KpM2 (u) is a k-matrix by Propositions 2.2 and M 2.3. Therefore, by Proposition 2.4(b), 
P i (u) is a k-matrix. Thus, Mi is a k-QSM. Theorem 2.8. If Mi is a (strict) k-submachine of M2 and M2 
is a (strict) k-submachine of M3, then M1 is a (strict) k-submachine of M3. Proof. Follows from Propositions 
2.3 and 2.4(a). Definition. A state-output distribution (sod) of M is a real valued function h with 
domain sMxvM such that v~vM se~sM h(s,v) = i. If h is a sod of M, then the same symbol h will be used 
to denote the row matrix whose i-th component is h(w i) where w i is the i-th element of sM×v M. Definition. 
Let h be a sod of M. h is a k-sod of M iff h is a k-matrix. Notation. H k(M) is the collection of all 
k-sod of M. We shall also write H (M) for H I (M) . Definition. For every h e H(M) and ~ e U ~, define 
rM(h,~) = hQM(II). r M is the response function of M. M Definition. Let hl,h 2 e H(M). h I ~ h e iff 
rM(h1,~) = rM(h2,~) for all ~ e U ~. Definition. M I is k-covered by M 2 iff U MI = U M2, and for every 
h I e Hk(Mi) , there exists h 2 e Hk(M2) such that rM1 (hi,F) = rM2(h2,~) for all ~ e U ~I . Definition. 
M 1 is k-equivalent to M 2 iff M I is k-covered by M 2 and M 2 is k-covered by M 1. The relations k-covered 
by and k-equivalent of conventional QSMs were studied in detail in [9]. III. Realizations and Assignments 
 In this section, various types of realizations and assignments are intro- duced. Properties of these 
realizations and assignments and their relationships -223- are examined. Notation. H*(M) is the collection 
of all non-empty subsets of H(M). Definition. M 2 is a k-realization of MI iff there exists an ordered 
pair (e,8) where: is a function from uMI into uM2, and 8 is a func- tion from H(Mi) into H (M2), such 
that for all u e uMI, hl e H(Mi) and h2 e ~(hl), (i) h2pM2(~(u)) e 8[hlpMl(u)], and  (ii) hl e Hk(M 
I) implies 8(h I) N Hk(M 2) ~ (empty set). The ordered pair (~,8) is a k-assignment of M I into M2. If, 
in addition,  (iii) 8(h I) N Hk(Ms) ~ ~ implies 8(hi) = 8(h{) for some h{ e Hk(MI), then (~,8) is a 
strict k-assignment of M I into M2. In this case, we say that Ms is a strict k-realization of Mi. For 
simplicity, (strict) 1-assignment and (strict) 1-realization will also be called (strict) assignment 
and (strict) realization, respectively. Notation. Let be a function from U MI into U M2. ~ is the func- 
tion from ~M1 into ~M2 such that e(u) = e(u) and e(uu) = e(u)~(u) for all u e U MI and ~ e U MI. Theorem 
3.1. If (~,B) is an assignment of MI into M2 and there ex- ists a matrix Ko such that for every u e U 
MI, h I e H(MI), and h2 e 8(hl), hIQMi M2 --~MI (u)Ko = h2Q (~(u)), then for every u e , hl ~ H(Mi), 
and M h2 e 8(hl), hlQMi (~)Ko = h2Q 2(~(~)). Proof. Follows from Proposition 2.1(b) and induction. 
 Corollary 3.2. Let (~,8) be a k-assignment of M I into M2 and there uMI exists a matrix K 0 such that 
for every u e , h, e H(M I) and h 2 e 8(hl), hiQMI (u)K0 = h2QM2 (e(u)). (a) If ~ is onto, then h~,h~ 
e 8(h~) for some h~ e H(M,) implies hl M2 h~.  (c) If e is the identity function and K 0 = I, then M 
I is k-covered by  (b) If K 0 has linearly independent rows, then h' ,h'~ e H(M I) and I 8(h~) N 8(h~) 
~ ~ implies ' MI h I h~. M2. Notation. Let W be a real vector space, and for i = 1,2,...,n, W. c W 
 1 -- -224- and c i real numbers. The set n ciW i = c~W~+c~W2+...+c W = li-~-nl c.w. : w. e W for all 
1 < i < n I. i=l n n 1 1 1 i ---- Definition. Let 8 be a function from H(M I) into H*(M2). 8 is reg- 
ular iff hl,h 2 e H(M I) and cl,c 2 real numbers such that c + c = 1 im- 1 2 ~iies B(clh I + c2h 2) 
= clS(h I ) + c28(h2). Theorem 3.3. Let B be a function from H(M 1) into H*(M2). The fol- lowing statements 
are equivalent: (i) 8 is regular;  n (2) h. e H(M I) i = 0,l,2,...n, and h 0 = ~ cih i implies 8(h 
0 ) =  l ' i=l ci8 (hi) ; and i=l (3) hl,h 2 e H(M I) and cl,c 2 real numbers such that c I + c 2 
= 1 implies clS(h I) + c28(h 2) C B(clh I + c2h2). Proof. (i) implies (2) follows by induction. (2) 
implies (3) is triv- ial. Thus, i~ suffices to prove (3) implies (i). Suppose condition (3) holds. Then, 
for every hl,h z e H(Mi), and cl,c 2 real numbers such that c I + c 2 = i and c I ~ 0, Cl --~I --1 I 
2 2 I C 8(hi + E2h2 -H2h2) + $28(h 2 ) = 8(h I ) + ~28(h2)- --C 1 C 1 C I C I Hence c18(h I) + c28(h 
2) = ~(clh I + c2h 2) or 8 is regular. MI uM2 Theorem 3.4. Let ~ be a function from U into . If there 
ex- ists a matrix K 0 satisfying the condition that for every h I e Hk(M 2) , there exists h 2 e H k(M 
2) such that hiQ MI (~)K 0 = h2 QM2 (~(~)) for all ~ e ~Mi, then M 2 is a regular k-realization of M 
1. Proof. For every h I ~ H(M I) , let B(h I) = {h 2 e H(M 2) : hiQ MI (~)K 0 = h2 QM2 (~([r)) for all 
~ e U~i}. It follows from the hypotheses that h I e Hk(M I) implies 8(h I) N Hk(M 2) ~ ~. Let u e U MI, 
IT e U MI, h I e H(M I) and h 2 e ~(hl) . Since hiP M1 (u)Q MI (~)K 0 = hl QMI (u~)K 0 = h2 QM2 (~(u~)) 
= h2PM2(~(u))QM2(~(~)), therefore h2pM2(e(u)) e 8[hipMl(u)]. It remains to show that 8 is regular. Let 
h~,h'~ e H(M I) and a,b real numbers such that ! i! iv a + b = l. Let h 2 e 8(h~) and h 2 e 8(hII). 
Then (ah~ + bh2)QM2(~(~)) = 2 iv i 11 (ah' + bhI')QMl (IY)K for all ~ e U M1 Therefore ah'a + bh 2 
e ~(ah I + bh I) or 1 1 0 a~(h{) + b (h~) ~ B(ah~ + bh~). By Theorem 3.3, 8 is regular. -225- Corollary 
3.5. If Mi is k-covered by M2, then M2 is a k-realization of M I . Notation. Ho(M) is the real Euclidean 
space spanned by H(M) and ~0(M)  = {h e H0 (M) : hE = 0}. Theorem 3.6. If is a regular function from 
H(M 1) into H*(M2), then there exists a subspace W of ~0(M2) such that for every h e H(Mi), W = {hl-h2: 
hl-h 2 e 8(h) }. Proof. Let h 0 be a fixed element of H(M 1) and W = {hl-h2: hl-h 2 e 8(h0)}. Since 
8 is regular, W is a subspace of H0(M2). Moreover, 8(h) = 8(h+ho-h o) = 8(h) + 8(ho) -8(h o) and B(h 
o) = 8(ho+h-h) = 8(h o) + 8(h) -8(h) for every h ¢ H(M1). Therefore, W = {hi-h2: hl-h2sS(h)} for every 
h e H(M1). Geometrically, the above theorem states that if 8 is regular, then {8(h) : h e H(M,)} is 
a family of parallel hyperplanes of the same dimension in H0(Mz). The subspace W is the subspace associated 
with 8. Corollary 3.7. Let 8 be a regular function from H(M I) into H*(M2). For every hl,hzeH(M1), 8(h 
I) ~ S(h 2) ~ ~ implies 8(h l) = 8(h2). Notation. Let 8 be a regular function from H(M I) into H*(M2). 
8* = U 8(h) and 8* = 8* A Hk(M2). heH(Ml ) k Theorem 3.8. Let 8 be a regular function from H(M l) into 
H*(M2). For every k=i,2,3, there exists a strict k-matrix K k such that 8~ = {hKk: h is a row matrix 
and a k-matrix}. Moreover, (a) for k = 1 or 3, K can always be chosen to have linearly independent 
k rows, and (b) K 2 can be chosen to have linearly independent rows iff 8 3 is a simplex [4]. Proof. 
Let W* = {hl-h2: hl,h2eS*}. Since 8 is regular, W* is a subspace of H0 (M2). In other words, 81 = 8* 
is a hyperplane in H0 (M2). Therefore, 8* is a convex polytope [4] in H0 (M 2) The conclusions follow 
 2 from these observations. , The matrix K k given above is called a matrix associated with B k. Definition. 
Let (~,8) be a (strict) k-assignment of M I into M 2. If 8 is regular, then (~,8) is a regular (strict) 
k-assignment of M I into M 2. In this case, we say that M 2 is a regular (strict) k-realization of M 
I. If, in addition, for every heH(M1) , 8(h) contains exactly one element, then (~,B) is a reduced (strict) 
k-assignment of M 1 into M 2. In this case, we say that M 2 is a reduced (strict) k-realization of M 
I. If (~,8) is a reduced k-assignment of M 1 into M 2, then we shall identify B with the function from 
H(M I) into H(M 2) which maps every hEH(M I) into the unique element of 8(h). Definition. Let (e,8) 
be a reduced (strict) k-assignment of M I into M 2. (i) (~,8) is a (strict) k-homomorphism of M I onto 
M 2 iff both and B are onto. In this case, we say that M I is (strictly) k-homomorphic to M 2 . (2) 
(a,8) is a state-behavior (strict) k-assignment of M I into M 2 iff both e and B are one-to-one. In this 
case, we say that M 2 is a state- behavior (strict) k-realization of M I.  (3) (e,B) is a (strict) k-isomorphism 
of M I onto M 2 iff both ~ and 8 are one-to-one and onto. In this case, we say that M I is (strictly) 
k- isomorphic to M 2.  Theorem 3.9. M 2 is a reduced (strict) k-realization of M I iff there exists 
a function e from U M1 into U M2 and a (strict) k-matrix K such that for every ueU MI, PMi (u)K = KpM2(a(u)). 
Moreover, (a) M I is (strictly) k-homomorphic to M 2 iff e is onto and the columns of K are linearly 
independent;  (b) M 2 is a state-behavior (strict) k-realization of M I iff e is one- to-one and the 
rows of K are linearly independent; and  (c) M I is (strictly) k-isomorphic to M 2 iff both ~-i and 
K -I exist.  Proof. Suppose (~,B) is a reduced (strict) k-assignment of M l into M 2. Let K be a matrix 
whose rows are 8(h), heH~(M1), arranged in appro- priate order. It can be shown that K has the desired 
properties. Conversely, for every heH(M1), let 8(h) = hK. It can be shown that (~,8) is a desired assignment 
of M I into M 2. The matrix K given above is called the matrix associated with 8. -227- By virtue 
of Proposition 2.5(a), the distinction between reduced strict k-realization and reduced k-realization 
disappears when k = 1 or 3. Corollary 3.10. M I is a (strict) k-submachine of M iff there exists 2 a 
state-behavior (strict) k-assignment of M I into M 2 where ~ is the iden- tity function. It follows 
from the above corollary that the only type of realization considered by Bacon [i] is the state-behavior 
3-realization. Theorem 3.11. M I is strictly 2-homomorphic to M 2 iff M I is strictly 3-homomorphic to 
M 2 . Proof. Let (e,8) be a strict 2-homomorphism of M 1 onto M 2 and K the matrix associated with 8. 
By Theorem 3.9, K is a strict 2-matrix and has linearly independent columns. Therefore, there exists 
a 2-matrix K' such that K'K = I. This is possible only if K is a 3-matrix. Thus (e,8) is a strict 3-homomorphism 
of M I onto M 2. The converse is trivial. Theorem 3.12. M I is strictly 3-isomorphic to M 2 iff M I 
and M 2 are identical except for a renaming of inputs, states and outputs. Proof. Follows from Theorem 
3.9 and the fact that if K is a nonsingular 3-matrix, then K -I = K t. Proposition 3.13(a). If M 2 is 
a (regular) k-realization of M I and M 3 is a (regular) k-realization of M2, then M 3 is a (regular) 
k-realiza- tion of Mi. (b) If M2 is a (regular) strict k-realization of M I with assignment (e,8), where 
8 k = Hk(M2), and M3 is a (regular) strict k-realization of M2, then M 3 is a (regular) strict k-realization 
of M I. Theorem 3.14. If M 2 is a (regular) strict k-realization of M I with assignment (e,8) where e 
is one-to-one and 8 k = Hk(M2), then Mi is a (regular) strict k-realization of M 2. Proof. Let ~, = 
~-i and for every h 2 e H(M ), 8' (h 2) = {h I e H(Mi) : 2 h 2 e 8(hi) }. It can be shown that (e',8') 
is a (regular) strict k-assignment of M 2 into M I . IV. Partitions with Substitution Properties and 
Partition Pairs -228- A partition of M is a family ~ of mutually disjoint nonempty subsets of H(M) 
whose union is equal of H(M). These subsets will be called blocks of n. Each partition n of M defined 
an equivalence relation E(mod n) where h I 5 h2(mod ~) iff h I and h 2 belong to the same block of n. 
 Let ~i and ~2 be partitions of M. ~i ! ~2 iff h I E h2(mod zl) im- plies hl ~ h2(m°d ~2). It can be 
shown that ! is a partial ordering of the collection of all partitions of M. Moreover, the collection 
of all partitions of M forms a complete lattice [2] under ! with a greatest element 1 and least element 
0, where 1 is the partition consisting of only one block and 0 is the partition in which every block 
contains exactly one element. Indeed, Proposition 4.1. Let F be an arbitrary collection of partitions 
of M. Then (i) h' ~ h" (mod Glb{zeF}) iff for all ~ e F, h' E h"(mod ~); and (2) h' E h"(mod Lub(zeF}) 
iff there exist h0,hl,h2, .... h where h0 = h' n and h = h" such that for every 1 < i ~ n, there exists 
~.e F such that n --1 hi_ 1 ~ hi(mod ~i)- Definition. Let ~ be a partition of M. z is regular iff h. 
e B. e l l i=0,1,2, and h 0 = clh I + cah 2 implies B 0 = ciB I + c2B 2. Theorem 4.2. Let ~ be a partition 
of M The following statements are equivalent: (i) z is regular; (2) h. e B. e ~, i=0,i,2 .... n, and 
 n n 1 1 h = ~ c h implies B = ~ c.B.; and (3) h. e B. e ~, i=0,i,2, and 0 i=l ii 0 i=l iI 1 l h 0 = 
c,h I + c2h 2 implies ciB 1 + c2B 2 B 0. Proof. Similar to Theorem 3.3. Theorem 4.3. Let ~ be a partition 
of M. The following statements are equivalent: (i) ~ is regular; (2) There exists a unique subspace W 
of H0 (M) such that hl ~ h2(mod ~) iff hl-h 2 e W; and (3) There exists an affine matrix K such that 
h I E h2(mod ~) iff hiK = h2K. Proof. (i) implies (2) can be proved by a method similar to that used 
in the proof of Theorem 3.6. The rest are trivial. The subspace W and the matrix K above are called, 
respectively, the subspace associated with ~ and a matrix associated with ~. Proposition 4.4. Let ~i 
and ~2 be regular partitions of M and let W i be the matrix associated with hi' i=i,2. Then ~i ! ~2 iff 
W I is a subspace of W 2. Proposition 4.5. Let K 0 be a matrix associated with the regular parti- tion 
z of M. K is a matrix associated with ~ iff K is affine and K = KK' for some matrix K' with linearly 
independent rows. Definition. A regular (strict) k-partition of M is a regular parti- tion of M associated 
with a (strict) k-matrix. By virtue of Proposition 2.5(a), the distinction between regular strict k-partition 
and regular k-partition ceases for k = 1 or 3. Theorem 4.6. The collection of all regular partitions 
of M forms a complete sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of M containing the greatest element 
1 and least element 0. Proof. Let F be an arbitrary collection of regular partitions of M and W~ is 
subspace associated with n E F It follows from Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 4.3 that the subspace associated 
with Gib{~EF} is the intersec- tion of all W~, ~ e F , and the subspace associated with Lub{~eF} is the 
direct sum of all W~, ~ e F . Definition. Let ~ be a partition of M. ~ is a SP-partition of M iff h 
I ~ h2(mod ~) implies hipM(u) ~ h2PM(u) (mod ~) for all u e U M. Proposition 4.7. The collection of 
all SP-partitions of M forms a complete sublattice of the lattice of partitions of M containing the greatest 
element 1 and least element 0. Notation. SP(M) is the collection of all regular SP-partitions of M. 
Proposition 4.8. SP(M) is a complete sublattice of the lattice of par- titions of M containing the greatest 
element 1 and least element 0. Theorem 4.9. Let z be a regular partition of M with associated sub- space 
W. ~ e SP(T) iff W is invariant under all matrices of the form pM(u), u e U M. Proof. Suppose e SP (T) 
. Let h = hl-h 2 e W where hl,h 2 e H(M). Then, for all u e U M, hpM(u) = hipM(u) -hePM(u ) e W. This 
shows that W is invariant under all matrices of the form pM(u), u e U M. The converse follows immediately 
by reversing the steps just given. The above theorem gives an analytic method for finding the regular 
SP-par- -230- titions of a given QSM. Theorem 4.10. Let be a regular partition of M and K a matrix 
as- sociated with ~. n e SP(M) iff for every u e U M, there exists an affine ma- trix P(u) such that 
pM(u)K = KP(u) . U M Proof. Suppose e SP(M) and u e . Then the vector space spanned by the columns 
of pM(u)K is a subspace of the vector space spanned by the columns of K. Thus, pM(u)K = KP' (u) for some 
matrix P' (u), i.e., the matrix equa- tion KX = pM(u)K is solvable. Therefore, for any pseudo inverse 
K + of K and arbitrary affine matrix A(u), P(u) = K+pM(u)K + (I-K+K)A(u) is also a solution of KX = pM(u)K. 
Clearly, P(u) is an affine matrix. The converse is trivial. e The matrices P(u), u U M , may be used 
to define a new QSM M'. Such an M' is called a ~-image of M and K the associated matrix. It is obvious 
that the concept of ~-image defined above is a generalization of the convention- al concept of z-image 
[5]. Moreover, if ~ is a regular 3-partition of M, then by taking K to be a deterministic matrix with 
linearly independent col- umns, the above method for determining P(u) reduces to the conventional "lumping" 
process of matrices [6]. This "lumping" process of matrices was used by Bacon [i] to define SP-partitions. 
 Theorem 4.11. (e,B) is a reduced k-assignment of M I into M 2 where is the identity function and K is 
the matrix associated with 8 iff M 2 ks a ~-image of M I with associated matrix K. Proof. Follows from 
Theorems 3.9 and 4.10. Theorem 4.12. If M 2 is a state-behavior k-realization of M 3 and M 3 is a ~-image 
of M I with associated matrix K 2 such that K 2 is a k-matrix and M 3 is a k-QSM, then M2 is a reduced 
k-realization of M I. The converse is true for k = 1 and 3, but not true in general for k = 2. Proof. 
By virtue of Theorem 4.11 and the transitivity of reduced k-reali- zations, it suffices to prove the 
converse. Let k = 1 or 3, (~,B) a reduced k-assignment of M I into M 2 and K the matrix associated with 
~. Let K I be a submatrix of K oStained by omitting all the rows of K which are linear combinations of 
preceding rows of K. Then K I is a k-matrix which has line- arly independent rows. Moreover, there exists 
a unique matrix K 2 such that K = K2Ki. It is clear that K2 has linearly independent columns and K2 is 
also a k-matrix. Let M 3 be a QSM such that for every u e U M3 = U MI, P M3 (u) = Kz+P MI (u)K where 
K2 + is a pseudo inverse of K 2. By an appropriate choice of K2 +, P M3 (u) can be chosen to be a k-matrix. 
We shall show that M3 has the desired properties. Let u e U MI , KiP M2 (c~(u)) = Kz+K2KiP M2 (~(u)) 
= Kz+KP M2 (c~(u)) = Kz+P MI (u)K = K2+pMi (u)K2K I = pM3 (u)K I Theref.ore, M z is a state-behavior 
k-realization of M 3. Moreover, PMi (u)Kz = PMI(u)K2KIKi + = PMi (u)KKl + = KpMz(~(u))Ki + = KzK ip M2 
(~(u))K1 + = K2 PM3 (u)KiK1 + = K2 PM3 (u) Thus, M 3 is a ~-image of Mi. This completes the proof. From 
the above proof, it follows that a sufficient condition for the con- verse of Theorem 4.12 to hold for 
k = 2 is that the convex span of the rows of K is a simplex. Definition. Let 171 and 17z be (regular) 
partitions of M. (~1,172) is a (regular) partition pair of M iff h I 5 h z (mod 171) implies hipM(u) 
--- M h2pM(u) (mod ~2) for all u E U . Proposition 4.13. is a SP-partition of M iff (17,17) is a partition 
pair of M. Notation. PP(M) is the collection of all regular partition pairs of M. Definition. Let (171 
#II2) and (173,174i be partition pairs of M. (~1,172) ~ (~3,~4) iff 171 < 173 and 172 < 174. Proposition 
4.14. (a) < is a partial ordering of the collection of all partition pairs of M. (b) The collection 
of all partition pairs of M forms a complete lattice under (c) PP(M) is a complete sublattice of the 
col- lection of all partition pairs of M. Theorem 4.15. Let 17i be a regular partition of M with associated 
matrix Ki, i = 1,2. (171,172)ePP(M) iff for every ueU M, there exists affine matrix P(u) such that pM(u)K2 
= KiP(u). Proof. Similar to Theorem 4.10. We shall conclude this section by introducing a new type 
of operation of -232- matrices and regular partitions of M. These operations play an important role 
in subsequent discussions. Definition. Let K I = (aij) and K s = (a[j) be real matrices of order n×r 
and n×t, respectively. The matrix KlOK 2 is a matrix of order nxrt such that the (i,j)-th entry of KlOK 
2 is a! a~ where j = (p-l)t+q. In ip lq other words, the i-th row of KiOK 2 is obtained by taking all 
possible products of the i-th row of K I with the i-th row of K 2. In general, let Ki,K2,...,K n be matrices 
having the same number of rows, then n X K. = K I 0 K 0 ... 0 K = (K1oK20...OKn_ I) 0 K i=l l 2 n n 
O Proposition 4.16. (KiOK2)OK3 = KiO(K20K3). Proposition 4.17. If K is a deterministic matrix, then 
K(Ki°K2) = KKI OKK 2" Proposition 4.18. If K' and K' are matrices with linearly independent 1 2 rows, 
then KiK I 'OK2K ~ = (KiOK2)K for some matrix K with linearly independent rows Indeed the (i j)-th entry 
of K is a I a 2 where i=(k-l)t+~, ' ' kp £q j=(p-l)r+q, K I ' = (a~)j , K 2 ' = (a~j ), and t×r is 
the order of K'i" The above proposition justifies the following definition: Definition. Let ~i and ~2 
be regular partitions of M. z10~ 2 is the regular partition of M with associated matrix KiOK 2 where 
K i is the matrix associated with ~i' i=i,2. In general, if ~i,~2,...,~ are regular n partitions of 
M, then n i=iX ~i = °~n ~1°~20 .... (~I°~2°'''°~n-i)OWn"  Proposition 4.19. (a) zi0~2 = ~20~i. (b) 
zi0(~20~3) = (~10~2)0~3. (c) ~i°n2 ! Glb{~l,~2}. Proposition 4.18 also justifies the following definition: 
 Definition. Let H i be regular partitions of M with associated matrix Ki, i=l,2,...,n. The sequence 
{~I,~2,-..,~n} is independent iff for every ueU M, n n PM(u) X Ki = X pM(u)Ki i=l i=l If the ~i's are 
regular 3-partitions and the Ki's are chosen to be 3-matrices with linearly independent columns, then 
the above definition reduces to that given by Bacon [i]. By virtue of Proposition 4.17, if M is a DSM, 
every sequence of regular partitions of M is independent. V. Networks of QSMs In this section a mathematical 
formulation of networks of concurrently operating QSMs is introduced. The concept of loop-free networks 
of QSMs is also defined. More- over, necessary and sufficient conditions for a given QSM to be realizable 
by an arbitrary network and loop-free network of QSMs are given. Consider an arbitrary network of n 
SSMs, Mi,M2,...,M n. When the network is viewed as a single stochastic system, a typical transition probability 
of the network is ' . ~' v' ' ... v'lu Sl,S ..... Sn,V;,V2, (5.1) p(s~ s 2 ..... n' I'v2 ' ' n ' 2 
.... Vn) where s i,s~l are states of Mi; vi,v~l outputs of Mi; and u input to the system. From the assumption 
that the M i operate independently, it follows that (5.1) may be rewritten as p(s~,v I l u,sl ..... s 
n,v I ..... v n)p(s~,v 2 l u,sl ..... s n,v I ..... v n) ..p(s~,VnlU,Sl ..... s n v I ..... v n) . (5.2) 
The i-th factor of (5.2) is the transition probability of M i when the input (U,Sl,...,Si_l,Si+l,...,Sn,Vl,...,Vi_l,Vi+l,...,Vn) 
is applied. The foregoing discussion suggests the following definition of networks of QSMs: Definition. 
A network M with n component machines is a QSM where (i) both S M and V M are cartesian products of 
n finite non-empty sets, i.e., sM = n and vM = vMxvMx'''xVi~2I and sIMxsM×'''xsM2 ; M (ii) for each 
l<i<n, there exists a real valued function pz with domain , M vi,vie~i; and ueU M, (sMx"Z vzjM'xuMx(sMxvM) 
such that for every si,sieSi," ' l .. l l i .. llUtSl, s ,. , pM(s~'s2 '" 'Sn'V1'V2'" 'Vn 2 "" Sn'V1'V2

1 ..... Sn,V I ..... Vz_l,V£+ 1 ..... Vn),Sz,V £) = p (sl,v u'sl's2'''''Sn'V1'V2'''''Vn)" -234- In 
what follows, M will always denote a network with component machines M I,M 2,...,M n. Moreover, M = {M 
I,M e,...,M n}. Proposition 5.1. Let k=i,2,3. M is a k-QSM iff for every l<_£<n, MZ is a k-QSM. Definition. 
M is a k-network iff M is a k-QSM. Notation. For every l<£<n and UeU M, pM(u) is the matrix whose (i,j)-th 
 M entry is pz(wjlu,w i) where wi'3 is the j-th element of S~× and w,l is the i-th element of sMxv M. 
With an appropriate choice of ordering relation for sMxv M it follows that for every ueU M , r n i=l 
 Notation. Let hEH(M) and li~<n, h £ will denote the sod of M~ where for every w~eS~x~' h£ (w£) = ~M 
h (w I ,w 2 , .... ,w n) wieSi×~i In general, if J = {jl,j2,...,jr} is a subsequence of {l,2,...,n}, 
h J will denote a real valued function with domain ~ (sM x VN. ) such that for every M i=l Ji 3i M 
 wjieSji × Vji, i=i,2 .... ,r, h J(wj ,w. ,. ~ h(w ,Wn) i 32 "''wj r) = M M I 'w2,''" wieSi×Vi i~J 
The same symbol h J will also be used to denote the row matrix or vector whose j-th component is hJ(xj) 
where xj is the j-th element of the domain of h J. Notation. Let K be the matrix whose rows are sod of 
M and J a subsequence of {1,2 .... ,n}. Then K J will denote a matrix whose i-th row is h J. where h. 
is l l the i-th row of K. For simplicity, we shall write K i for K J if £ is the only element in J. 
Definition. Let (e,8) be a reduced assignment of M 0 into M. Then, for every subsequence J of {l,2,...,n}, 
15~k, %<n, hl,h2eH(M 0) and h 3 = 8(hl) , J J h~ = 8(h2), (i) h, ~ h 2 (mod Tj) iff h 3 = h~ ; and (2)

of M 0 under (e,8). Proposition 5.2. Let (~,8) be a reduced assignment of M 0 into M and K the -235- 
 associated matrix of 8. Then, for every subsequence J of {l,2,...,n}, K J is a matrix associated with 
Tj. Proposition 5.3. Pk,i =i iff pzM(s~ ,v lu,sz,s 2,..', Sn,Vl,V 2 ,--',v n) is inde- pendent of s 
k e S M and v k s V M. k k Definition. Let J be a subsequence of {l,2,...,n} and L = {M. : ieJ}. l Define 
~ (L) = Tj . Proposition 5.4. If (~,8) is a reduced 3-realization, then ~(L1U L2) = (LI) 0 ~(L2) Definition. 
For every 1 < i, j < n. M. is a predecessor of Mj iff Pi,j ~ i. By virtue of Proposition 5.3, M. is 
a predecessor of M. iff the transition l 3 probabilities of Mj is dependent on the present state and 
output of M i- Definition. L C ~ is a closed set of M iff L contains all the predecessors of machines 
in L. Proposition 5.5. The collection of all closed sets of M forms a lattice under set intersection 
and union. . U M ' Notation. Let J be a subsequence of {1,2,. ,n} and u e Then [PjM(u) I t = I [pM(u) 
I tl J , where t represents transpose of a matrix. Remark: ~P~(u) ~ P~I(u) even if J = {4}. Proposition 
5.6. Let J be a subsequence of {l,2,...,n} and L = {Mi : i e J}. L is a closed set of M iff for every 
u e U M, [pM(u)I J = IJ IpM(u)] J, where I is the identity matrix. In other words, for every ~ e J, 
PZM is independent of s k e S k M and v k e V k M for all k ~ J. Definition Let L ~ M. The closure ~(L) 
of L is the smallest closed set of M containing L. The operator ~ will be referred to as the closure 
operator of M. If L contains exactly one machine MZ, then we shall write ~(Mz) instead of  C ({M~}). 
 Proposition 5.7. The closure operator ~ of M satisfies the folowing condi- tions: (a) L C_ ~(L); (b) 
El C~L2 implies ~(L1) C_ ~(L2); (c) ~(L) = L iff L is a close/ set of M; (d) ~ (~(L)) = C (L) ; (e) ~(L)

~(Lz) 63 ~(L2). Definition. Let 1 < i, j < n. M i is dependent on Mj iff Mj e ~(Mi). In symbols, Mj 
÷ M i. Moreover, M i +~ Mj iff M i ÷ Mj and Mj + M i. -236- Proposition 5.8. (a) The relation ÷ is reflexive 
and transitive. (b) The relation ÷+ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.  (c) S. ÷÷ M. iff _~(S 
i) = _~(Mj).  l 3 Definition. M is loop-free iff ~(Mi) ~ ~(Mj) for all 1 < i, j <_ n and i ~ j. It 
is clear that every network is isomorphic to a loop-free network. In the rest of this section, necessary 
and sufficient conditions for a given QSM M 0 to be realizable by a network M are derived. Definition. 
A matrix K is of order n iff the rows of K are sod of some net- work M with n component machines. Theorem 
5.9. Let M be a k-QSM. If there exists a reduced k-assignment (~,8) of M 0 into M where ~ is an identity 
function, then there exists a sequence {~,~i,z2,...,~ n} of regular SP-partitions of M 0 satisfying the 
following con- ditions: (a) there exists a k-matrix K of order n associated with ~;  (b) for every 
1 < £ < n, there exists a subsequence J£ of {1,2,...,n} such that K JZ is a matrix associated with ~; 
 I  (C) for every 1 < Z <_n, (~£,z[) is a partition pair of M0 where ~£ is the regular partition of 
M0 with associated matrix K£; and  (d) for every 1 <_ £ <_n, pseudo inverse (KJ£) + of K J£, and u c 
U M, there ex-  ists a matrix A£(u) such that KJZAz(u) = 0, (KJ£)+pM(u)K ~ + A£(u) is a k-matrix, 
and pM0 (u)K = K I Ji (KJi)+P M0 (u)K i + A (u) (5.3) l=l i In addition, if M is loop-free, then (e) 
the collection of subsequence Jz, 1 ! Z ! n, given in (b) can be chosen in such a way that Ji ~ Jj for 
every 1 ! i, j ! n and i @ j. Proof. Let K with the matrix associated with 8. Then, for every u E U M, 
 pM0 (u)K = ~ i=~ e~u) ~54) Define ~ = ~(~) and for every 1 ! i ! n, ~£ = ~[ ~(M£)]. (a) K is a matrix 
of order n associated with ~. Moreover, by (5.4), e SP(M0).  (b) By Proposition 5.2, K Ji is a matrix 
associated with ~£ where J£ is a subsequence such that C(M£) = {M i : i e J£}, 1 ! £ ! n. Moreover, by 
(5.4),  -237- = i KIpM(u)] J% U M" for all 1 < £ < n and u e By virtue of Proposition 5.5, M M 
(5.5) for all u e and 1 <_ £ < n. This implies that n£ e SP (M0) for all 1 < £ < n. (c) Clearly, for 
every 1 < Z <_ n, £ e J£. Thus, by (5.5), = pM (u)] Z M P M° (u)K ~ KJ£ I Jz (5.6) for all u e U and 
1 < % < n. This implies that (~Z,~[) e PP(M0) for all 1 < £ < n. ca) It follows from (5.6) that for every 
1 < £ < n, pseudo inverse (KJ£) + of K J£ , and u e U M , there exists a matrix A£(u) such that KJ£A 
(u) = 0 and  [pM (u)]~ = (KJ~)+pM(u)K~ + A (u). (5.7) J£ £ Moreover, by Proposition 5.5, = (5.8) 
M for all u e U and 1 ~ £ ! n. Substitution of (5.7) and (5.8) in (5.4) yields (5.3). (e) If M is loop-free, 
then for every 1 _< i, j _< n where i ~ j, ~(M.)i ~ ~(Mj), i.e., Ji ~ J£" Theorem 5.10. If there exists 
a sequence {~,~i,~2,''. ~n } of regular partitions of M0 satisfying conditions (a), (b) and (d) of Theorem 
5.9, then there exists a k-network M with component machines M,,M2,...,Mn, satisfying the following conditions: 
(i) M is a reduced k-realization of M0; (ii) ~(M) = ~ and for every 1 ! £ ! n, ~ = ~ and ~[ ~ ] = (M 
i ) ' (M£) ; and (iii) M. e ~(Mj) iff Ji is a subsequence of Jj. Z i In addition, if condition (e) of 
Theorem 5.9 is also satisfied, then M can be chosen to be loop-free. Proof. For every 1 ! £ ! n and u 
e U M°, let  P~(u) = IJ~ [(KJ~)+pM°(u)K ~ + A~(u) 1 . Moreover, let M be a network with n component 
machines such that for every u e U M° , n pM(u) = Pi (u) OP (u)0...OP (U) = i~=l Pi(U) 2 n " It can 
be shown that M satisfies conditions (i)-(iii). In addition, M is loop- free if condition (e) of Theorem 
5.8 is satisfied. Combining Theorems 5.9 and 5.10 yields a necessary and sufficient condition for a given 
QSM M 0 to be realizable by a network M. This result, at the same time, exhibits the internal structure 
of the network M, i.e., the dependency between any two component machines. Another criterion is derived 
below which does not exhibit -238- this internal structure of M. Theorem 5.11. Let M be a k-QSM. If 
there exists a reduced k-realization (e,8) of M 0 into M where ~ is the identity function, then there 
exists a regular SP- partition n of M 0 satisfying the following conditions: (a) there exists a k-matrix 
K of order n associated with ~;  (b) for every 1 < % ! n, (~,~') e PP(M 0) where ~ is a regular partition 
of  --£ £ M0 with associated matrix Ki; and (c) for every 1 ! £ ! n, pseudo inverse K + of K, and 
u e U M, there exists a matrix A (u) such that KA£(u) = 0, K+pM° (u)K £ + A£(u) is a k-matrix, and PM° 
(u)K = K ~ [K+pM° (u)K i + Ai(u)]. (5.9) Proof. Let K be the matrix associated with 8 and ~ = ~(M). 
(a) Follows from condition (a) of Theorem 5.9.  (b) From (5.4), for every 1 ! ~ ! n and u e U M,  
PM°(u)K£ = KpM(u). (5.10) This implies that (~,~) e PP(M 0) for every 1 ! ~ ! n. (c) From (5.10), for 
every 1 ! Z ! n, pseudo inverse K + of K, and u e U M, there exists a matrix A£(u) such that KA (u) = 
0 and P~(u) = K+pM° (u)K ~ + A£(u). (5.11) Substituting (5.11) into (5.4) yields (5.9). Theorem 5.12. 
If there exists a regular partition ~ of M 0 satisfying conditions (a) and (c) of Theorem 5.11, then 
there exists a k-network M with com- ponent machines M I,M~,...,Mn, such that M is a reduced realization 
of M 0, ~(M) = ~, and, for every 1 _< Z _< n, _~(M ) = ~'.£ Proof. For every 1 < ~ < n and u ~ U M°, 
let P (u) = K+P M0 (u)K ~ + A (u). _ _ ~ £ Moreover, let M be a network with n component machines such 
that for every u e U M°, mS(u) = ~ P. (u). i=l 1 It can be shown that M has the desired properties. The 
above results may be strengthened for a particular class of reduced realization which will be defined 
below. Definition. Let K be a matrix whose rows are sod of M. K is admissible iff (i) K = KIOK2O...OK 
n and (ii) KP. = KP', i=l,2,...,n implies K(PlOP2O.-.OPn) = i i K(p,op,o...op~) where for 1 < i < n, 
P. is a matrix whose rows are sod of M i. 1 --2 --~ l Definition. Let (~,8) be a reduced assignment 
of M 0 into M, and K the matrix associated with B. (~,8) is admissible iff ~ is the identity function 
and -239- K is admissible. In this case, we say that M is an admissible reduced realization of M 0 
. Theorem 5.13. If M is an admissible reduced realization of M0, then there ex- ists two sequences {~{,~,...,~A} 
and {zi,~2,...,~ n} of regular partitions of M0 satisfying the following conditions: (a) K is admissible 
where K = K10K2O-..OK n and K~ is a matrix associated with ' 1 < £ < n; ~i' ---- (b) for every 1 < 
~ < n, there exists a subsequence Ji of {1,2, .... n} such that z£ = i~eJ£ ~i" " (c) {~i,~2 ..... ~n

K K*P M° (ulK l, where K is the generalized inverse of K. In addition, if M is loop-free, then condition 
(e) of Theorem 5.9 is also satisfied.  Proof. Follows from Theorem 5.9 and the fact that K is admissible. 
 Theorem 5.14. If there exists two sequences {~{'~['''''~'}n and {~J,~2,...,~n} of regular partitions 
of M0 satisfying conditions (a) -(e) of Theorem 5.13, then there exists a network M with component machines 
MI,M2,...,Mn, satisfying the fol- lowing conditions: (i) M is an admissible reduced realization of MQ; 
_ = ' and ~ [~(M~)] = ~£; and  (ii) ~(M) = ~ and for every 1 < £ ! n, ~(M£) ~  (iii) M i e ~(Mj) iff 
Ji is a subsequence of Jj. In addition, if condition (e) of Theorem 5.9 is also satisfied, then M can 
be chosen to be loop-free. Proof. By Theorem 4.15 and condition (d) of Theorem 5.9, for every 1 ! ~ ! 
n and u e U M, there exists matrix P£(u) such that PM°(u)K i = KJ£Pi(u). Let M be a network with n component

3-realization (e,8) where is the identity function, is admissible. For reduced 3-realization, the above 
re- sults may be further strengthened. Theorem 5.16. If there exists a regular 3-assignment (~,8) of 
M 0 into M where e is the identity function, then there exists a sequence {~,~,...,~} of independent

(~,~) e PP(M 0) for every 1 < £ <_ n. Moreover, by (5.4), (5.10) and Proposition 4.17, for every u e

regular 3-partitions of M 0 such that for every 1 <_ ~ < n, t ! I (~,n[) e PP(M 0) where ~ = ~Io~2o...o~

3-matrix associated with ~'. Since (~,~') e PP(M0), by Theorem 4.15, for every u e U M°, there exists 
a 1-matrix P (u) £ £ such that pM0 (u)K £ = KP£(u), where K = K1oK2o.. K n. Indeed, we may take Pz(u) 
= K+P M° (u)K £ + (I-K+K)A(u) , where K + is any pseudo inverse of K and A(u) any 1-matrix. Thus, if 
M 0 is a k-QSM, P£(u) can be chosen to a k-matrix by an appropriate choice of K + and A(u). Let M be 
a network with n component ma- chines such that for every u e U M°, pM(u)=P I (u) o...oP (u). It can 
be shown that M n has the desired properties. Theorem 5.18. If there exists a reduced 3-realization 
(e,B) of M 0 into M where e is the identity function and M is loop-free, then there exists a sequence 
{~i,~2,...,~ n} of regular 3-SP-partitions of M 0 satisfying the following conditions: (a) for every

that ~ = ~ ; and 1o -241- ' ~' } is independent, where ~' = ~ if J' = $. (b) the sequence {~'n2'''''

has the desired properties. Theorem 5.19. Let M 0 be a k-QSM. If there exists a sequence {~1,~2,...,nn} 
 of regular 3-SP-partitions of M 0 satisfying conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 5.18, then there exists 
a loop-free k-network M with component machines Mi,M2,...,M , n satisfying the following conditions: 
 (i) M is a reduced 3-realization of M0;  (ii) for every 1 < £ < n, q(S£) = ~' and ~ [e(M )] = ~ ; and 
  (iii) M.l e _~(Mj) iff ~.l > ~'3 or i = j. Proof. For every 1 ~ Z ~ n, let K Z be a matrix associated 
with ~' . Then K = K1oK2o...oKn is a matrix associated with ~ = ' ' ....o~ Moreover, for every ~io~2o 
1 ! ~ ~ n, K J~ is a matrix associated with ~, where J£ J U{~}. Let 1 < Z < n. ' (~ Since ~£ e SP(M

such that PM0(u)K£ = KJ£P (u). If M ' % 0 is a k-QSM, P£(u) can be chosen to be a k-matrix. Let M be 
a network with n com- ponent machines such that for every u e U M°, pM(u) = 1~=nlIJ Pi(u) It can be 
shown that M has the desired properties. Theorem 5.9 to 5.19 above can all be restated using state-behavior 
realization. Indeed, M is a state-behavior realization of M 0 iff the partition ~ given in those theorems 
is i. In this case, for every 1 ! £ ! n, (~,~i) e PP(M 0) is auto- matically satisfied and thus may be 
omitted if it occurs. The reader who is familiar with the Hartmanis theory [5] will recall that quite 
often one encounters a "don't care" condition in the specification of a component machine of a decomposition. 
This is a consequence of the fact that the matrices P (u) £ in the proof of the above theorems need 
not be unique. A slightly weaker form of Theorems 5.17 and 5.19 can be found in [i]. Although the proof 
given above for Theorems 5.17 and 5.19, and the proof of the corresponding theorems of [i] are both constructive, 
the methods for which the component machines are constructed are entirely different. The procedure given 
in [i] is essentially the same as the construction of a local machine introduced in [5]. On the other 
hand, in the above proof, the component machines are determined by solving certain simple matrix equations.
