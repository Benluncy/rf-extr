 ABSTRACT Geometric tolerances specify the allowable limit of manu­facturing imperfectness from the ideal 
design geometry. An actual feature is acceptable if it can be contained within the spatiaf tolerance 
zone. An unambiguous representation of thepossiblevariationoftheallowedactuaffeatureisre­quired for the 
development of computer-aided tolerancing systems. A general definition of the geometric tolerance is 
used as our basis, which includes the form, orientation, and position tolerances in the standards. Based 
on geometric characteristics of machined surfaces, an actual feature model is initiated as small position 
and orientation varia­tions of boundary faces of the nominaf solid. The spatial constraint imposed on 
the acceptable feature is interpreted as a containment condition of the actual feature model by its corresponding 
portion of the tolerance zone. This condi­tion is systematically derived in terms of Iincar inequalities 
based on the polyhedral approximation of the tolerance zone boundary. This paper discussed theoretical 
aspects of the method. Implementation of the system and evaluation of its applicability for analyzing 
machine parts with com­plex tolerance specifications are considered as following steps in our future 
work. 1. INTRODUCTION Any machine parts have geometric deviations due to their production. The deviation 
affects position, orientation and/or motion of parts in an assembly. It consequently causes various functional 
uncertainties of mechanical products. Designers control such deviations by assigning tolerances to features 
composing the part. International standards define about a dozen types of geometric toler­ances as Lhe 
basic tolerancing methods [2]. Form toler­ances such as straightness, flatness, roundness, and cylin­dricity 
tolerances are used for controlling form deviations of a single feature. Parallelism, perpendicularity, 
angular­ity, and position tolerances control orientation and position Pernw++nn (o copy without fee all

flat face with re­spect to other reference features. Since the accuracy is of primary concern in machine 
design, tolerances should be ideally as close to zero as possible. However, tolerances given too tightly 
inevitably raise the manufacturing cost and reduce product competi­tiveness in the market. Tolerance 
optimization is thus im­portant to ensure the acceptable functional and economical quality of the product. 
Despite the importance of the proper specification of the tolerance, machine designers in general still 
rely on their experiences and costly trials and errors. Much efforts are needed in developing appropriate 
methods for computer assistance of tolerance specification and distribution. 1.1Brief Review of Prior 
Studies An actual feature is acceptable in geometric Lolerancing if it can be contained within a spatial 
tolerance zone. Math­ematical interpretation of the geometric tolerance, espe­cially an unambiguous representation 
of the possible variation of the allowed actual feature is indispensable to the development of computer-aided 
tolerancing systems [5]. As solid modeling becomes to play an important role in mechanical CAD systems, 
much research work has been given to achieve the solid model based interpretation [4][12]. Requicha proposed 
a general representation of the tolerance zone based on offsetting the nominal solid boundary [9] [10]. 
Jayaraman and Srinivasan proposed a theoretical basis for describing conditions on allowable variations 
for assembling two parts or for maintaining ma­terial bulks [3]. Based on Requicha s definition, Fleming 
proposed a SUP-INF algorithm based method for calculat­ing the deviation stack-up in assemblies [1]. 
Turner and Wozny defined an actual feature model as position varia­tions of boundary faces of the nominal 
solid. Valid Iimirs of the variations are directly defined based on the dimen­sion tolerance description 
[14] [15]. An extension of their method for treating the geometric tolerance is proposed by Liu and Dong 
[5]. 2nd ACM Solid Modeling 93-5 /93/Monmeal, Canada e6 h (1) A position tolerance assigned to a slot

Figure 10utline of the geometric tolerance interpretation method. 1.2 Outllne of the New Method In this 
paper, a new solid model based interpretation of the geometric tolerance is proposed. In this study, 
the ideal geometry of a part is assumed to be a polyhedral object. Only one type of dimensions specifying 
a distance be­twtxm two parallel faces is considered. It is the major type of dimensions imposed on polyhedral 
parts. Figure 1 illustrates the outline of the method with a slot feature F] to which a position tolerance 
is assigned. A mathematical model of the actual slot Ml is initiated as a plate-like unbounded thin solid 
(figure 1(2)) based on the geometricproperties of the machined surface. According to the tolerance specification 
on F], a tolerance zone TZP1 is derived (figure 1(3)) by offsetting and parametric modi­fications of 
F,. Curved surface portions of the tolerance zone boundary are approximated by a set of flat faces. A 
slicing face is defined as it contains an edge sur­rounding the nominal feature F] and perpendicularlyinter­sects 
F1. For eight surrounding edges el, e4, es, eG,e7, e8, eg, and elo of FI, eight slicing faces s~~l,.fIA 
.$~s,$feb. $?7, .rfc8, Sfe9, and Sfel o are defined (figure 1(4)). A41 and TZPI are sliced by these faces, 
and a solid portion of the actual feature model p(hfl) (figure 1(5)) and a solid portion of the tolerance 
zone P(7ZPI) (figure 1(6)) are obtained. The spatial constraint imposed on the acceptable ac­tual feature 
is interpreted in this study by a containment condition of p(Ml) by p(TZPl) (figure 1(7)). Because of 
the geometric similarity between p(M1) and p(TZPl ), the condition can be represented in terms of linear 
inequalities by using an extended method developed by Turner [16]. 1.3 Relationships to Prior Studies 
Our interpretation derives the constraints to the acceptable feature in terms of linear inequalities. 
Various mathemati­cal analysis tools are thus applicable for solving tolerance related problems. For 
example, linear programming method can derive possible deviation stack-up if the refer­ence of a position 
tolerance has dependencies on other tolerances. Our approach has some similarities to prior studies proposed 
by Turner and Wozny [ 14][ 15], and Liu and Dong [5]. Those methcds prepared a specific procedure for 
interpreting each tolerance definition in the standards. On the other hand, a generaI definition of the 
geometric toler­ance is used as our basis, which includes the form, orienta­tion and position tolerances 
in the standards. Our method is thus applicable to any features of a polyhedral part, such as complex 
slots, holes, steps, and so on. The algebraic constraints to the allowed variation of actual features 
are systematically derived based on the spatial condition be­tween the actual feature model and the tolerance 
zone. 2. GEOMETRIC TOLERANCE DEFINITIONS The basic idea of the geometric tolerance is to control de­viations 
of actual features by a spatial tolerance zone. We propose the definition of a tolerance zone as a spatial 
re­gion, measured with respect to a correct geomaricfeature. This is an extension of the definition made 
by Requicha [9][10]. EF(F) =Hl v Hzu !13 Figure 2 Section view of a nominal slot F and its extended feature 
EF(F), 2.1 Basic Definitions As a preparation, some basic definitions are informally given. (1) Feature: 
A nominal shape of a machine part is de­fined by a solid Sin boundary representation [6]. A nominal surface 
feature FI is a homogeneous two-di­ mensional set of faCeS til ,~2, ....fij. ...} of S. The boundary 
of an actual part P is assumed to be decom­posed into a set of actual features G, = [g,], gi2, .... g,,, 
...). Due to linear boundary decomposition, one-to­one correspondence between sets G,, F,, and their 
el­ ements can be established. (2) Extended feature: A geametric tolerance asserts a constraint between 
a bounded actual feature and un­bounded surfaces associated with the nominal fea­ture. A concept of exlendedfeamres 
proposed in [9] is used to describe the relationship. An extended feature EF(F) of a feature F is defined 
as an un­bounded solid based on a regularizal Boolean union and/or intersection of some half spaces H,. 
Whereby the boundary of EF(F) contains F, and the material side of EF(F) and F agree (see figure 2). 
 (3) Offset solid: A positive offset solid O(D; S) of a solid S in E3 with D 20 can be defined as O(D; 
S) =  {p: Disf(p, S) < D) where Dis@, S) denotes the dis­tance between a point p and a solidS{11 ]. 
 (4) Parametrized feature: Geometric tolerances do not control dimensional deviations. In order to incorpo­rate 
this characteristic, the concept of parametrized feaiures is introduced. A parametrized feature PF(AD; 
F) represents a modification of a nominal feature F by changing a vector of it.. associating di­mensions 
D by AD. A coordinate frame WF is em­bedded somewhere in F to represent the position of F in a reference 
frame. For example, the coordinate frame of a slot is placed with its X and Y axes on the center plane, 
and its Yand Z axes on the bottom face (figure 3(l)). By using the same procedure, a cwxdi­nate frame 
WpF(AD~ can be embedded in its paramc­terized feature PF(AD; F). As shown in figure 3(2), the position 
of PF(AD; F) is determined according to its coordinate frame WP~(A~i F), which has corre­sponding axes 
to the frame WFof F. 379 /? / 0.2: Position tolerance F1 j ./ Fi z x WF z / # /w x @ (1) PF(DA; F)

same position. 2.2 Tolerance Zone Definltlon A reference of correct orientation or position in geomernc 
tolerartcing is given by a datum [2]. A single datum is a geometric element with perfect form and is 
fitting to an ac­tual feature according to some designated rules. An or­dered datum system is defined 
to establish a reference by using a group of datums. If an ordered datum system com­posed by three datum 
planes A, B, and C is given, the pri­mary datum A is initially positioned by establishing a proper fitting 
with its corresponding actual plane. After­ward, the datumB is positioned to establish anotherfitting, 
but is additionally constrained to be perpendicular to A. Finally the datum C is positioned to fit maintaining 
per­pendicularityto both A andB. Special-case based definitions of tolerances in the standardscan be 
replaced with a general definition as fol­lows. Let F be a nominal feature. A correct geometric fea­tureIFg 
is defined as IF~ = Tr#F(AD~; F)) (2.1) where AD~ is an ~bitrary dimension change vector. If IFg is used 
as a reference for controlling only form deviations, Z rtshould be an arbitraryrigid-body transformation 
[3]. Otherwise, Trgis a rigid-body transformationfor maintain­ing the coordinate frame of PF(AD~; F) 
in the correct ori­entation or in the correct position, with respect to the da­tum. A tolerance zone 
7Z~ is defined as a spatial region in which the distance measumd from the boundaryof EF(]F8) is less 
than or equal to half of the tolerancs value Tg. Such regionis obtainedasaregularizedBoolean intersection[8] 
of two offset solids as follows: Figure 4 Section view of a tolerance zone T@ based on a correct positwn 
feature IFp~. lZ~ = O(T~/2 EF(lF~)) n* O(Z ~, c*(EF(lF~))) (2.2) where c (EF(lFg)) denotes the regularized 
complement of EF(lFg). An actual feature is acceptable if it can be con­tained within ZZ~.Figure 4 gives 
a section view of an in­stance of thecorrect position featureIFP1 and a tolerance zone TZ l corresponding 
to a position tolerance specified in figure l(l). 3. HOMOGENEOUS TRANSFORMATION Homogeneous transformation 
[7] is used as a tool for de­riving algebraicconstraints,representingboth spatialrela­tionships between 
geometric elements and variations of features. 3.1 Transformation Matrix A homogeneous transformation 
T in E3 is a 4 x 4 marnx. The fust three column vectors of T represent the trans­formed x, y and z axis 
directions of the reference coordi­nate frame W. The fourth column vector represents the transformed 
position of the origin of W. In the following explanation, a particularcolumn vector of a transformation 
matrixisthusreferredtobyasuperscriptx,y,zoroof the matrix. For example, ~ denotes the first column vector 
of T. 3.2 Treatment of Feature Geometry A nominal feature F hasitsown coordinateframeW~rep­resenting 
its position. If a unique coordinate frame Ws is assigned to a nominal solid S of the machine part, the 
po­sition of F with respect to Ws is defined as a transforma­tion sTF which maps the axes of Ws to the 
axes of the fea­ ture frame WF. A polyhedral solid S is composed of a set of flat faces, straightlineedges 
andvertices.Auniquecoordimte frame is also assigned to such composing element as follows (see also figure 
5); ,f z Ze+ x x h w x~ Figure 5 Assignment offiames to aface, an edge, and a vertex. (1) Flat face: 
A coordinate frame Wf is assigned so that its origin is lying somewhere on a face~and its z axis is along 
the normal vector off. (2) Straight line edge: A frame WCis assigned so that its origin is somewhere 
on an edge e and its x axis is along the direction of e.  (3) Vertex: A frame W, is assigned so that 
its origin is on a vertex v.  A transformation which maps the axes of W~to the axes of the above mentioned 
frame uniquely determines the geom­etry of the element. 3.3 Spatial Relationships between Eiements Some 
spatial relationships between flat faces, straight line edges, and vertices can be algebraically described 
as fol­lows. (1) Perpendicularity of two faces: Two perpendicular facesfi and fz must satisfy; ~l.Tfi=O 
(3.1) I fl and Tfl denote transformations representing the geometry of~l and~2 in the same reference 
frame. (2) Relationships between a faes and a vertex: Possi­ble relationships between a face f and a 
vertex v can be classified as follows; v is on a plane p including fi ~.~=Tj.~ (3.2) v is above or on

simultaneous equations must be satisfied; T~.~X=() (3.5) T~.~O=T~ ~ { Tfand T. denote the geometry of 
~and e. 3.4 Modifications of Feature Small modifications of a feature are txeated by slightly changing 
the position and orientation of the feature and/or its component faces. (1) Modification of feature position: 
A small change of position and orientation of a feature F from TFto TF + dTF can be expressed in terms 
of a small translation (d. dy d,), and small rotations 3X,c$, and 6, about the x, y, and z axes of the 
coordinate frame of F. Thus it becomes;  TF+dT~=T~(I+A~) (3.6) whereAFis a dl~erential motion matrix 
[7]. This ma­trix is referred to AF = [d, dy dZ~xby &#38;]F in the fol­lowing discussion. (2) Modification 
of face position: Translation of a face f along its x or y axes or rotation about its z axis do not affect 
the geometric information off. Smafl geometry change off from Tf to Tf+ ~f em be simplified t~ T,+ fl,= 
T, (Z+ A,)= T~(l+ [Oodz &#38; ~O]f) (3.7) 3.5 Constraints on Edge and Vertex The geometry change of a 
flat face causes further geome­try changes of edges and vertices surrounding the face. Edges and vertices 
of a polyhedral soiid correspond to in­tersection lines and points of the faces. Therefore, new ge­ometric 
information of them must satisfy the following constraints. (1) Constraints on edge: Transition of a 
straight line edge e along its x axis or rotation about the same axis do not affeet the geometry of e. 
Smail geometry change of e from Tt to T. + dTc with respezt to a ref­erence frame W can be simplified 
to; Tc+dTz =Tc (l+ AC)= T. (1+ [Odydz O by &#38; L) (3.8) Equations (3.5) must be satisfied for both 
the right side face~r and the left side face~l of e as follows; T; ~(~ (1+ A,)) = O T; (~ (1+ A.)) = 
T} T; (3.9)  Tfi (~ (1+ Ae)) = O T~ (r (1+A,)) =T~~Tfi [ where Tf, and Tfi denote the geometry of ~, 
and fl in W, respectively. (2) Constraints on vertex: Rotations of a vertex about its axes do not change 
its position. A smali position change of a vertex v from T, toT. +dT, with respect to W can be deseribed 
as; T,+dT, =T, (l+ AV)=T, (l+[dxdYd, OOO1,) (3.10) Equation (3.2) must be satisfied for three faces ~1,fz 
andf3 surrounding v as foilows; 381 Figure 6 Section view of an acm.al slot model.  T;. (~ (1+ Av))O=

terms of small variations are omitted, equa­tions and inequalities (3. 1) -(3.11) can be linearized. 
4. ACTUAL FEATURE MODEL The derivation of our actual feature model is based on fol­lowing geometric characteristics 
of machined surfaces fabricated by milling. (1) Each flat face is a basic result of a machining opera­tion. 
Hence, a machined surface corresponding to one flat face has a uniform geometric quality. Edges and vertices 
of the part are generated as an implicit result of face milling. (2) Geometric deviations of machined 
surfaces can be classified into following two types [13];  1) Small surface displacements and inclinations 
caused by false positioning of the workpiece and false adjustments of the machine tool; 2) Smatl, uniform, 
and high frequency geometric pat­terns scattered all over the surface caused by the tool shape and its 
motion. 4.1 Representation of Actual Feature Model Based on above considerations, an actual feature model 
M of a nominal feature F can be initiated as a regularized Boolean union and/or intersection of a set 
of plate like solids (pll, P12,.... pli, ...} with following properties (1) d, realizes a one-to-one 
correspondence to a compo­ (2) pli is bounded by two parallel flat faces mmed exter­nal boundary face 
(ebfi) and internal boundary face (ibfJ. (3) pli contains an actual surface portion gi corresponding 
tofi between ebfi and ibfi as closely as possible.  As shown in figure 6, surface displacement and/or 
inclina­tion can be represented by position and orientation of the plate. Effeets of the high frequency 
geometric pattern are evaluated by the thickness of the plate. An actual feature model M can be obtained 
according to following steps. (1) A transformation ,sTPtirepresenting the position of a plate pli of 
M in the reference coordinate frame W~ is obtained by slightly modifying the posilion of its cor­responding 
nominal face fi of F (cf. figure 7(1) and (2)). Based on transformation (3.7), sTPliis defined as sTfi 
(~+ [0Od, &#38; 6Y Olp/i) where sTfi denotes the nominal geometry Offi. (2) Geometric information of 
an external boundary face eb~.of ~li is derived by externally offsetting a flat sur­ face in the position 
given in (1) by dp~i~ where ~p~, represents the plate thickness. The external offset is equivalent to 
a translation of the flat surface along its z axis (see figure 7(3)). Therefore, the geometry of ebfi 
in Ws can be represented by a transformation sT@bfi= sTfi(~+ [0() d, + dP@ 6, 6YO]Pti).The poSi­tion 
of an internal boundary face ibfi can be similarly defined by rotating the flat surface about its x axis 
by z and further translating it along its z axis by dpJ2. 4.2 Sliced Portion of Actual Feature Model 
The actual featuremodel M is sliced by slicing faces as de­fined in section 1.2 (see also figure 1(4)), 
and a solid por­tion P(M) is obtained. Edges and vertices of p(M) are treated as intersection lines and 
points of the boundary faces of M and/or the slicing faces. Boundary faces of M are slight position and 
orientation variations of nominal faces. Therefore, any vertices of p(M) have their corre­sponding vertices 
of the nominal feature F with similar ge­ometry (SW F] and P(M1) in figure 1). Based on transfor­mation 
(3.10), the position of a vertex of p(M) is treated as a small position change of its corresponding nominal 
ver­tex. The vertex position must satisfy additional equation constraints (3. 11). d% (1) Nominal geometry

deriving an approximated tolerance zone 5. GEOMETRIC TOLERANCE ZONE In the following explanation, the 
geometnic information of a facefi belonging to a nominal feature F is defined with respect to the coordinate 
frame WFof F. The geometry of fi with respect to the frame Ws of the nominal solid S is thus derived 
by a matrix product STF FTfi where STF repre­sents the position of F in WS, and FTfi represents the ge­ 
ome~ Offi in WF. 5.1 Tolerance Zone Approximation As defined in equation (2.2), a tolerance zone TZ~ 
is ob­tained as a Boolean intersection of an offset solid of the extended feature EF(IFJ and another 
offset solid of c*(EF(lFg)), where IF~ is the correct geometric feature. The boundary of EF(IFJ is composed 
by a set of flat faces, straight line edges and vertices. Convex edges and vertices of EF(/FJ (or c (EF(lFJ)) 
are mapped to cylin­drical and spherical tmundary surfaces of the offset solid. Such curved surfaces 
are polyhedrized by a set of flat faces. The tolerance zone with the approximated boundary must contain 
the corr~t zone, so that any acceptable fea­tures are not missed. Figure 8 illustrates the steps for 
deriving an approxi­mated tolerance zone TZP1based on a position tolerance specification shown in figure 
1(l). As a preparation, some flat surfaces are attached to the bottom edges ez and eq of a nominal slot 
F1 (figure 8(l)). A correct position feature fFP1 is obtained by applying arbitrary dimension changes 
to F1. The position of the feature is further modified by a rigid-body transformation which maintains 
the feature in the correct position with respect to datum planes A and B (figure 8(2)). The positions 
of the attached surfaces are transformed accordingly so that they maintain proper con­tacts with their 
corresponding edges of IFP1. Instead of EF(lFPl) and c*(EF(/FP1)), the flat surfaces corresponding to 
the face elements of /FP1and surfaces attached to edges are offset by half of the tolerance value, to 
compose the approximate tolerance zone 7ZP1(figure 8(3)). 383 dr,+dj, =-AD dt] = d/3 Contact vertex w.

Surfaces An edge of EF(F) has one-to-one correspondence to an edge of F whose right and left side faces 
are also elements of F. A vertex of EF(F) similarly realizes one-to-one cor­respondence to a vertex of 
F, whose surroundingfaces are also elements of F. Fiat surfaces for the tolerance zone approximation 
are attached to such edges and vertices of F in the following way; (1) Surface attachment to edge: A 
set of fiat surfaces {afci ) is attached to a straight line edge e of F as they contain the right and 
left side faces of e in their lower side. A coordinate frame W@~jis assigned to afei witi h z axis along 
the normal vector of af,i and its origin somewhere on e. In addition, its x axis is along the direction 
of e. Wdci thus satisfies the conditions of the frame of the cxigee as explained in 3.2(2). (2) Surfaoe 
attachment to vertex: A set of flat surfaces (afvi ) is attached to a convex or concave vertex v as they 
contain the surrounding faces of v in their lower side. A coordinate frame W@i is assigned to @vi with 
its z axis along the normal vector of @viand its origin on v. W@ithus satisfies the conditions of the 
frame of the vertex v as explained in 3.2(3).  5.3 Treatment of ArtMtrary Dimension Change A correct 
geometzic feature is initiated as a parametrized feature F F(AD~;F) of the nominal feature F, where AD~ 
denotes arbitrary dimension changes. Parametric modifi­cation of a feature with dimensions only on two 
parallel faces can be achieved by appropriately translating the facesalong theirzaxes.Figure9 illustratesamodification 
of a slot F]. A dimension of 20 is speeified as a nominal distance of wall faces fl and f~. If the dimension 
is changed to 20 +AD, fl and ~3 are translated to satisfy the new di­mension. The amount of translations 
dfl of fl and dfl of f3 must satisfy a constraint dfi +dfi =-~. An additional constraintdfl =~ is imposed, 
to maintain the x and y axes of the coordinate frame WF1of F1 on the center plane of the slot. Figure 
10 Possible conlacts between a sliced actual feature model p(hl) and datum planes A, B, and C of an or&#38;red 
datum system. According to the parametric modification of F, the geometry of the flat surfaces attached 
to the edges and vertices of F must be updated so that they maintain the contact. Because of its definition 
in section 5.2(l), the co­ordinate frame Wti=iof a flat surface afCiattached to an edge e can be considered 
as a frame of e, also. The geom­etry of Ufei is thus updated by treating it as the edge e. Transformation(3.8) 
is used for updating. Equations (3.9) concerning the new geometry of e are applied as con­straints of 
the new geometry of af=iinstead. The geometry of flat surfaces attached to the vertices of F is similarly 
updated. 5.4 PositIon Reference of the Correct Geometric Feature A correctgcmmerncfeaturelFg is achieved 
by properlypo­ sitioning a parametrized feature PF(AD~; F). A correct form feature for a form toleranee 
can be arbitraryposi­tioned. Other correct orientation and position f ~tures must be properly positioned 
with respect to the datum. Based on our actual feature model, a single datum plane A is defined as a 
flat surface fitting the extemai boundary face ebf~ corresponding to A. The coordinate frame W#bfA of 
ebfA is used as a reference for positioning JFr An ordered datum system is composed by at most three 
mutually perpendicular datum pianes. Datum pianes A, B, and C shown in figure 10 can realize a face contact, 
a line contact, and a point contact with their corresponding 13Xti311idbOUIX@ faCeS.l%ey are ebfA, ebfB, 
and ebfc Of a sliced actuai feature model p(A4) in the figure. A specific eontaet condition is assumed 
where B contacts along an edge e~ of ebfB and C contacts at a vertex Vc of ebfc. Therefore, A, B, and 
C are positioned in the reference frame as they satisfy following condition (1) Datum A is the same as 
the extemai boundary face ebfA. (2) Based on transformation (3.7), datum B is realized as a smali position 
variation of the external boundary face ebfB. B is perpendicular toA and containseB. Equations (3. 1) 
and (3.5) are used to represent the constraints. (3) Datum C is a small position variation of the external

approximated tolerance zone TZ~is obtained by externally and internally offsetting flat surfaces corresponding 
to faces of the correct geomet­ric feature lFg. Fiat surfaces attached to the edges and ver­ tices of 
IFg are also externally offset. The external offset of a fiat surface is equivalent to the translation 
of the surface along its z axis by TJ2 where Tg denotes the tolerance value. The internal offset is achieved 
in a similar way. 5.6 Sliced Portion of Approximated Toierance Zone The approximated tolerance zone TZ8 
is divided by the slicing faces defined in section 1.2 (see also figure 1(4)), to obtain a solid portion 
p(TZ~). Edges and verdces of P(TQ are treated as intersection lines and points of surfaces composing 
the boundary of TZ~ and/or the slicing faces. Boundary surfaces of TZ~are small variations of the faces 
of the nominal feature F, or small variations of the surfaces attached to the edges and vertices of F. 
Therefore, any vertices of p(~g) have their corresponding nominal ver­ tices of F with similar geometry 
(see F] and p(7ZPl) in fig­ure 1). Based on transformation (3.10), the position of a vertex of p(7Z~) 
is treated as a small position change of its corresponding nominal vertex. The vertex position must satisfy 
additional equation constraints (3. 11). 6. Conditions OF ACCEPTABLE FEATURE Geometric information of 
P(M) of the actual feature modei M and p(~g) of the approximated tolerance zone TZ~ is algebraically 
represented by using the methods explained in section 4 and section 5. Spatial constraints imposed on 
acceptable features are interpreted in our study as a con­tainment condition of P(M) by p(TZ~). Figure 
1(7) illus­trates the condition with P(MI) and P(7ZP1).Because of the geometric similarity of p(M) and 
p(TZJ, the condition can be represented in terms of iinear inequalities. 6.1 Reiating Edges A concept 
of relating edges is used in our interpretation. As discussed in sections 4.2 and 5.6, edges of both 
p(M) and p(TZ8) are obtained as intersection lines of the com­mon slicing faces and/or boundary faces 
of M or TZe, which are small variations of nominal faces or surfaces at­tached to nominal edges and 
vertices. Therefore, if an edge mei of p(lkf) is given, a ~t of edges (tzej) of p(TZg) with similar geometry 
to mei can be retrieved. Such edges are called relating edges of me,. For example, edges tze31and (zeszof 
p(7ZPl) in figure 1(6) are relating edges of an edge me3 of p(M1) in figure 1(5). Wi q # lZ~j <.: Z

(tzej] of me, is as fol­lows; (1) If ~i corresponds to an intersection line of two slic­ing faces, (zej 
is an edge corresponding to an inter­sedon line of the same faces. (2) If mei corresponds to an intersection 
line of one slic­ing face sf and one boundary face of p(M) obtained by offsetting a nominal face nf, 
tzej is an edge corre­sponding to an intersection line of sf and one bound­ary face of p(7Z~) obtained 
by offsetting nf. (3) If mei corresponds to an intersection line of two boundary faces of p(M) obtained 
by offsetting two nominal faces nfl and nfz, tze, is an edge correspond­ing to an intersection line of 
two boundary faces of P(mg). Such faces are;  (3. 1) Two faces obtained by offsetting nfl and ~2. (3.2) 
A face obtained by offsetting n~l or nf2, and an­other face obtained by externally offsetting a surface 
attached to an edge shared by nfl and nf2. (3.3) Two faces obtained by extemaliy offsetting two surfaces 
attached to an edge shared by nfl and nf2. Above mentioned example corresponds to the case (3.2). 6.2 
Spatiai Containment Condition An algebraic interpretation of the containment condition was initiated 
by Turner [16], which is applicable to two dimensional figures with similar shape. Our interpretation 
introduced below is an extension of his method for repre­senting the spatial containment condition. Containment 
condition of P(M) by p(lZ~) is a conjunc­ tion of following condition 1 and condition 2. Condltlon 1: 
Every edge mei of P(M) and its relating edges {tzej] of p(TZg) satisfy one of following conditions; (1) 
If mei is a convex edge, two end vertices rnsvi and ~evi of mei must be below or on the right and left 
side faces of rzej (figure 1l(l)). Use in­equality (3.4) to represent the condition. (2) If mei is a 
concave edge, two end vertices (zsvj and tzevj of tzejmust be above or on the right and left side faces 
of ~i (figure 11(2)). Use in­equality(3.3) torepresentthecondition.  Condition 2: Every convex vertex 
mviof p(M) derived as a small position change of a nominal vertex vk, must be below or on some boundary 
faces of p(TZ8).Such faces are obtained by externally offset­ting flat surfaces attached to v~.Use inequality 
(3.4) to representthe condition. 7. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, a representation of the allowed 
variation of acceptable features in geometric tolerancing is proposed. An actual feature model is representedbased 
on geometric characteristicsof machined surfaces. The spatial constraint imposedon theacceptablefeatureis 
interpretedin termsof linear inequalities based on the polyhedral approximation of the tolerance zone 
boundary, Thispaperdiscussedsofaronly theoreticalaspectsof the method. An implementation of the system 
and evalua­tion of its applicability for analyzing machine parts with complex tolerance specifications 
are required.In particular, following points have to be addressed in our future re­search WOrk; (1) Obtained 
results are applicable to sole polyhedral parts. Proper polyhedral approximations enable to apply the 
method on features with curved surfaces. (2) Types of actual feature models must be extended so that 
geometric characteristics of actual surfaces gen­eratedby otherfabricationmethodscanbeevaluated. (3) 
Extension of the method for treating the contact of two actual features is needed for analyzing the devia­tion 
stack-up in assemblies.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research work was financially supported by grants from
