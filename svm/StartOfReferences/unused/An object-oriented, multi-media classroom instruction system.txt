And third, the avadable messagmg system does not provide interactive access to previous messages to either 
the student or the instructor. The direct application of state-of-the-art workstation technology to some 
of these problems is apparent. It takes only the addition of appropriate (but very spe­ cialized) device 
controllers for the various media hard­ware to make the automation of this entire process possible. Indeed, 
such an automated multimedia plat­form goes well beyond solving the deficiencies described above and, 
in fact, provides a significant increase in functionality for both instructors and trainees. Architecture 
of the ECS System A conceptual view of the electronic classroom in which the ECS software will be used 
is presented in Figure 1. Each classroom typically consists of an instructor workstation, several student 
workstations, and a cen­tral projection screen. Each room is also equipped with a variety of video and 
audio hardware devices to sup­port the needs of the general curriculum and specific lesson objectives. 
The software portion of the ECS system is composed of five primary modules: the Programmed Lesson Plan­ner 
(PLP), the Message module, the Quiz module, the Login module and the Notes module. All the pro­rams associated 
with these modules are written in C for display in a X-Windows environment. The strongly object-oriented 
nature of the X-Windows system has been adopted as the general development pattern, as well. This promotes 
a level of consistency in the soft­w~e and makea X-Windows somewhat easier to work w]th. The instructor 
and a.tudent workstations access the dif­ ferent modules within the ECS environment throu h a hierarchical 
menu-based interface, The bulk of the f S software remdes on the instructor workstat~on. T%e PLP, Message, 
QUIZ, Logm and Notes modules all re­quire the authorization and/or intervention of the in­st ructor. 
The instructor workstation is also responsible for providin access to the various multimedia hard­ware 
availa.d e in the room. Student workstations we prnnardy chents used to dwplay mformatlon, or receive 
limited keyboard input from the student. All of these workstations, in addition to their basic workstation 
dis­play roles, function as displays for real-time bitmap displays generated externally (ss in radar 
scope simu­ lations), The Login module provides the ECS environment with basic classroom management features 
and some level of security. It reflects the unique nature of the ECS training environment, in which classes 
(groups) have long term stability while the classroom itself is used by several groups over time. This 
requires that the system protect one class from another in the sense of guard­ing against intermin~ling 
course work, allowed partici­pants, and multimedia information between classes. The PLP module is used 
for the creation and delivery of electronic lemons called Programmed Lesson Plans. The PLP module consists 
of two applications, a spe­cialized editor (PLPEDIT) that is used to create the lessons and an application 
that allows the delivery of the lesson (PLPRUN). The Notes module allows an instructor to view supple­mental 
information associated with predefine topic(s) or location(s) in the lesson plan. This is the primary 
source of lesson continuity material. The Quiz module consists of two parts, a Quiz Moni­toring System 
(QMS) and a Review Question System (RQS). The RQS allows the instructor to broadcast re­view questions 
to the class in order to test the students understanding of concepts. The QMS provides the in­structor 
with irryned~ate feedback about the students responses, allowing h~m to review and momtor student progress 
during the course of a lesson. The Mess e module provides a communication facil­ity for botT instructor 
and students. The instructor is allowed to communicate individually with a student or to broadcast messages 
to all students. Students are constrained to initiate communication only with the in­structor. The Mesage 
module provides both a formal (e.g. mail and announce) and an informal (e.g. talk) pattern of communication.
