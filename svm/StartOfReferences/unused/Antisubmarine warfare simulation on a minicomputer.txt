has long been considered an effective technique in the area of military applica- tions, especially in 
systems analysis and in personnel training programs. In this study, a simulation model designated as 
SEASIM (Surface Escort Antisubmarine Warfare Simulation) was developed to simulate an antisubmarine warfare 
engagement between surface escorts and an enemy submarine. The model development was sponsored by the 
Surface Sonar Department of the Naval Underwater Systems Center, New London, Connecticut. The original 
model was developed to run on a desktop minicomputer to take advantage of its easy accessibility) real-time 
graphics capability, interactive special features, and low costs. The simulation models specifically 
the acoustic detection of a submarine by a destroyer and the attack on the submarine by a torpedo-carrying 
helicopter. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Overview An antisubmarine warfare system) like any other war= fare system) 
is complex and extremely difficult to study and analyze. The many variables and parameters such as the 
number and type of ships involved) interac- tion between ships) long distances) time of the year and 
day, sun, wind, currents) shipping noise, and other con- stantly changing ocean environmental factors 
make mathematical modeling extremely difficult. Labora-tory experiments or real-life exercises are time-con-suming 
and costly; often they are prohibitive. Hence, simulation is the most effective technique for studying 
these system s. SEASIM is a computer simulation of a hypothetical war- time engagement between surface 
escorts (destroyers) and an enemy submarine. The fundamental model was developed in 1980 and has since 
been refined and expanded. The simulation model was designed to analyze surface- ship antisubmarine warfare 
(ASW) in the 1990 to 2000 time frame; the specific goal was to quantify sonar sys- tem performance, identify 
shortfalls, and recommend technological improvements. Consequently, the input and output modules of SEASIM 
were designed to facili- tate the variation of sonar parameters and the collec- tion of statistical data 
on escort effectiveness in detecting, classifying, localizing, and attacking the enemy submarine. Two 
different variants of the SEASIM model were developed, The single=escort model simulates an inter- action 
between one surface ship and an evading enemy submarine. The multi=escort model simulates two or three 
surface ships conducting ASW against one enemy submarine, The multi=escort model can deal with the additional 
problems associated with multiple=ship ASW such as communications delay and mutual interference. In addition) 
both models extensively simulate the prose- cution of long-range sonar contacts by torpedo-carrying Light 
Airborne Multipurpose System (LAMPS) heli-copters, The desktop minicomputer was selected as a major tool 
for the analysis for a number of reasons. First, the minicomputer does have some excellent features which 
cannot be found on a large computer. The real-time graphics capability on the CRT gives the analyst a 
vis- ual display of the progress of the engagement. This is invaluable in analyzing tactics and often 
in understand- ing the statistical results. Second, the model is written in BASIC, a language that is 
easily understood and mod- ified. Third) the minicomputer is accessible in many places: classroom, office, 
laboratory, and conference room. Also) the minicomputer can easily be placed onboard ships. Because the 
program itself is stored on a cassette tape) it can be readily transported and used. 1.2 Background and 
Issues The objective of surface-ship antisubmarine warfare is to detect the enemy submarine at long distances 
and to 81CH1709-5/81/0000-005~00.75 Q 1981 IEEE 54 J.M. ARRIGAN and D.M. SHAO attack with torpedo-carrying 
aircraft. The destroyer itself would prefer to stay out of range of the subma- rine's weapons. The attacking 
aircraft in SEASIM is the LAMPS helicopter, which is embarked on the destroyer. The usual scenario is 
that the destroyer detects the submarine on a particular bearing. Although a bearing to the target is 
known, range usually is only estimated. The LAMPS consequently is launched and flies out on the line 
of bearing. It drops acoustic sensors and attempts to detect and localize the submarine on these sensors 
so that he can attack with a torpedo. Estimates of likely ranges can be made by studying the theoretical 
sound propagation paths for the environ-ment in which the destroyer is operating. The propagation of 
sound in the ocean can follow a number of interesting and unexpected paths. The sound emitted by a submarine 
may be heard by another ship for a range of a few miles if the sound travels along the surface duct. 
The sound can also travel down into the ocean and bounce off the ocean floor back to the sur-face. In 
certain situations, the sound path can bend and converge back to the surface at a long distance. Con-sequently, 
a destroyer may be able to hear a submarine if they are within I0 miles of each other or if they are 
separated by 30 to 35 nautical miles. The destroyer would not, however, be able to hear the submarine 
if they were separated by I0 to 30 nautical miles. Fig-ure I shows these various sound ray paths. VELOCITY~

1 The SEASIM program addresses the following three basic issues: I. Detection and Classification Performance. 
Early detection of a submarine is important for successful ASW operations; therefore, a primary objective 
of SEASIM is to quantify the expected detection performance against enemy threats. Detection is quantified 
in terms of probability of detecting, range of detection and percent of time detection is held after 
initial detection. Once a signal is detected, it must be classified. The signal could emanate from an 
enemy submarine, a merchant ship, marine life, or from a number of other sources. The classification 
process is modeled and the probability of correctly classifying a detected signal and the time between 
detection and classification are recorded. 2. Localization Capabilities and Techniques. Localization, 
the determination of the posi-tion of a contact with sufficient accuracy to prosecute, is one of the 
most pressing prob- lems in passive ASW, It is especially crucial to surface ASW operations, which rely 
heavily on the use of aircraft to prosecute contacts gained initially by destroyers and frigates. Several 
localization techniques are being developed for implementation on sur-face ASW units. Some are single-platform 
techniques, while others (e.g., crossfixing) require two or more ships. The various local- ization techniques 
have different advantages and disadvantages that relate to the opera- tional and environmental settings 
in which they are applied. The influence of sensor capabilities on these techniques can be ana-lyzed 
using SEASIM. 3. Tactics. Because the only information that the escort may have on the submarine is a 
bearing, the escorts must use appropriate tactics to maintain sonar contact, to keep the threat at a 
distance, and to localize the target for LAMPS helicopter attack. The continuous CRT display of the progress 
of each simulation run enables the analyst to study tactics as the scenario evolves and to develop follow-up 
tactics that depend on a series of previous moves.  1.3 Data Base One of the first tasks in preparing 
the simulation was to perform the research for three data books that contain most of the inputs for SEASIM. 
An environmental data book contains environmental-acoustic data for winter and summer seasons in six 
ocean environments. Propagation-loss curves were generated for a number of frequencies for numerous target-sensor 
depth combina- tions. These curves are stored on magnetic tape for use by the SEASIM model. Additional 
curves can be gener- ated if SEASIM is to be used in a different type of ocean environment than the ones 
available. No envi- ronmental data must be entered into the simulation other than the choice of ocean 
and the season of the year. A baseline systems data book describes in detail the systems installed on 
the surface escorts. Data on all applicable sonar systems were collected and docu-mented. Baseline data 
for all sonar parameters are automatically initialized in the program. Consequently, the analyst does 
not have to collect and enter numerous data every time the program is used. (Sonar param- eters may be 
changed before running the model if desired.) A threat data book contains extensive information on the 
projected enemy submarines. Pertinent threat acoustic data are initialized in the program. Other threat 
data such as course, speed, depth, and estimated counterdetection range are inputs. l .# Inputs The program 
begins with a carefully constructed sec-tion of interactive prompted inputs. Default values are initialized 
in the program for all inputs. The inclusion of default values for all inputs greatly simplifies the 
use of the program, and, more impor-tantly, increases the accuracy of inputs. Because the program was 
specifically designed for a sensitivity analysis on sensor parameter variations, the analyst can easily 
vary the default inputs by responding to prompted questions. The operator has only to vary a few values 
rather than enter many values. ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE SIMULATION Oft A MINICOHPUTER 1.5 Geometry The 
geometry for the one-on-one model is derived from a scenario in which a surface escort is directed to 
locate and track a submarine that was detected by intelligence. In the model, the escort is placed at 
the lower left (southwest) corner of the engagement area and the submarine is at the upper right (northeast) 
corner. They start on closing courses, 100 nautical miles apart. The initial position and course of the 
sub- marine are randomly varied on each run to avoid repeti- tion. The multiship geometry can describe 
a number of dif- ferent scenarios. For example, two or three surface ships, escorting an aircraft carrier, 
are conducting an ASW search. They are positioned in a screen approxi-mately 30 nautical miles ahead 
of the aircraft carrier. The mission of the enemy submarine, which is ahead of the group, is to penetrate 
the screen and attack the carrier. 1.6 Output SEASIM output consists of five parts, any or all of which 
can be printed at the end of a run. The output was specifically designed to aid the analyst in studying 
the relationship of detection, classification, localiza-tion, and attack statistics to changes in inputs. 
The five parts of the output are: 1. Input summary. To identify adequately the inputs of a run, all manual 
inputs and all sonar parameters are printed. (Most inputs in the input summary shown in Figure 2 have 
been replaced by an asterisk so that the fig- ure will not be classified.) 2. Statistical summary. Statistics 
are collected and printed for detection, classification, localization, attack, and counterdetection, 
as in Figure 3. 3. Histograms. A number of histograms of range and time distributions are also printed. 
Figure 4 is one example. A matrix of histo- gram values is also printed so that the ana-lyst does not 
have to read values from the histogram.  4. Prop-loss curves. Propagation-loss curves (see Figure 5) 
can be plotted for all frequen- cies and depth combinations used in the run. 5. Track plots. The plot 
showing escort and submarine tracks as well as sonobuoy loca-tions can be printed, as shown in Figure 
6. This is especially valuable for analyzing tac- tics. NOTE: All sample output is not from the same 
run. One version of SEASIM stores all output on disk. Thus, a data base is built which can be analyzed 
extensively using any of the many statistical packages available for computer analysis. Rim | 17 --INPUT

on an HP 9g~SB desktop calculator with IgTK of memory. The model was writ-ten in HP Extended BASIC. The 
model exceeds the core limitations of the HP 9g~SB and is executed in three segments that link automatically. 
The first seg- ment is the input module. Once the inputs are com-pleted, the simulation segment is linked 
into core. At the end of the simulation run, the summary section is linked into core to print the output. 
Because the entire simulation section fits in core, no coding has to be linked into core during the execution 
of the simulation algorithm. 5EASIM later was translated into FORTRAN and installed on a VAX ll/Tg0. 
The VAX version was cali-brated with the HP version. SEASIM has also been installed on a CDC 6600. Testing 
runs can be cali-brated and repeated by controlling the initial random seed. All these versions provide 
identical output for a given set of inputs.  56 J.M. ARRIGAN and D.rl. SHAO RUN # 33 --STRTISTICFILPERFORMFIHCE

cost savings. The daily cost of leasing the HP 98#5 was about Sty0, a fraction of the daily cost of the 
larger machines. Also, since BASIC does not require compilation after programming changes, consid-erable 
time is saved on the writing and debugging stages of building the model. On some heavily used time-sharing 
systems, compilation is painfully slow. Sample runs were made overnight at no cost Since the HP 9845 
model dumps the track plot of each trial and prints the random number that begins each trial, the programmer 
can repeat any trial that needs further analysis and can trace variables during the repeat trial. 4[..1

requires two days to com- plete. Such slowness of execution is prohibitive for generating analysis runs. 
The VAX 11/780 version, on the other hand, runs 200 times as fast as the liP version, completing a trial 
in less than two seconds and a set of 3200 trials in approximately one and one-half hours. The VAX ver-sion 
has been coded to load runs for overnight batch execution. Hundreds of different runs can be com-pleted 
automatically over a weekend. Data generated by VAX runs are also stored on a disk for future com-puter 
analysis of the data. 2. MODEL ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION 2.1 Overview SEASIM focuses on long-range (greater 
than five nauti- cal miles) detection and prosecution. Therefore, each scenario begins with the target 
beyond escort maximum detection range on a closing course. At each time step, acoustic signal excess 
(SE) is computed, and if the SE meets specified criteria (e.g., SE is greater than zero for five consecutive 
time steps), a detection is called. At that point, the detecting unit maneuvers to conduct classification 
and localization procedures. If localiza- tion is achieved, an attack is launched. If contact is lost, 
the unit returns to its search plan. If the submarine comes within counterdetection range of an escort, 
the submarine evades, returning to its ori- ginal course after an appropriate delay. Otherwise, it continues 
on course until it is attacked or it reaches its objective. Either event terminates the run. Functional 
characteristics of the detection, classifica- tion, localization, and attack modules of SEASIM are discussed 
in the following sections. Tactics for SEASIM were drawn from approved naval publications and from fleet 
experience. 2,2 Detection The passive sonar detection criterion is that signal excess is greater than 
zero for five consecutive time steps (five minutes). Signal excess is computed using the formula below 
which contains both deterministic components and a random component: SE = SL = [(AN -DI)(~)SN] -RD - 
DL -PL + B where SL = target source level, AN = ambient noise, DI --array directivity index, SN = escort 
self-noise, RD = recognition differential, DL --deviation loss, PL = propagation loss, B = B (t) = a 
time-dependent random fluctua- tion and (~ : symbol for power addition. The fluctuating term, B(t), represents 
the net result of all short-term random changes in SE. Random fluctua- tions in SE are assumed to be 
governed by the Poisson distribution and to have a Gaussian amplitude distribu- tion. Random SE components 
as a function of time are calculated for the environment and for each frequency. Both the environmental 
and frequency-dependent com- ponents are added to the deterministic component for each frequency every 
time SE is computed. The remaining (deterministic) terms of the passive sig- nal-excess equation are 
a function of many variables including frequency, range, target or escort speed, and target bearing. 
Propagation-loss files are entered via magnetic tape. Tables of other parameters such as ambient noise 
and directivity index are included in the program and appropriate values selected automatically based 
on input decisions. Active detection is based on a criterion similar to that described for the passive 
case.  2.3 Classification Passive classification is called if a submarine-like sig- nal is held for 
a specific duration. After initial detec- tion, the destroyer will maneuver to ensure that the signal 
is not from own ship. Following this maneuver, the unit commences localization procedures. When a classification 
is called, the LAMPS helicopter is alerted. When the alert time has passed, the LAMPS helicopter may 
be launched either on a line of bearing search or to a specific bearing and range if sufficient information 
is available. If contact is lost, the ASW 58 J.M. ARRIGAN and D.H. SHAO unit will re1:urn to its search 
plan. The LAMPS heli-copter returns to the escort if detection is lost for 15 minutes. 2.4 Localization 
Localization is defined as determining target position with sufficient accuracy to prosecute with the 
LAMPS helicopter. Initially, the localization process involves making use of a series of clues to arrive 
at a gross range estimate. Contact bearing rate is one of the best clues available for estimating target 
range. A high bearing rate strongly indicates a short-range target (less than five nautical miles) requiring 
immediate action. Conversely, if the bearing rate is low and long-range detections are likely, the target 
may be in a converg-ence zone. In this case, the escort attempts to keep the contact in the convergence 
zone and vector the LAMPS helicopter to the contact bearing. If the target bearing rate is between the 
high and low limits) the target is assumed to be in the intermediate range zone (five nautical miles 
to the convergence zone). In cases where more than one escort is available) local- ization may be achieved 
by crossfixing) i.e., plotting simultaneous target lines of bearing from both escorts. Crossfix information 
(if available) would supplement or even override other localization solutions) depending on the relative 
accuracy and confidence assigned to the sources. 2.5 Attack The baseline ASW units being studied carry 
the LAMPS helicopter; it is assumed that the primary surface ASW attack tactic is to conduct a LAMPS 
attack at the max- imum practicable range. Therefore, the model includes an extensive LAMPS module that 
simulates LAMPS launch, transit) and search using various tactics and sonobuoy patterns as required by 
the situation. LAMPS attacks if the target is reacquired. The simulation ter- minates following an attack 
by the LAMPS. 3. APPLICATIONS SEASIM was developed primarily as a tool to study the long-range ASW systems 
capability of 1990 to 2000 time-frame surface escorts; however, the program can be put to many other 
applications after minor modifica- tions.  3.1 Training SEASIM has been modified recently for a demonstration 
of its capability as a training tool for sonar supervisors and for commanding officers. Instead of having 
a sub- marine track appear on the CRT, the sonar bearings, frequency, and radar contacts are printed. 
The oper- ator then makes decisions about escort course and speed, launching and retrieving LAMPS, sonobuoy 
pat- terns, etc. The special function keys are used to enter decisions. 3.2 Antisurface Warfare SEASIM, 
with appropriate modifications and data col- lection, has been used to analyze an encounter between an 
American submarine and an enemy surface ship. Improvements in threat capabilities can be evaluated for 
their tactical impact. Probabilities for detection, classification, localization, counterdetection, and 
break-contact can be evaluated. 3.3 Tactical Development SEASIM is constructed so that escort, aircraft, 
and sub- marine tactics can be readily analyzed from statistical results and also by visual monitoring 
of the engagement on the CRT. Single-unit and battle-group tactics can be evaluated at a fraction of 
the cost of evaluating them at sea, and the results are available much more quickly. 3.4 Advanced Platforms 
Work has begun on the use of SEASIM to study the effectiveness of a fast hydrofoil in an ASW screen. 
The many-on-one version can be used to study the advan- tages of high speed) especially in cases involving 
cross- fix.  3.5 Mobile Surveillance SEASIM can be expanded in scale to allow analyses of towed surveillance 
systems in a range of areas and environments. By increasing the number of targets in the model, the problems 
of contact classification and management could be studied for these systems. 3.6 Summary SEASIM is 
a highly realistic ASW model operating on two very different types of computer. One produces large amounts 
of statistical output very quickly. The other allows the operator to observe and monitor the progress 
of the simulated ASW engagement and, if desired, to control the engagement. Both models use the same 
algorithms. SEASIM can be adapted quickly and accurately to dif- ferent applications by adding coding 
to handle new tac- tics, additional systems and escorts, additional data collection and statistical analysis, 
and different output. The documented data base contained in the data books and initialized in SEASIM 
is an invaluable aid in using the model. The usefulness of the simulation results is dependent on input 
accuracy. The availability of a library of propagation-loss curves on magnetic tape further enhances 
the versatility of SEASIM.
