Sam Houston State University to install an Intelligent Universal Student Advisor (IUA) which will be 
accessible to the student boa'3 via the University LAN. The IUA is very versatile and can be used by 
any department. Appropriate advisors are given privilege to maintain current advising information for 
their respective departments. The IUA is designed to answer many of the students' questions. When fully 
implemented, the IUA will be capable of handling all of the conmlon advising functions. Only exceptions 
and ~lcascs will require faculty assistance in the advising process. The required use of the IUA should 
result in better and more consistent advice for the students while requiring less faculty resources. 
 INTRODUCTION Since many universities are encountering budget problems, university faculty are being 
given more and more responsibilities. Although emotionally rewarding, student advising is generally one 
of the responsibilities that is neglected by faculty as "more important" responsibilities, such as research, 
receive more emphasis. At Sam Houston State University, a predominantly teaching university, the administration 
expects many of "Permission to make digital/hard copy of all or part of this material without fee is

research, advise students, and various other service activities. In an effort to retain a higher number 
of students, the administration has demanded that faculty do a better job of advising students. Student 
advising problems also occur because many students enroll without seeking advice and/or having read the 
university catalog. These problems prompted a decision to implement a universal advising system that 
performs all the preliminary advising functions. When it is fully implemented, it will provide all the 
direction that a student will need. It also provides for the special cases in which students are transferring 
credit for courses taken elsewhere into the university, as well as allowing a facul.ty advisor to tailor 
a degree advising sheet for special cases. The full system should be implemented in the Computer Science 
Department shortly. It is anticipated that many other departments will also utilize the UIA after its 
beta test. It is very flexible; hence, very easily utilized in any department. JUSTIFICATION The administration 
at Sam Houston State University has decided to concentrate efforts aimed at retaining students. The administration, 
therefore, expects each department to implement an advising system. All faculty are expected to teach 
12 hours per semester, perform research, mentor students, and advise as well as perform university, service. 
As time goes on, faculty find that the Universi .ty expects them to allocate more of their time to research. 
Unfortunately, this occurs at the expense of students seeking advise. Many times students are rushed 
through the advising process without receiving any written suggestions for succeeding semesters. This 
method is not acceptable to students since most of them do not like to be required to be advised every 
semester. Comnmting students, especially, do not like mandatory advising every semester. Another problem 
the university encounters is that many students never seek advice since it is not mandatory to do so. 
They simply take courses that fit nicely into their schedule without worrying whether they have completed 
the proper prerequisites. Needless to say, it is very frustrating for a faculty member teaching a junior 
level course to suddenly discover that one-fourth to one-third of his/her class does not have the proper 
prerequisites. In this day of scant numbers of Computer Science majors, one can hardly request this portion 
of the students to drop. It can be argued that a student mature enough to be enrolled in college courses 
should be able to read the catalog and follow the prescribed plan for his/her degree. However, this method 
hasn't worked. For whatever reason, students need more guidance. In fact, in a recent survey, students 
across the U.S. listed inadequate advising as one of the major frustrations they encounter [6]. Nontraditional 
students (those over 25) also reported that one of the greatest hindrances to attaining a degree was 
academic advising I31. At many universities, students are demanding changes in the advising process [5 
I. It seems that faculty must find a way to allocate their time in such a way that the advising needs 
of students are met. It was felt that an Intelligent Universal Advisor (IUA) should be made available 
to students via the LAN so that students can access it from any Computer on the network. Students with 
special problems, can utilize the IUA system then seek help with exceptions from a faculty member. Commuting 
students have access to advice that otherwise might not be available due to conflicting schedules of 
the faculty advisor and the student. If properly utilized by both the students and the faculty, the IUA 
solves many of the advising problems. Students will now have access to advising any hour of the day. 
Since the IUA will be sufficient for many students, the faculty advisors will be required to advise smaller 
numbers of students. For the students with special requirements, the faculty advisor needs to work through 
details only once in which a four-year plan would be prepared. From hence forward, the student can get 
updates directly from the IUA_ IMPLEMENTATION The Intelligent Universal Advisor (IUA) was implemented 
using Microsoft Access. The database consists of many tables: a table of Colleges (Arts and Sciences, 
Business, Education, etc.), table of departments, table of degrees, a course inventory table, table of 
prerequisites, table of equivalencies, and tables for each degree, track, and minor for each department. 
A representative for each College and Department is given "write privileges" to appropriate tables in 
the database. The College representative must enter the college requirements. The department representative 
is required to enter all the requirements for each degree, track, and minor the respective department 
offers. These a&#38;ninistrative users are provided with a generic template via a GUI. The template allow.s 
the user to input information into the ~'stem as well as copy information previously entered by. the 
college or department and then make revisions. This greatly reduces the amount of input needed; however, 
it stills allows for tailoring of a degree. Man)' departments negotiate with their respective College 
concerning College requirements. For instance, a bachelor of science degree may require two courses of 
Biology or two courses of Geology, whereas a bachelor of arts degree may allow one course in Biology 
and one course in Geology', or two courses in Biology, or two courses in Geology to complete the College's 
science requirement. The template allows the user to easily enter these conjunctions and disjunctions." 
For instance, in the example above, the bachelor of science degree may require (Biology. 101 and Biology 
102) or (Geology 101 and Geology 102). The GUI template provides straightforward utilities for the user 
to input this type of information. The ability to input this information instead of having it "hard coded" 
into the system as in [2,5] makes the IUA more flexible and easier to use than other computerized advisors 
being utilized today. This feature also allows the department complete control over the requirements 
and their being input correctly in a timely fashion instead of relying on an overworked administrative 
staff person to maintain the currency of the requirements across campus. Each time the requirements of 
a degree are altered, the system date is recorded. Therefore, the ILIA has the requirements of many different 
catalogs available. At Sam Houston State University, the catalog changes approximately every two years. 
Students are required to complete the requirements of the catalog in effect when the), first enrolled, 
or any catalog thereafter. By recording the system date, it is vet3, easy to determine the appropriate 
catalog for each student. Texas supports the electronic transfer of student transcripts between universities 
as students move about the state, thus, a standard format for transcripts has been adopted. This facilitates 
the interfacing of the IUA with Sam Houston State University student transcript information. The IUA 
is user friendlier and easier to use than the advising implementations discussed in [2,5] since it is 
not necessary for the student to provide any information concerning courses completed. However, a 106 
 utility is provided by which a student may enter his/her transcript information into the IUA. This is 
necessau' in order to make the IUA useful for students transferring from outside the state of Texas since 
occasionally the student is allowed to enroll before the administration has adequate time to input the 
student's transcript information. UTILIZING THE SYSTEM The IUA system will be initially made available 
to Computer Science students at Sam Houston State University. Via a GUI, a student enters his/her student 
id. Using this information, the IUA ~,stem logs into the administrative computer and downloads the student's 
transcript. A new student is provided with a list of possible degrees from which to choose and is allowed 
to choose the department and the type of degree, BS, BA, etc., that he/she desires, If the degree chosen 
by. the student requires a minor, then the student is asked to input his/her preference. Using the student's 
transcript and the degree requirements, the IUA prepares an advising sheet for the student. This sheet 
is presented in categories as prescribed ~ the department when the requirements were entered. For example, 
in figure I, the categories are: criterion I -criterion VII, major, and minor. Notice that the left colmnn 
of the sheet lists the courses yet to be completed in each category while the right hand side of the 
sheet lists the courses completed in each category.. The student will be given the option to print the 
advising sheet. In many cases, this sheet will contain all the necessary information needed by a student 
to successfully complete his/her degree. The student also has the option of printing a prerequisite form. 
This form lists the courses on his/her advising sheet that are not yet completed along with the prerequisites 
for each of these courses. It is anticipated that.this document will alleviate the problem of students 
enrolling in courses for which the3' have not completed the proper prerequisites. There do exist some 
cases where the advisory sheet is not sufficient. For instance, a student in Computer Science may have 
worked as a progranmmr for 10 years before completing his/her degree. In this case, the faculty advisor 
may need to alter the requirements for the student. For example, the faculty advisor may decide it is 
not necessary that the student should take Programming I and Programming II. The faculty advisor will 
have "write privileges" to the IUA to alter the requirements for the student. When the alterations are 
completed, the changes will be saved so that when the student desires an updated advisory sheet, he/she 
can obtain one directly from the IUA without any intervention from the faculty advisor. Most ~.'stetr~. 
do not allow for this individualized tailoring of the degree requirements. The exceptionsf~are handled 
with extra paperwork sent to administration. In the case of transfer students, the student proceeds with 
the normal process of obtaining an ackisory sheet from the 1UA. The student then meets With the faculty 
advisor who approves/disapproves any or all the transfer courses as well as the requirements the transfer 
courses satisfy. The IUA learns from tliis information. The next time a transfer student who has completed 
any of these courses seeks advise from the IUA, the IUA will inform the student that he/she may be able 
to use some of his/her transfer courses to satisfy some of the requirements and will suggest that he/she 
meet with a faculty advisor. When the student meets with the faculty advisor, the IUA suggests transfer 
equivalencies, based on previous equivalencies that have been learned,, and allows the faculty advisor 
to accept or refuse each suggestion. The Intelligent aspect of the IUA allows for uniformity in advising 
students, especially if more than one faculty is responsible for advising. Again,. this aspect of the 
advisor is an enhancement to systems currently being used. Many universities have equivalency, agreements 
among feeder schools [4]. But these equivalencies are constantly changing and the database of equivalencies, 
maintained by the University Administration, never seems to reflect the most current changes. In general, 
these equivalency databases become a nightmare after only a few short months. The equivalencies must 
be constantly renegotiated as course content changes at either campus involved. This involves a tremendous 
amount of paperwork, It also suggests that the equivalency database is never current for all universities 
involved in the system. However, most advising systems prepare degree plans assuming the information 
in the equivalency database is current. This can be frustrating to the student and the faculty advisor 
since the equivalency database is "hard ceded" into the system and yet more paperwork is required to 
override its results. By allowing the Department Advisor "write privileges", he/she can accept or deny 
all suggested eqnivalencies. If necessary, the faculty advisor can require the student to present documented 
evidence as to the content of each transfer course before making a decision. Therefore, the advising 
sheet is prepared correctly the first time resulting in less frustration and time for the student and 
faculty advisor alike. By inputting the equivalen¢ies on an as needed basis, the data stored will be 
greatly reduced. The advising systems that implement equivalency databases from feeder schools [4] maintain 
a complete inventory of course 107 equivalencies from each feeder school. Much of this information 
is never used and the manpower and paperwork needed to maintain the database is enormous. Because of 
the generic design of the IUA s3'stem, students may also use it to help them decide the shortest route 
to graduation. The student may query the IUA to apply his/her transcript to many different degree combinations 
and report the result of each. For an undecided major, this method may be desirable in helping the student 
decide upon a major. ARGUMENTS AGAINST COMPUTERIZED ADVISING SYSTEMS It could be argued that an advising 
system such as the IUA is useful only to students who want advice and those students are probably alrea~, 
seeking advice from a faculty member. Therefore, the system is not going to solve the problem of students 
who do not seek advice, whether it be from a faculty member or the catalog. However, it is surprising 
to note that man3" students are too intimidated to seek advice from a faculty member 16]. The IUA could 
be just the right tool for these students. It is also interesting to note that many times students are 
not comfortable with faculty advisors since faculty ad~4sors tend to become too personal in their advice 
[ 1 ]. Again, the IUA is a solution to this problem. CONCLUSIONS The ILIA solves ninny problems of the 
current advising systems. It is available 24 hours a day. It can resolve many of the advising issues 
that concern students; i.e., "Which courses should I takeT';" Of the courses that I have taken, which 
criteria do they satisfyT'; "What prerequisites are required for the courses I need to take?". It can 
also be used to answer the "what if' questions that students often ask; i.e., "If I changed majors, what 
courses would I need for the new requirements?"; "If I changed minors, what courses would I need for 
the new requirements?"; "Based on the courses that I have taken, what major could I complete the quickest?". 
By having a system that can answer all these types of questions, the faculty advisor will have to spend 
less time advising each student. In fact, the advisor will only be required to handle exceptions for 
students. However, the intelligent aspect of the system allows the faculty advisor to resolve exceptions 
with little or no, effort while insuring that students are advised consistently even if more than one 
faculty member is responsible for advising. As current research emphasizes, students are demanding better 
advising ~,stems. At the same time, they do not want to communicate with a faculty advisor that will 
become too personal in their advice. The IUA provides the facility students desire. The IUA will be extended 
to collect data relating courses completed and their success coefficients with the successful completion 
of a particular degree. Using this information, the IUA will be able to suggest a degree program for 
an undecided major. It is anticipated that the system will be fully implemented in the Computer Science 
Department at Sam Houston State University., shortly. After it is refined, it will be made available 
to other departments on campus. The desired end result x~all be better student advising, and hence, better 
student retention, with less faculty resources.  REFERENCES <RefA>1. Fielstein, Lynda L., Student Priorities
