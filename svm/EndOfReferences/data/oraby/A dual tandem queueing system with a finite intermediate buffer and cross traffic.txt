a single server queueing system with in.nite bu.er at the .rst station and a multi-server queueing system 
with a .nite bu.er at the sec­ond station. Arrival .ow is described by the Batch Marko­vian Arrival Process 
(BMAP ). Service time at the .rst station is generally distributed while at the second station it is 
exponentially distributed. In situation when the in­termediate bu.er between the stations is full at 
the service completion of a customer at the .rst station, this customer is lost or blocks the server 
until service completion in one of the servers at the second station. Besides the customers, which got 
service at the .rst station, an additional MAP .ow (cross tra.c) arrives to the second station directly, 
not entering the .rst station. Ergodicity condition for this system is derived. Stationary state distribution 
of the system at embedded and arbitrary time epochs is computed as well as the main performance measures 
of the system. Numerical results show possibility of optimization of the system operation by means of 
appro­priate choosing the capacity of an intermediate bu.er and the intensity of cross tra.c. Necessity 
of the account of correlation in the arrival processes is illustrated. Categories and Subject Descriptors

an important bridge be­tween the theory of queues and theory of queueing networks. So, they have attracted 
a lot of attention in queueing liter­ature, see, e.g., [1],[2]. Here we will mention only tandem queues 
where the arrival process is described by the BMAP or the MAP . The overwhelming majority of the papers 
de­voted to such tandems are written by A. Gomez-Corral and his group in Spain or by the international 
group having a core in Belarus. The main formal distinction between the models considered in the papers 
by the group from Spain (see, e.g., [3-8]) and the second group (see, e.g. [9-14]) is that the papers 
[3-8] are addressed to the single server tan­dem queues where the arbitrary service time distribution 
is allowed only at the second station, while in [9-14] the ar­bitrary service time distribution is allowed 
only at the .rst station. This distinction prede.nes the di.erent technique of analysis. In [3-8], mainly 
the technique of Quasi-Birth-and-Death processes or G/M/1 type Markov chains (see [15]) is exploited. 
In [9-14], the authors use the technique of quasi-Toeplitz [16] or M/G/1 type Markov chains [17] for 
queues with a bu.er at the .rst station and the technique of asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz [18] Markov 
chains for the queues with retrials at the .rst station in conjunction with the theory of semi-regenerative 
processes, see [19]. In the tandem queues considered in the papers [3-12], both stations of the tandem 
are the single server systems. Only the papers [13-14] deal with the systems where the second station 
is a multi-server queue. The model considered in [13] distinguishes from the model considered in this 
paper by the following three features: (i) there is no bu.er at the .rst station and the customers, which 
arrive when the server is busy, move to the orbit to retry later on; (ii) there is no in­termediate bu.er 
and the customers, which .nish the service at the .rst station when all servers at the second station 
are busy, move to the orbit to retry repeated service at the .rst station; (iii) the customers from the 
additional .ow, which arrive at the second station without processing at the .rst station (cross tra.c), 
have a priority via the reservation of several servers at the second station. The model considered in 
[14] distinguishes from the model considered in this paper by the following three features: (i) there 
is no intermediate bu.er; (ii) there is no cross tra.c; (iii) customers need a random number of servers 
for processing at the second sta­tion.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II contains 
description of the mathematical model. Ergodic­ity condition is proved and the stationary distribution 
of the embedded Markov chain is obtained in Section III. The stationary distribution of the system states 
at an arbitrary time is derived in Section IV. Expressions for some key per­formance measures of the 
system are presented in Section V. Section VI gives some numerical results to illustrate pos­sibility 
of optimization of operation of the system via appro­priate choice of the capacity of the intermediate 
bu.er and the intensity of cross tra.c.  2. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL We consider a tandem queueing system 
consisting of two stations in series. The .rst station is described by a single­server queue with an 
in.nite waiting room. Customers ar­rive to this station according to a BMAP . In the BMAP, arrivals occur 
only at the epochs of transitions of the under­lying process .t,t = 0, which is an irreducible continuous­time 
Markov chain with the .nite state space {0,...,W }. The intensities of transitions, which are accompanied 
by an arrival of a batch consisting of k customers, are combined into the matrices Dk,k = 0, of size 
(W + 1) × (W + 1). The matrix generating function of these matrices is D(z)= proceeds to the second station 
which is represented by the N-server queue with a .nite bu.er of capacity R< 8. If a customer completes 
the service at the .rst station and meets the intermediate bu.er being full, it leaves the sys­tem forever 
with probability ., 0 = . = 1, or, with the com­plementary probability 1 - ., blocks the .rst station 
until the earliest service completion in the servers of the second station. Besides the customers proceeding 
from the .rst station, an additional MAP .ow arrives to the second station directly, not entering the 
.rst station. This MAP is de.ned by the state space {0, 1,...,V } of underlying Markov process .t,t = 
0, and by the matrix generating function H(z)= H0 + H1z, |z|= 1. The rate of the MAP is given by h = 
.H1e, where . is the vector of the stationary distri­bution of the Markov chain .t,t = 0. This vector 
is the unique solution of the system .H(1) = 0, .e = 1. If a cus­tomer from the additional .ow meets, 
upon arrival, the sec­ond station (all servers and intermediate bu.er) being full it leaves the system 
forever. In the opposite case the customer occupies an idle server, if any, or goes to the bu.er. All 
cus­tomers entering the second station (the customers from the BMAP and from the additional MAP ) are 
served accord­ing with FIFO discipline. The service time of any customer has an exponential distribution 
with the parameter µ.  3. THE STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION OF THE EMBEDDED MARKOV CHAIN 8 k=0 f Dkz k , |z|=

tion, n = 1. ator of the process .t,t = 0. The stationary distribution vec­tor . of this process satis.es 
the equations .D(1) = 0, .e = 1 where 0 is a zero row vector and e is a column vector consisting of 1's. 
The fundamental rate . of the BMAP is de.ned as . = .D'(z)|z=1e, and the rate .b of group arrivals is 
de.ned as .b = .(-D0)e. The coe.cient of variation cvar of intervals between group arrivals is de.ned 
by cvar 2 =2.b.(-D0)-1 e - 1. The coe.cient of correlation ccor of the successive intervals between group 
arrivals is given by -1 -12 ccor =(.b.(-D0)(D(1) - D0)(-D0)e - 1)/cvar. The class of BMAP s includes 
many input .ows consid­ered previously, such as stationary Poisson (M ), Erlangian (Ek), Hyper-Markovian 
(HM), Phase-Type (PH), Inter­rupted Poisson Process (IPP ), Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP ). 
In opposite to recurrent (GI) .ows and the PH renewal .ow in particular, the BMAP .ow can be correlated. 
This makes it extremely useful for modeling real .ows in modern telecommunication networks. For more 
in­formation about the BMAP, its properties and particular cases see [20], [21]. The service time of 
customers at the .rst station are inde­pendent identically distributed random variables with dis­tribution 
function B(t) and the .nite .rst moment b1 = Consider the process .n = {in,rn,.n,.n},n = 1, where in 
is the number of customers at the .rst station (not counting the blocked customer) at the epoch tn +0,in 
= 0; rn is the number of customers at the second station at the epoch tn - 0,rn =0,N + R; .n and .n are 
the states of the MAP and BMAP arrival processes, respectively, at the epoch tn,.n = 0,V, .n =0,W. It 
is easy to see that the process .n,n = 1, is a Markov chain. Let us enumerate the states of the chain 
in the lexicographic order and form the square matrices Pi,l, i,l = 0, of size (N + R + 1)(V + 1)(W + 
1) of transition probabilities of the chain from the states having the value i of the .rst component 
to the states having the value l of this component. For further use in the sequel, we introduce the following 
notation: I is an identity matrix of appropriate dimension. When needed, the dimension of the matrix 
will be identi.ed with a su.x; . and . are symbols of the Kronecker product and sum of matrices; ¯ V¯= 
V + 1; W = W + 1; 0 8 P (n, t),n = 0, are coe.cients of the matrix expansion 8 D(z)tn e= f P (n, t)z,

ape­riodic Markov chain whose transition probability matrices Pi,l,i> 0, depend on i and l only via the 
di.erence l -i. So, this chain belongs to the class of multi-dimensional quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains, 
see [16], or the class of M/G/1 type Markov chains which was studied by M. Neuts in [17]. In what follows 
we use the results for quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains to derive the ergodicity condition and calculate 
the stationary distribution of the Markov chain .n,n = 1. 8 k=0 f Dkz k , |z|= 1; Dk D(z)= . Dk, =

the ev­ D(1)t ident relation .e = . we check by direct substitution that the vector x satis.es system

of the Lemma 1 is implemented by ana­ lyzing the probabilities of transition of the Markov chain .n,n 
= 1, at the epochs of the service completion at the .rst station. Corollary 1. The process .n,n = 1, 
is a quasi-Toeplitz Markov chain. tuting the vector x into inequality (4) and using expression (1) for 
Y (z) to calculate the derivative Y ' (1) we reduce in­equality (4) to form (2) using obvious transformations. 
Remark 1. The inequality (2) is intuitively clear on not­ing that the vector y gives the stationary distribution 
of the number of customers at the second station at the service completion epochs at the .rst station 
given the latter sta­tion works non-stop. Then yE2e is a probability that the second station is full 
at the service completion epochs at the .rst station, the summand (1 - .)yE2e(Nµ)-1 de.nes the average 
blocking time of the .rst station under overload con­dition and . is the system load.  In what follows 
we suppose that inequality (2) is ful.lled. Denote by p(i, r, ., .),i = 0,r =0,N + R, . =0,V, . = 0,W, 
the stationary state probabilities of the Markov chain .n,n = 1. Let also pi be the row vector of probabilities 
p(i, r, ., .) listed in the lexicographic order of arguments (r, ., .),i = 0. To compute the vectors 
pi, i = 0, we use the numerically stable algorithm (see [18]) which has been elaborated for cal­culating 
the stationary distribution of the multi-dimensional quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains. The process .t,t = 
0, is non-Markovian. But the stationary distribution of this process can be expressed via the station­ary 
distribution of the embedded Markov chain .n,n = 1, using the results for Markov renewal and semi-regenerative 
processes, see [19]. Let p(i, r, ., ., k) = lim P {it = i, rt = r, .t = ., .t = ., kt = k}, t.8 (6) i 
= 0,r =0,N + R, . =0,V, . =0,W, k =0, 1, 2, be the steady-state probabilities of the process .t,t = 0. 
Let also pi(k) be the vector of probabilities p(i, r, ., ., k) listed in the lexicographic order of components 
(r, ., .),i = 0,k = 0, 1, 2. Theorem 2. The non-zero stationary probability vectors pi(k),i = 0,k =0, 
1, 2, are related to the vectors pi,i = 0, as follows: p0(0) = -t -1p0E (. . D0)-1 , i -1 t [-E (. .

Numerical stability of this algorithm is prede.ned by the fact that the algorithm involves opera­tions 
of summation and multiplication of the matrices while subtraction operation is not used at all.  4. 
THE STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION AT AN ARBITRARY TIME The process of the system states at an arbitrary time 
is de­.ned as .t = {it,rt,.t,.t,kt},t = 0, where it is the number of customers at the .rst station (including 
the blocked cus­tomer, if any); rt is the number of customers at the second station; .t and .t are the 
states of the arrival process at the second and the .rst stations respectively; kt is a random variable 
which takes values 0, 1, 2 depending on whether f de.ned by the formula: -1 -1 t = b1 + p0E (-D 0)e 
+ (1 - .).(1)E 2e(Nµ). Proof. The process .t,t = 0, is a semi-regenerative one with the embedded Markov 
renewal process {.n,tn},n = 1. By [19], limits (6) exist if the process {.n,tn} is an irre­ducible aperiodic 
and the value t of the mean inter-departure time at the .rst station is .nite. It is easily veri.ed that 
er­godicity of the Markov chain .n,n = 1, implies that all these conditions hold true. So, limits (7) 
exist if inequality (2) is satis.ed. Formulas for the steady-state probability vectors pi(k),i = 0,k 
=0, 1, 2, are derived in direct way taking into account the probabilistic sense of involved matrices 
and using the limiting theorem for semi-regenerative processes given in [19]. Corollary 3. The vectors 
pi,i = 0, of the steady state probabilities of the process .t = {it,rt,.t,.t},t = 0, 2 are (k), i = 0. 
calculated as pi =  5. PERFORMANCE MEASURES Having computed the stationary distributions pi,i = 0, 
and pi,i = 0, we can .nd a number of stationary performance measures of the system under consideration. 
The most im­portant performance measures are calculated as follows: Mean number of customers at the .rst 
station at the service completion epochs at this station and at an arbitrary time L1 = . ' (1)e,L 1 = 
P ' (1)e. Hereinafter we use notation 88 ii .(z)= t piz, P (z)= t piz, |z|= 1, i=0 i=0 for the vector 
generating functions of the stationary distributions pi,i = 0, and pi,i = 0. Mean number of customers

demonstrate feasibility of the developed algorithms and numerically show some interesting features of 
the system un­der consideration we present the results of two experiments. Experiment 1. In this experiment, 
we solve numerically the problem of optimal choice of the fundamental rate h of the additional exogenous 
Markovian .ow (cross tra.c). We con­sider the following cost criterion (an average pro.t obtained by 
the system by means of information transmission per unit time under the steady-state operation of the 
system): (1) (2) J = J(h)= c1.(1 - P )+ c2h(1 - P ). lossloss Here c1 and c2 are gains for the service 
of one customer from BMAP and additional MAP respectively. Our aim is to .nd numerically the optimal 
value h that provides the maximal value to cost criterion. It is intuitively clear that this optimization 
problem is not trivial. If the rate h is small, we have a small value of (1) the probability Ploss (that 
an arbitrary customer from the BMAP input .ow to the tandem will be lost) and a big value (1) of the 
summand c1.(1-Ploss) in the cost criterion J(h), but a small value of the summand c2h(1 - P (2) ). When 
the rate loss h grows, the .rst summand decreases while the second one increases. So, the optimal value 
of h is not clear without computation of the cost criterion for the di.erent values of h. Let us introduce 
two MAP s having the same fundamen­tal rate equal 2 and squared coe.cient of variation c 2 = var 12.2732. 
The MAP1 has the coe.cient of correlation ccor = 0.1 and is de.ned by the matrices ( -2.34988 0.0000132 
) D0 = , 0.0000004 -0.051472 ( 2.342692 0.0072012 ) D1 = . 0.0401068 0.0113648 The MAP2 has the coe.cient 
of correlation ccor =0.2 and is de.ned by the matrices ( -2.698152 0.000006 ) H0 = ,  0.000002 -0.087782 
( 2.680274 0.017872 ) H1 = . 0.0489708 0.0388092 Based on MAP1, we construct the BMAP which arrives to 
the .rst station of tandem. This BMAP is de.ned by the matrices Dk,k =0, 5. To build these matrices, 
we fol­low such a way. The matrix D0 is the same as D0 in MAP1 and the rest of the matrices are calculates 
as Dk = D1.k-1(1 - .)/(1 - .5),k =1, 5, where . =0.8. It means that the maximal size of the batch is 
equal to 5 and the batch size distribution has the truncated geometrical distri­bution. Then we normalize 
the matrices Dk,k =0, 5, (by multiplying them by a constant 1.95) to get the BMAP with fundamental rate 
. = 10. We consider the MAP2 as the descriptor of additional MAP .ow (cross tra.c). The service time 
at the .rst station has the Erlangian dis­tribution of order 3 with parameter 80. The mean service  
 (1) Figure 1: Ploss as function of arrival rate h for dif­ferent values of probability .. (2) Figure 
2: Ploss as function of arrival rate h for dif­ferent values of probability .. time is b1 =0.0375 and 
the squared coe.cient of variation is cvar 2 =1/3. The number of servers at the second station is N = 
3, intermediate bu.er size is equal to R = 5, the service rate at the second station is µ = 5. Let us 
vary the arrival rate h for the MAP2 arrival process in the in­terval [0.1, 14] by multiplying the matrices 
H0,H1 by some positive constant. Figures 1, 2 illustrate the dependence of the loss probabil­ (1) (2) 
ities P and P on the rate h for di.erent values of loss loss probability .. As it is expected, both the 
loss probabilities increase with the grow of the arrival rate h. Probability . that a customer, which 
completes the service at the .rst sta­tion and meets the intermediate bu.er being full leaves the system 
forever, also has an essential in.uence on the values (1) of these probabilities. Probability Ploss becomes 
less when (2) . decreases while probability Ploss is higher when . is small. Figures 3, 4 show the dependence 
of the mean number .(1- (1) Ploss) of customers from BMAP and the mean number (2) h(1 - Ploss) of customers 
from additional MAP served at the second station during a unit of time. Dependence of the cost criterion 
J on the arrival rate h under the di.erent values of probability . is presented in Figure 5. The cost 
coe.cients in the cost criterion are .xed here as follows: c1 = 10,c2 =4. For the curves presented in 
Figure 5, the optimal values of cost criterion J * are equal to 101.8, 97.9, 94.7, 92.4 when the probability 
. takes the values . =0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and the optimal arrival rates h Figure 3: .(1 - P (1) ) as function 
of arrival rate h for loss di.erent values of probability .. (2) Figure 4: h(1 - Ploss) as function of 
arrival rate h for di.erent values of probability .. are equal to h =9.1, 8, 5.7, 4.5, respectively. 
The e.ect of decreasing of the arrival rate h of cross tra.c when the value ., which is the probability 
of leaving the system in the case the intermediate bu.er is full, increases looks, at the .rst glance, 
a bit strange. The increase of . im­plies that more customers from the BMAP will be lost, so, may be, 
the second station can serve more customers from cross tra.c and so, the optimal value of h should increase, 
but not decrease, as we observe in Figure 5. The explanation of this situation stems from the values 
of costs c1 and c2. We have .xed c1 2.5 times larger than c2, i.e., the charge paid for the loss of a 
customer from the Figure 5: The cost criterion as function of arrival rate h for di.erent values of probability 
..  BMAP is much more than the charge paid for the loss of a customer from the additional MAP. So, the 
customers from the BMAP are more valuable for the system and we should try to avoid their loss. This 
implies that for bigger values of probability . of leaving the system in the case the intermediate bu.er 
is full we have to decrease probability that the intermediate bu.er is full. Thus, we should decrease 
the rate h of cross-tra.c. This explains the e.ect which we observe in Figure 5. Experiment 2. This experiment 
has two goals. The main one is to show that the bu.er capacity R is an important parameter of the system 
and e.ectiveness of the system op­eration can be improved by means of the proper choice of R. The second 
goal is to illustrate that characteristics of the system essentially depend not only on the intensities 
of the arrival processes, but also on correlation in these processes. We formulate and numerically solve 
the problem of optimal choice of the bu.er capacity. The aim of the optimization is to minimize the following 
cost criterion: (1) (2) T = T (R)= c1.P + c2hP + c3R loss loss which is an average charge paid by the 
system per unit time. Here c1(c2) is a charge which is paid for the loss of one cus­tomer from BMAP (MAP 
), c3 is a cost of the maintenance of one place in the bu.er per unit time. Our goal is to .nd the optimal 
value R * which provides the minimal value to this cost criterion. This optimization problem is also 
non-trivial. Because the system pays for the maintenance of the each place in the bu.er, the bu.er capacity 
R should the smaller the bet­ (1) (1) ter. However, both loss probabilities P and P increase loss loss 
when the bu.er capacity R decreases. So, the system should properly choose the capacity R depending on 
the parameters and cost coe.cients ck,k =1, 2, 3. To illustrate the importance of consideration of the 
arrival .ows as the BMAP and MAP , but not as the group sta­tionary and stationary Poisson processes 
with the same in­tensities we consider the formulated optimization problem for three sets of the system 
parameters. In the .rst set, we assume that arrival .ow at the .rst station and cross tra.c are described 
by the BMAP and additional MAP arrival processes de.ned in the .rst experiment. In the second set, we 
assume that the arrival process at the .rst station is de­.ned as a stationary group Poisson process 
(coded as Mx) and the additional .ow is de.ned as a stationary Poisson process (coded as M ). In the 
third set, both arrival pro­cesses are de.ned as a stationary Poisson processes. The corresponding arrival 
processes in all three sets have the same fundamental rate. The di.erence is that the BMAP and the MAP 
arrival processes are correlated (coe.cient of correlation of the successive inter-arrival times is equal 
to 0.1 and 0.2, respectively) while the stationary group Pois­son process and the stationary Poisson 
process are recurrent what implies that the coe.cient of correlation of the succes­sive inter-arrival 
times is equal to 0. The rest of the system parameters is .xed as follows. The service time at the .rst 
station has the Erlangian distribu­tion of order 3 with parameter 80. The number N of servers  Figure 
6: The cost criterion as a function of the bu.er capacity R. at the second station is equal to 3, the 
service rate µ at the second station is equal to 5 and the probability . is equal to 0.6. The cost coe.cients 
in the cost criterion are assumed to be as follows: c1 = 10,c2 = 10,c3 =2. The value of the cost criterion 
T as a function of the bu.er capacity R is presented in Figure 6. The curve coded as (BMAP, MAP ) corresponds 
to case when the BMAP and additional MAP arrival processes are identical with ones presented in the .rst 
experiment. The curve coded as (Mx,M) corresponds to case when the arrival process at the .rst station 
is a group Poisson process and the additional .ow is a Poisson process. The curve coded as (M, M) corresponds 
to case when both arrival processes are the Poisson ones. All .ows entering the .rst station have the 
fundamental rate . = 10 and all additional .ows entering the second station have the fundamental rate 
h =2. Table 1 contains the values of the cost criterion T in this ex­ample. The optimal value T * of 
the cost criterion is printed in bold face. It is seen from Table 1 that the optimal bu.er capacity R 
* is equal to 4 for all cases. For di.erent values of R, R = 0, the relative gain of optimal design (in 
comparison with the choice of an arbitrary number R as a bu.er capacity) is calculated as T (R) - T (R 
* ) grel(R) = 100%. T (R*) E.g., in the case (BMAP, MAP ) the optimal value of cost criterion T * is 
equal to 24.8606 and the optimal bu.er ca­pacity is R * =4. The minimal relative gain grel(R) for R having 
the values near the optimal value is about 1 - 4%. The maximal relative gain is more than 29% if we use 
the bu.er capacity 4 instead of 12 (and even more if we choose the bu.er capacity more than 12). In comparison 
with the system without bu.er (R = 0), the gain is equal to 31%. So, the pro.t obtained from optimization 
of the bu.er capacity is quite essential.  7. CONCLUSIONS We considered a new dual tandem queue with 
two Marko­vian Arrival Processes, multi-server second station and a .­nite intermediate bu.er. We computed 
the stationary distri­bution of the system states at the service completion epochs  Table 1: The value

at the .rst station and at arbitrary time as well as the key performance measures of the system. The 
presented nu­merical results show that the proposed algorithms well suit for computer realization. It 
is shown that the throughput of the system can be optimized by means of an appropri­ate choice of the 
rate of the .ow, which enters directly at the second station. The criterion, which involves the charge 
for customers loss and the intermediate bu.er maintenance, can be e.ectively optimized by the appropriate 
choice of this bu.er capacity. As byproduct, the dependence of the system performance measures on the 
correlation in arrival processes is shown. Theoretically, the presented results can be easily extended 
to the cases when the service times at the second station have PH type distribution, probably depending 
on the type of the customer, when there are several additional arrival processes. The problem would be 
only the dimension of the corresponding processes which can cause problems in computer implementation 
of the proposed algorithms.  8. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported in part by Belarusian Republican
