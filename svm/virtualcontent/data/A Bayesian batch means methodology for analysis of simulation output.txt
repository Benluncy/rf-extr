PROCESS ASSUMPTIONS The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of Bayesian methodology in 
the analysis of simulation output. Specifically, the Bayesian methodology is introduced in the context 
of the batch means procedure for building a confidence interval for the output mean. We assume that the 
output process is at steady state or equivalently that the output process is second order station- ary. 
We also assume that the length is fixed at say n. So the output process can be given by X I, X 2, -.. 
, X n, a sequence of observations from a continuous state stationary stochastic process with mean M, 
 variance O2x and autocorrelation function {Pi}i=l In this research we batch the n observations into 
k batches of size m and assume that mk=n. The resulting batch means are assumed to be independ- ent and 
normally distributed. This provides the setting for the Bayesian analysis.  2. THE BAYESIAN APPROACH 
 There are two major reasons why the Bayesian ap- proach may be superior to the sampling theory ap- proach. 
The Bayesian method incorporates more information by using prior information to sup- plement the collected 
data. And a Bayesian con- clusion does not need a frequency interpretation. The minimum components that 
comprise a Bayesian problem are (i) the form of the prior distribu- tion, (ii) the assessment of the 
prior distribu- tion, (iii) the form of the conditional distri- bution of the data, and (iv) the data. 
The data and the conditional distribution of the data are the same for the Bayesian and sampling theory 
ap- proaches.  The form of the prior distribution and the assess- ment of the prior distribution are 
needed only in the Bayesian approach. The specific Bayesian approach that we use in this paper is termed 
the normal-normal model, because the prior and the conditional distribution are both assumed to be normally 
distributed.  3. ASSESSMENT OF PRIOR PARAMETERS The parameters of the prior distribution are as- sessed 
in two different ways. First, they are set based on the subjective judgment of the user. In the absence 
of knowledge of the process we pre- sent a data determined prior which uses the vari- aÂ£ion between subgroups 
of the data to set the prior parameters.  4. RESULTS This Bayesian batch means methodology has been 
thoroughly tested. The five measures of effec- tiveness suggested in Schriber and Andrews (1981) are 
reported for a variety of simulated theoreti- cal output processes. In addition, each run is compared 
with various batch means procedures. In general, the incorporation of a prior distribution improves the 
interval estimate. The improvement is greatest when the prior information is accurate and the run length 
is small. Complete details may be found in Andrews and Schriber (1983). REFERENCES <RefA><SinRef><author>Andrews, R W</author>, <author>Schriber,
