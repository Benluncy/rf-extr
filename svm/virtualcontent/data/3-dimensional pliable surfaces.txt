Burnaby, B.C. V5A 1S6 CANADA carpenda@cs.sfu.ca ABSTRACT A fundamental issue in user interface design 
is the effec­ tive use of available screen space, commonly referred to as the screen real estate problem. 
This paper presents a new distortion-based viewing tool for exploring large information spaces through 
the use of a three-dimensional pliable surface. Arbitrarily-shaped regions (foci) on the surface may 
be se­ lected and pulled towards or pushed away from the viewer thereby increasing or decreasing the 
level of detail contained within each region. Furthermore, multiple foci are smoothly blended together 
such that there is no loss of context. The manipulation and blending of foci is accomplished using a 
fairly simple mathematical model based on gaussian curves. The significance of this approach is that 
it utilizes precogni­ tive perceptual cues about the three-dimensional surface to make the distortions 
comprehensible, and allows the user to interactively control the location, shape, and extent of the distortion 
in very large graphs or maps. KEYWORDS: Distortion viewing, screen layout, 3D inter­ actions, information 
visualization, interface metaphors, inter­ face design issues INTRODUCTION Since the advent of video 
display terminals as the primary in­terface to the computer, how to best make use of the available screen 
space has been a fundamental issue in user interface design. In fact, the necessity for effective solutions 
to this problem has intensified as technology has advanced, with the ability to produce visual data in 
greater volumes continuing to outstrip the rate at which display technology has developed. This issue 
is traditionally referred to as the screen real estate problem. A significant advance in the screen real 
estate problem was the leap from command line access to a windowing environment. Even with the addition 
of the now familiar features of panning Permission to make digitrtl/hard copies of all or pafl of this

UIST 95 Pittsburgh PA USA 01995 ACM O-89791-709-x/95/l 1..$3.50 and zooming, the desire to examine detail 
often conflicts with the ability to maintain global context. Zooming out of or compressing the data to 
fit within the space of the screen can result in its becoming too dense to discern detail. Zooming into 
or magnifying a region will result in the loss of context, Multiple views allow for the simultaneous 
display of detail and global structure, however the integration of these distinct views must be performed 
consciously by the user. Evidence as to how we combine information from multiple sensory channels has 
arisen from a number of studies in experimental psychology [5, 12, 13]. Information perceived as a single 
event is integrated automatically, however that perceived as distinct events requires a more strenuous 
reintegration. While the user may be cognitively aware that views in multiple windows pertain to a single 
information space, perceptually they remain distinct. For example, the effort of maintaining which detail 
belongs where and of current locations has to be performed consciously by the user. If the desired detail 
view can be provided in a manner that smooth] y integrates it into the global context then it preserves 
the possibility of visual gestalt. This work presents the development of a tool for exploring large information 
spaces which: Increases the amount of information that can usefully be presented on a computer screen. 
. Creates a situation that can utilize visual gestalt by re­ taining the perception of the information 
space as a single event. This avoids creating situations that are known to be cognitively strenuous. 
 . Keeps the resulting images comprehensible. Encodes as much information as possible in a manner that 
will access low level perceptual abilities. This paper focuses on two broad classes of information spaces: 
graphs and maps. By graphs we refer to visual representa­tions where information is expressed as entities 
(nodes) and relationships between them (edges), and by maps to repre­sentations which also contain distance 
information. The next section discusses distortion viewing techniques most closely related to this work. 
The concept behind 3D pliable surfaces is then described. This is follow by an explanation that explains 
the development of the 3D pliable surface to 217 provide a detail within context viewing tool. Then 
the visual cues used to provide comprehension of the surface distortion are presented. Finally, the advantages 
and limitations of this approach are discussed. RELATED WORK There have been several different approaches 
to the screen real estate problem in the literature. Some simplify the task by applying various filtering 
techniques [3, 6]. Others in­vestigate the advantages of using 3D to display the infor­mation [4, 17, 
24]. Finally, there are those that distort the viewing space to provide unified views that contain selected 
detail within context [1, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20]. It is the latter group, in particular those that 
use perspective to provide distortion [11, 18], that pertain most closely to the approach presented here. 
Initially Furnas [6] observed that a fisheye, or very wide an­gle lens, provides a world view by showing 
a focus in great detail and gradually decreasing this detail as distance from the focus increases. His 
studies in various subject areas (ge­ography, workplaces, history, and newspapers) reveal that people 
naturally retain and present information in this man­ner. While this work has laid the foundations for 
most of the distortion viewing techniques, his examples threshold a de­gree of interest function, creating 
filtered fisheye views with gaps in context. This could be problematic if, for instance, the next section 
of interest was in one of these gaps. Sakar and Brown [19] expand upon Furnas approach by us­ing a visual 
representation to express fisheye views of graphs. Given a current focal point, they use a trade off 
between a node s assigned apriori importance and its distance to the fo­cus point to establish the position, 
size, and amount of detail to display for each node. However, this approach offers only single focal 
points and is interactive for fairly small graphs (approximately 100 nodes). Perspective wall [11 ] and 
Document lens [18] both use per­spective to provide magnification of the focus and the result­ing 3D 
image to provide visual information about the context and how it has been distorted. However, they only 
provide a single focal point and were designed for particular data. Perspective Wall is realistically 
limited to linear information and Document Lens has only been applied to displaying text. Conceivably 
the latter could be used to display other types of 2D data, such as maps or graphs, although much of 
the perspective information provided by the regular patterns in text would be lost. Hyperbolic display 
[10] and CATGRAPH [8] use a simple mathematical function, hyperbola and arctan respectively, for their 
magnification and distortion. The Hyperbolic display provides an interactive single focus viewing tool, 
while CAT-GRAPH allows for multiple foci and uses both rectangular and polar transformations. Both of 
these functions are asymp­totic and as a result spread the distortion across the entire image and cause 
extreme compression at the edges. Neither of these approaches provide for the possibility of creating 
a focus that spans an area of the graph nor allow for magni­fication of such a focus to scale in a manner 
that maintains distance relationships. The rubber sheet approach [20] based on morphing [2] pro­vides 
multiple foci as convex polygons, does not cause ar­eas of unrequested magnification, and maintains contextual 
frame. However, several problems are mentioned with regard to this method. The transformational technique 
does not have a general inverse mapping which makes editing across the en­tire distorted image non-trivial. 
Also, this tool provides real time response for graphs of up to only a few hundred nodes and a similar 
number of links, and sometimes more than one iteration is required to provide the right balance between 
de­tail and context, In terms of large information spaces this is quite limiting. Much of the desired 
functionality exists but not within a single approach. Reasonable response time is available from the 
mathematically-based approaches, distortion comprehension from the 3D perspective approaches, and a multi-focal 
smooth integration display from the morphing approach. Our 3D pliable surface 3DPS effectively combines 
these advantages. CONCEPT In creating our viewing tool for a two-dimensional informa­tion space we make 
a distinction between the graph or map as the image encoding the information and the surface on which 
it is displayed. The resulting tool will not be tied to any particular kind of image. As the visual cues 
are provided about the surface, distortions will still be readable even when there are gaps in the image. 
Current distortions can be quite readable when applied to reguhu-ly spaced information, par­ ticularly 
grids or text; unfortunately not all information can be laid out so regularly. Choice of the distortion 
transformation is crucial as it will affect both performance and the visual result. Ideally, one would 
like a simple mathematical function that will provide smooth integration from the focus through the distorted 
sec­tion and into the context; preferably it would have no dis­continuities in curvature. We chose the 
three-dimensional gaussian curve as its bell shape curves away from the focus at its apex and inflects 
to curve gently back into the surface (Fig­ure 1). These gaussian curves transform the two-dimensional 
z Figure 1: 3-D Surface of Blended Gaussian Curves flat surface into a three-dimensional curved surface. 
The three-dimensional nature of this distortion approach offers several advantages: 1. Using single point 
perspective to view the three-dimensional surface from above provides detail with magnification to scale 
and a readily controllable context. 2, It provides a useful metaphor for the actions performed to create 
the distortions. Pulling a section towards oneself to see it better, or in this case magnify it, appears 
to be a natural response, 3. It also provides a metaphor for the overall appearance; the end result 
of a multi-focal view can be seen as a softly curved landscape with hills and valleys. 4. While there 
is on-going discussion regarding the amount of information that humans can comprehend when presented 
three-dimensionally, Ware s studies [23] imply that there is some truth to the notion that because humans 
evolved in a 3D world they are better at retrieving information about it.  While we feel that being 
able to understand the resulting distortion is significant for both graphs and maps there is a particular 
point to be made for the latter, In our culture, inter­preting maps assumes that distance is to scale 
and that scale is normally consistent across the map and is clearly indicated. A distortion view will 
create an image of the map containing sections of varying scale. User disorientation when viewing a distorted 
map has been reported [20] particularly when the map was familiar. We suggest that this disorientation 
results from the discrepancy between the information provided by the distorted map and what the users 
feel they know to be true about the original map. This effect parallels what Tufte [21] discusses extensively 
as lie factors . In this case previous knowledge is protecting the user from assimilating false in­formation. 
In unfamiliar information spaces there is a greater chance of being misled. To dispel the possibilities 
of misleading users the form of the 3D pliable surface should be clearly displayed. This will create 
comprehensible distortion allowing the user to under­stand at a glance which sections are magnified and 
which are compressed with an intuitive notion of the extent. One choice for revealing form is to employ 
shading. It has been well established that humans can discern three­dimensional shape from shading alone 
[16, 20], and there is considerable evidence to support the fact that this is a low level precognitive 
skill [9]. Such a low level visual routine will in­terfere less with conscious processing and may even 
provide an aspect of the interface that requires no learning [22]. A different choice is the use of perspective 
to provide distor­ tion information. However, understanding three-dimensions from perspective appears 
to be a learned skill and demon­ stratably culturally tied [7]. Also, perspective has often been indicated 
with the outlines of a three-dimensional shape [11] or by the visual pattern of the data [ 18]. The choice 
of smooth curves for distortion and allowing for data with irregular lay­ outs means neither outlines 
nor patterns in the data will reveal the nature of the distortions. However, using a regular grid reveals 
the shape of the distortions by accessing two human depth cues: it provides perspective information without 
re­ quiring edges and serves as a texture gradient. 3D PLIABLE SURFACE This section steps through the 
creation and manipulation of a 3D pliable surface. We start from the simplest case where a single focus 
is in the center of the field of view and progress through to the interaction of multiple foci. Single 
focus at the center of the field of view Here the action of pulling the region of interest up, perpen­dicular 
to the surface, produces the desired magnification. The surrounding region is stretched over a three-dimensional 
gaussian curve connecting the magnified region to the original plane of the surface (Figure 2). This 
controls the compres­sion of the surrounding context and the integration of the magnified region back 
into the original image. Figure 2: Single focus in the center of the field of view: left; top view, center; 
3D view, right profile with ToEye vectors Magnification of single focus to scale The center of the 3D 
gaussian curve is projected up to the height h., but to provide a flat region where only scaling occurs, 
the curve may be truncated; limited to a fraction ~ of this maximum height (Figure 3). The points of 
the graph/map in the central magnified region are all projected up to the same height, hcf. The height 
hP of all other points on the curve is a simple relationship of distance dP to the center of the region, 
the height h, and its standard deviation s.: hP = h.exp-% As in Figure 3 projecting all points perpendicular 
to the plane provides the desired magnification and compression in the appropriate regions. Figure 3: 
Single focus with flattened top Single focus anywhere in the field of view If, ~owever, the ~egion of 
interest is located at a point other than that directly below the viewpoint, projection perpendic­ular 
to the plane of the surface causes the desired region to move out of the viewing region as it increases 
in magnifica­tion (Figure 4). This is a fundamental geometric limitation of the configuration of the 
viewing frustrum used in single-point perspective projection. Document lens [18] solves this prob­lem 
by translating the viewpoint so that it remains directly above the focus. AAA 11 Figure 4: Single off-center 
focus, projected perpen­ dicular to the plane. Dotted lines denote the viewing frustrum Figure 5: Off-center 
curve projected to the viewpoint Since it is our goal to have multiple foci, the solution is to replace 
the vector perpendicular to the plane with one directed to the eye (Figure 5). This ToEye vector is derived 
from the center of the magnified region on the plane to the viewpoint and is used for all points within 
the domain of the curve. Simply projecting each point towards the viewpoint would result in all points 
converging along these vectors at a rate that cancels out the effects of perspective transformation (Figure 
6). I I I Figure 6: All points projected directly towards the view­ point and resulting lack of distortion 
Also it is desirable to keep the systems response to a user s actions independent of the location of 
the focus on the viewing plane. If aunitlength vector were used as the basis of the distortions at each 
point, the z-component (which we assume to be normal to the undistorted surface) would differ for each 
location. What is required is that not the length but the Z­component of each vector be constant. This 
is accomplished by dividing each ToEye vector by the same constant (Figure 7). Within the focus region, 
where all points are projected to the same height, scaling is still preserved. In fact this solution 
has the added benefit of allowing a user to specify more than one focus at a time (Figures 8 and 10). 
Multiple foci In the case of overlapping multiple foci the end result should be a smoothly curving surface, 
allowing the entire image to remain visible. A point under multiple curves will have a pro­jection vector 
associated with each curve. Simply using the Ve.mrsby Ix@ Normalized ///// ] \\\\\ Vectors Nonndued by

in a discontinuity where the dominance switches from one curve to another. Because all curves have vectors 
that converge as they approach the viewpoint, points to either side of this discontinuity may, if the 
horizontal displacements are sizeable, reverse their order­ing across the seam (Figure 9). Figure 9: 
Two foci colliding Figure 10: Two foci, now resolved using blending with each foci s ToEye vector To 
prevent this buckling adjoining curves are b~ended across their seams. From these curves both the height 
and the di­rection to which the point is to be projected are calculated as follows: The height will 
be max(h~) of the curves. The ToEye vector of each curve is weighted by the curve s height at the points 
location. These weighted ToEye vectors are then averaged. This new averaged ToEye vector it then renormalized 
such that its 2 component= 1. The point is then projected a distance max(h~) along the direction of the 
averaged ToEye vector. -  This blending (Figure 11) creates a gradual shift in the di­rection of the 
projection vectors between curves allowing for lauzer distortions to interact more closely, while still

 Foci with arbitrarv shaDes The single point fu~ctio~ foci discussed so far can be extended to provide 
foci of other arbitraxy shapes as well, for example lines or polygons (Figure 12). Now the height hP 
of a point outside of a focus but within a region is determined not by its distance from the center of 
the region but by its distance to the edge of the defined focus. If the point is either on the line or 
within the polygonal focus it is projected to the full height h. of the curve. The center of the arbitrary 
region is still used to determine the vector to the eye. Distortion control In any distortion viewing 
tool compromises are made between the amount of magnification in each foci and the amount of compression 
in the rest of the image. Our model offers the user considerable control not only over how much compres­sion 
there is but where minimum and maximum compression occurs. The pattern of compression is a direct result 
of the slope of the curve. We allow control of the curve s profile through the height h. (Figure 13) 
and standard deviation Sc (Figure 14). In this manner it is possible to choose a more gradual integration 
from focus to context or to limit the extent of the distortion, causing more compression in the distorted 
region. All curves have their characteristic profiles and resulting pat-Figure 12: Various shapes of 
foci: clockwise from the top left: point, line, concave and convex polygons Figure 13: Single foci: effects 
of varying height with fixed deviation Figure 14: Single foci: effects of varying deviation with fixed 
height terns of compression; the gaussian in particular tends to have a broad top around the focus where 
the magnification of the adjacent area lags only slightly behind that of the focus. In some applications 
the accompanying magnification of the section around the focus is ideal, providing good local con­text. 
However, in other situations this uses too much screen space. Another characteristic of the gaussian 
curve is its familiar bell shape that tends to result in a ring of high compression where the tangent 
to the surface of the curve nears coincidence with the vector from the surface to the viewpoint (Figure 
15). In order to adjust this distribution of compression the profile of the basis curve may be modified 
by subtracting from it a second function, in this case a simple half sine wave (Figure 16). The domain 
of the sine (O, m) is normalized across the domain of the gaussian curve (defined to extend to a distance 
of three standard deviations, beyond which the result of the height calculation is negligibly small). 
As all of these distortion controls are left up to the user, it is COMPREHENSION A primary goal of this 
work has been to make the distortion Vkwpoint visually comprehensible. The separation of the image from 
the distortions of the surface means that the original topology of the image is maintained across the 
surface. Once the sur- Tangent Vtxtor face is manipulated the image is dropped onto it. Displaying a 
surface in such a manner as to reveal its three-dimensional form provides the perceptual information 
that describes the distortion. Normal Vector Seeing the distortion A map of the greater Vancouver area 
(Figure 18) is used to I!K illustrate the visual cues provided. Figure 19 shows the same Figure 15: Relationship 
between compression and an­gle of surface to viewer Figure 16: Single foci: effects of varying the secondary 
function possible to extend the distortion to a point that causes some areas to be compressed beyond 
visibility. However, as the slope and curvature are adjustable and reversible directly by the user, it 
is possible to interactively redistribute the context in non-focal areas without losing focal magnification. 
1 I Figure 17: Role of long lines in revealing distortion Displaying nodes and edges At this point all 
of the images we are displaying with 3DPS are stored as graphs; that is they consist of nodes and edges. 
Nodes are currently displayed either as single points or as squares. Edges are segmented small enough 
so that they will lie snuggly against the surface. This actually provides additional information about 
the surface. Information spaces that contains long lines now aid in the description of the surface (Figure 
17). map with a single focus ;ontaining Stanley Park. Figure 18: Undistorted map of greater Vancouver 
area A simple cue is to outline the edges of the distorted areas. These outlines show at a glance the 
size and shape of the magnified scaled areas and the extent of the distorted regions. This is computationally 
simple and visually minimal, and does not provide degree of distortion information. For this it is necessary 
to reveal more detail about the shape of the surface. A grid can be displayed over the entire surface, 
providing both curve and perspective information (Figure 20). Its lines indicate relative magnification 
as well as serving as a texture gradient. Alternately (Figure 2 I ), or simultaneous y (Figure 22), the 
entire surface can be shaded by placing control points for a NURB surface at the grid intersections and 
rendering the NURB with a simple lighting model. All of these visual cues are optional and are displayed 
in shades of grey, so that while they are readily visible apart or in unison they do not dominate the 
image. This is crucial for the shading since the interpretation of it being the result of luminance has 
much to do with its use in the establishment of 3D shape. Maintaining Visual Frame In maintaining context 
it is important that the edges of the image stay in sight and are recognizable. A good deal of 222 UIST

grid overlay context information is provided by the fact that large portions of the image remain undistorted 
and that each distorted area is itself bounded and blends back into the undistorted back­ground. However, 
as the vector used for the whole curve is the ToEye vector for its center it is possible for the edge 
of a curve as it is pulled up to slide out of the viewing frustrum. One solution is to add a ring of 
ToEye vectors around the edge of the viewing surface such that the vectors are averaged in to counteract 
the sliding effect. While this does help in keep­ing the edges of the surface in the viewing frustrum, 
it also compresses the area available for undistorted foci. Taking ad­vantage of a three-dimensional 
viewing environment we can simply expand the field of view. While slightly compressing the whole image 
this will maintain the current distortion and Figure 21: Distorted map with presentation surface shaded 
to reveal form Figure 22: Distorted map with shading and grid bring all edges back into view. Reversibility 
Another important factor in comprehending the distortion is reversibility [15]. If one is making use 
of this tool as a browser one does not want the undistorted original image to be unrecoverable, in part 
or in total. Also, if the distortions were quickly and easily reversible the user could use this to reference 
the original topology. Therefore pulling and pushing should have equal and opposite effects. Magnification 
To indicate the amount of magnification that can be provided we expand a single node in a grid graph. 
Figure 23 shows the undistorted graph on the left, and on the right shows the -,,/. ,?..: . Figure 23: 
Illustrating degree of magnification 1 Figure 24: On the left, a map of North America; on the right

only is a high degree of magnification available but be­cause the image itself has not been distorted 
very densely packed information will expand to scale. For example, we scaled the map of the greater Vancouver 
area (Figure 18) into place in our map of North America (Figure 24). Displaying this combined map undistorted 
just shows a slightly larger than usual black spot where Vancouver resides. Pulling this section up reveals 
its detail. 3DPS is capable of a great variety of focal shapes and with many patterns of magnification 
and compression. To illus­trate just a few of the possibilities we have included a two foci image of 
the Vancouver area (Figure 25), and a three foci image of North America (Figure 26). The last series 
shows the Vancouver area with four focal points (Figure 27, 28 and 25). The contrast between the images 
with and without dis­tortion clues demonstrates how either the shading or the grid can disambiguate the 
distortions. CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a three-dimensional pliable surface as a tool for addressing 
the screen real estate problem. The ap­proach integrates the desirable properties of previous methods 
to considerably increase the amount of information that can usefully be presented on a computer screen. 
Through several examples we have shown that the viewing aspect of this tool can handle very dense information. 
Our approach makes use of a distortion transformation based Figure 25: Vancouver area with two focal 
points; Bur­ ra;d Inlet and Annacis Island Figure 26: North America with three focal points; Van­ couver, 
Missouri, and Connecticut on a simple mathematical function (gaussian curve). How­ever, although gaussian 
curves were chosen because of their gentle curvature out from the focus and back into the con­text they 
have a tendency to be radially compressed about halfway up the slope. We addressed this problem by allow­ing 
for modification of the gaussian with an auxiliary curve, a half sine wave. To further explore the applicability 
of other types of curves we propose to build a curve library. Performance comparisons are difficult across 
varying plat­forms and implementations, However, in terms of com­plexity this algorithm is comparable 
to the morphing based approach [20]. Both are O(njp), where n is the number of points to be projected, 
~ is the number of focal points. The Figure 27: Vancouver area with four focal points; Atkinson Point,

dis tortion revealed by the grid only difference is that we define p as the average number of focal 
polygon points, while for their algorithm p is the average number of vector pairs per focal polygon. 
As these vector pairs define the edges of the focal polygons the dif­ference is negligible. However, 
their algorithm may need to be applied iteratively to keep the resulting image within its window. Furthermore, 
to prevent change in relative ordering of nodes along z and y dimensions, they limit the possible degree 
of focal stretch or magnification. Instead of apply­ing similar limits we carefully blend interfocal 
compression to retain relative ordering of nodes and allow for curvature adjustment to counteract compression 
that has become too Figure 29: Vancouver area with four focal points, dis tofion revealed by shading 
 extreme. As a result, while similar to the morphing based approach [20] in complexity and in providing 
views of multi­focal detail within context, 3DPS offers: a continuous smooth surface between foci where 
spatial relationships amongst the data points do not transpose, freedom of foci size, and foci positioning. 
Also, the choice of focus shape is extended to include concave polygons. 3DPS extends the three-dimensional 
perspective approaches used in [11, 18] for a single focus into a multi-focal tool. Also, rather than 
rely on the specific shape of the distortion or any characteristics of the information, precognitive 
per­ceptual cues are used to reveal the nature of the distortions. We intend to further extend these 
cues with the addition of aerial perspective. Being able to understand the distortion provides knowledge 
about the degree of compression, infor­mation about the original undistorted topology of the graph, and 
the cumulative result of the history of the user s actions, 3DPS also extends user control of the distortion 
through the height, standard deviation, and curvature. Presently these parameters are unconstrained, 
therefore it is possible to create curves that obscure some context. However, just what has been obscured 
is always evident and the actions are reversible. While the use of shading provides instant recognition 
of the patterns of distortion, it causes some problems. Finding the right balance between light and dark 
intensities is difficult to achieve, especially if one wants to have convincing shading both on the screen 
and in print. Also, shading is computa­tionally expensive and noticeably slows interaction, There is 
considerable interest in the application of cognitive science knowledge to interfaces. This stems from 
a desire to make more accessible interfaces but moreover, by creating and testing practical applications 
such as this one, we extend our awareness of the utilization of low level perceptual skills to offset 
cognitive load. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the UIST 95 reviewers for helpful comments
