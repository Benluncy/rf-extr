threats due to resource constraints and the broadcast nature of the transmission medium. Directed diffusion 
protocol is one of the routing protocols for wireless sensor networks that are not designed with security 
in mind and are particularly susceptible to different security attacks. In this paper, a secure routing 
protocol for wireless sensor networks, based on the directed diffusion routing algorithm, is presented. 
The proposed secure routing protocol uses the µTESLA (micro Timed, Efficient, Streaming, Loss-tolerant 
Authentication) broadcasting authentication algorithm in order to authenticate the acknowledgement messages 
sent from the sink to the source nodes for confirming the delivery of the data-event messages. A simulation 
based performance evaluation for the proposed protocol was conducted against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing 
attacks. Simulations show that, compared to the original directed diffusion protocol, the proposed secure 
routing protocol achieved better event-delivery and event-dropping ratios. However, it resulted higher 
cost in the mean dissipated energy and average delay in some situations due to acknowledgement and authentication 
processes for delivered events and also due to the retransmissions of non-acknowledged events. Categories

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). 1. INTRODUCTION Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are known for their reliability, 
accuracy, flexibility, and ease of deployment; as a result they are being widely used for various monitoring 
systems, data collection, and process control applications [1]. Because of their small size, limited 
processing power, and unattended deployment, individual sensor nodes are highly prone to security compromises. 
Therefore, it is important to build security within the network architecture and protocols, so that a 
WSN can successfully operate in the presence of component failures or malicious attacks or both. Many 
routing protocols have been developed for WSNs; directed diffusion is a data-centric routing technique 
for distributed sensing applications in WSNs [2-7]. In directed diffusion, the data collection points, 
commonly called sinks, initiate data dissemination by flooding the query interest in the network to establish 
gradients at each sensor node. These gradients draw the desired sensing data down to each sink, initially 
at a low rate. Based on the delivery quality, the sink selects one specific path to reinforce via a hop-by-hop 
approach. This feedback-based data­quality-control is performed continuously to receive high quality 
of data. Many WSN applications [8] run in untrustworthy environments, which require secure communication 
against different types of attacks [9-13]. However, traditional security protocols [14] are designed 
for resource rich machines with large computation, which are not applicable to WSNs due to resource limitation. 
Secure routing in WSNs presents challenges due to low computing power, small memory, limited bandwidth, 
and especially very limited energy [15]. Many Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which are the result of 
any action that prevents any part of a WSN from functioning correctly or in a timely manner [16], can 
be easily employed against routing in WSNs. Many current routing protocols in WSNs, which are not designed 
with security in mind, are susceptible to some types of DoS attacks, and Directed Diffusion is no exception. 
This paper proposes a secure routing protocol for wireless sensor networks based on the recognized directed 
diffusion routing protocol [3-5]. The proposed secure routing protocol uses the 3. µTESLA PROTOCOL µTESLA 
broadcasting authentication algorithm in order to authenticate the acknowledgement messages sent from 
the sink to the source nodes for confirming the delivery of the data-event messages. It is believed that 
enhancing directed diffusion with the acknowledgement mechanism for data-event delivery at sink will 
be a good contribution and the results can directly benefit networks that use directed diffusion algorithm 
for data delivery. The proposed protocol is implemented in a WSN model and its performance is evaluated 
against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing DoS attacks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 introduces an overview of the directed diffusion routing protocol. Section 3 describes the 
µTESLA (micro Timed, Efficient, Streaming, Loss-tolerant Authentication) protocol. Section 4 presents 
the general structure and phases of the proposed secure routing protocol. Simulation environment and 
attacker model are discussed in section 5. Experimental results are introduced in section 6. Finally, 
Section 7 discusses conclusions, challenges, and future work.  2. DIRECTED DIFFUSION Directed diffusion 
is among the first set of data dissemination protocols developed for WSNs; its scalability and robustness 
have been validated by extensive early studies [2-7]. Directed diffusion routing technique [3-5] is based 
on data-centric routing [7]. Data­centric refers to the fact that in WSNs the most concern is about retrieving 
information matching certain interest queries and very rarely we will be interested in data from a specific 
node. This approach decouples data from the sensor that produced it and unique identification of nodes 
is of secondary importance. Directed diffusion protocol consists of three main phases [3-5], [17]: (1) 
interest propagation phase, (2) path establishment (gradients setup and reinforcement) phase, and (3) 
data-event transmission phase. The interest propagation and path establishment and reinforcement phases 
can be briefly described by considering that the sink node floods the network with an initial interest, 
which specifies a large interval value, to draw the sensing data slowly. Each sensor node then stores 
the interest entry in its cache and sets up a gradient towards its neighbors from which it receives this 
interest. As the interest is propagated throughout the WSN, the gradients from the source back to the 
sink are setup. When the nodes in the specified region (source nodes) receive the interest, they start 
to send sensing data in a low data rate. Intermediate nodes forward the data to the sink along multiple 
paths using the established gradients. When the sink receives a reply for its interest it reinforces 
a path to drawn data from this path. The path is reinforced by reducing the interval of the required 
information (by increasing the data rate). To do so, the sink node unicasts a new interest with a smaller 
interval value to the reinforced node. For the data-event transmission phase, when a source node has 
data from the interest, it sends the data along the reinforced route (high-data rate route). The data 
propagation rules and in-network processing are determined locally [18]. This way, one path with a much 
higher rate than the initial one is set up to draw higher quality of data to the sink. When a reinforced 
path fails to deliver data at the specified rate, the intermediate node on the path that observes such 
degradation reinforces another neighbor for local repair. µTESLA (micro Timed, Efficient, Streaming, 
Loss-tolerant Authentication) protocol [9, 19, 20] is the "micro" version of the TESLA protocol. µTESLA 
protocol provides authenticated broadcast for severely resource-constrained environments. It is designed 
to solve the inadequacies of the TESLA protocol in WSNs by using only symmetric mechanisms for broadcast 
authentication and requiring minimal packet overhead. µTESLA achieves the asymmetry necessary for authenticated 
broadcast and flooding by using delayed key disclosure and one-way key-chains constructed with a publicly 
computable cryptographically secure hash function. µTESLA also requires loose time synchronization [10]. 
Authenticated broadcasting requires asymmetric cryptographic mechanisms that have high computation, communication, 
and storage overhead, which make their usage on resource constrained sensor nodes impractical. µTESLA 
overcomes this problem by introducing asymmetry through a delayed disclosure of symmetric keys, which 
results in an efficient broadcast authentication scheme. µTESLA requires that the base station and the 
nodes are loosely time synchronized, i.e., a node knows the upper bound on the time synchronization error 
with the base station. Figure 1 presents a flowchart for the operation of the µTESLA authentication protocol. 
To send an authenticated packet, the base station simply computes a MAC (Message Authentication Code) 
on the packet with a key that is secret at that point in time. When the node gets the packet, it verifies 
that the corresponding MAC key was not yet disclosed by the base station (based on its loosely synchronized 
clock and because it knows the time schedule at which keys are disclosed). Figure 1. µTESLA authentication 
protocol Since the receiving node is assured that the MAC key is only known by the base station, it 
is assured that no adversary could have altered the packet in transit. So the node stores the packet 
in its buffer. At the time of key disclosure, the base station broadcasts the verification key to all 
receivers. When the node receives the disclosed key, it can easily verify the authenticity of the key 
by checking the security condition. If the key is authentic, the node can now use it to authenticate 
the packet stored in its buffer. Each MAC-key is a key of the key­chain, generated by a publicly known 
one-way function F. To generate the one-way key-chain, the base station randomly chooses a key Kn to 
be the last key of the chain and repeatedly applies the one-way function F: Ki = F(Ki+1), to compute 
all other keys. Each key of the key-chain corresponds to a time interval and all packets sent within 
one time interval are authenticated with the same key.  4. SECURE ROUTING PROTOCOL FOR WIRELESS SENSOR 
NETWORKS The authenticated acknowledgement-based secure routing protocol proposed in this paper can ensure 
both network connectivity and authentication at the same time. That means disseminating high quality 
of sensing data from authenticated nodes to the sink, in the presence of compromised nodes. The proposed 
secure routing protocol inherits many design features from the original directed diffusion protocol and 
defends against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing attacks, and accordingly attains better network 
performance from both routing and security points of view. Broadcasting authentication mechanism depending 
on the procedure of the µTESLA authentication protocol is used by the proposed secure protocol in order 
to authenticate the acknowledgement (ACK) messages sent from the sink to the source nodes for confirming 
the delivery of the data-event messages. Figure 2 illustrates the main phases of the proposed secure 
protocol, which are: (1) secret-key setup and broadcasting phase, (2) interest propagation phase, (3) 
path establishment and reinforcement phase, (4) data-event delivery and authenticated acknowledgement 
phase, and (5) disclosed key and buffered ACK-packets authentication phase. To send an Authenticated 
Acknowledgement (Auth-ACK) packet, the sink simply computes a MAC (Message Authentication Code) on the 
acknowledgement (ACK) packet with a key (Ki) that is secret at that point in time (Ti). When the source 
node gets the Auth-ACK packet, it can verify that the corresponding MAC key was not yet disclosed by 
the sink (based on its loosely synchronized clock and because it knows the time schedule at which keys 
are disclosed). Since the receiving source node is assured that the MAC key is only known by the sink, 
it is assured that no adversary could have altered the packet in transit. So, the node stores the received 
Auth-ACK packets in a buffer. At the time of key disclosure (Tj), the sink sends the verification key 
(Kj) to all source nodes. When the node receives the disclosed key, it can easily verify the authenticity 
of the key by checking the security condition. If the key is authentic, the node can now use it to authenticate 
the ACK packets stored in its buffer.  5. SIMULATION MODEL The proposed protocol is implemented using 
C++ code. The main goal of conducting this performance evaluation study was to evaluate the performance 
of the proposed secure routing protocol, under normal conditions (without any DoS attacks) and against 
the existence of both black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing DoS attacks, and to compare its performance 
with the performance of the original directed diffusion protocol. Four evaluating metrics were selected; 
namely, mean dissipated energy, average delay, distinct event delivery ratio, and event packet dropping 
ratio. x Mean dissipated energy: measures the ratio of total dissipated energy per node in the network 
to the number of distinct events seen by sinks. x Average delay: measures the average one-way end-to­end 
delay observed between transmitting an event and receiving it at each sink including retransmission, 
buffering, and authentication. x Distinct event delivery ratio: the ratio of the number of distinct events 
received at the sink to the number originally sent by source nodes. x Event packet dropping ratio: the 
ratio of the total number of dropped event data packets, due to DoS­attacks or lack of paths to the sink, 
to the number of originally sent event data packets by source nodes.  In order to study the performance 
of the proposed protocol as a function of network size, four sensor fields of different sizes, ranging 
from 25 to 100 nodes in increments of 25 nodes, were generated. Each sensor field was generated by randomly 
placing the nodes in a 100mx100m square. One stationary sink sits in the center of the field at location 
(50, 50). Sensor nodes have initial positions at the beginning of the simulation, then, they moved according 
to a random-step-mobility model. Each node has a radio range of 30m. Energy consumption model for radio 
communication in simulations follows the Berkeley motes [21], which consume (0.025 mJoule) for transmitting 
and (0.0186 mJoule) for receiving a single byte. The event-area (phenomena region) has been chosen to 
be in 2 rectangles, as shown in figure 3. Distance-varying bit-rate data sources were being used for 
simulations. That is the bit rate of each source varies with the distance between this data source sensor 
node and the destination sink node (distance-varying bit rate). The DoS attack is assumed to take place 
after the attacking node received the interest. Exploratory interests were initially broadcasted by the 
sink with a rate of one exploratory-interest per second. Interests with new tasks were periodically broadcasted 
then refreshed (updated) by the sink node every 100 milliseconds (interest interval) and last for 500 
milliseconds. Each sensor node has an interest-cache with a size of 4 interest entries. The data-events 
have 5 retransmission trials for each data-event as a retransmission limit. The sizes of interest packet, 
data-event packet, and Auth-ACK packet are 36 bytes, 64 bytes, and 14 bytes, respectively. Each time 
interval (Ii) lasts for 100 milliseconds and the disclosure delay time is 150 milliseconds. Each Auth-ACK 
packet lasts for 10 milliseconds then expires. This time also represents the acknowledgement duration 
the source node waits before re-sending another data­event through an alternative route to the sink. 
Each simulation runs 5 times and the result shown is an average of these runs. Two DoS attacks, namely, 
black hole attack and acknowledgement-spoofing attack, will be simulated in the attacker model against 
the WSN in order to evaluate the proposed protocol's performance. In a black hole attack [10, 11], an 
attacker drops the incoming packets from its previous-hop neighbor nodes. In order to remain unnoticed, 
the adversary keeps sending self­generated packets only; thus, the malicious node may appear normal to 
its next-hop neighbors, which makes it hard to figure out the cause of disconnection from a certain group 
of nodes to the sink node. In the acknowledgement-spoofing attack [10], an adversary can spoof acknowledgements 
for packets addressed to neighboring nodes in order to convince the sender that the transmitted packet 
has delivered for its destination node or that a weak link is strong. The base station (sink node) is 
assumed to be secure and trusted. Sensor nodes are (unlike the sink node) not trusted. This is a common 
assumption in WSNs [9,10,21] because it is relatively easy for an adversary to capture and compromise 
sensor nodes. Figure 3 shows the simulated environment for the 100-nodes WSN model.  6. EXPERIMENTAL 
RESULTS 6.1 Mean Dissipated Energy For the proposed protocol, without any attacks, it dissipates more 
energy compared to the energy dissipated by the directed diffusion protocol due to the authentication 
process accomplished by the source nodes, for the buffered Auth-ACK packets, on receiving the disclosed 
key of the previous time interval after certain disclosure delay time. With black hole and the acknowledgement-spoofing 
attacks taking place, the mean dissipated energy will increase due to the retransmission of nondelivered 
and consequently non­acknowledged data packets, because of attacks or path failure, by source nodes through 
alternative reinforced routes to the sink, instead of the failed original reinforced routes that pass 
through the attacker nodes, the case that results in more dissipated energy.  6.2 Average Delay For 
the proposed protocol compared to the directed diffusion, the main reason for the increase in the average 
delay is the time consumed in the acknowledgement process, by delivering Auth-ACK packets from the sink 
to source nodes confirming the delivery of data-event packets, and the acknowledgement waiting time, 
which is the time that source node waits till receiving ACK packet from the sink for the sent data-event 
packet. That is with addition to the time consumed in the authentication process for the buffered Auth-ACK 
in the source nodes after waiting for the disclosure delay time. With black hole and the acknowledgement-spoofing 
attacks taking place, the average delay for the proposed secure protocol is higher than the average delay 
under normal conditions (without any attacks). That is due to the retransmission of the nondelivered 
(falsely acknowledged) data packets to the sink through alternative routes after waiting for the disclosure 
delay time. 6.3 Distinct Event Delivery Ratio Assuming a congestion-free network, the proposed protocol 
achieves around 90%-98% delivery ratio for the data events sent from the source nodes to the sink as 
the network size increases. However, in some situations, the data-packets may not be delivered to the 
sink node because the source node has no route to the sink, the case that decreases the event delivery 
ratio even in the absence of any attacks. Retransmission of the non­acknowledged data-packets, due to 
data-events dropping by attacker nodes or due to path failure, also allows the proposed protocol to exhibit 
very good results concerning the distinct event delivery ratio. For the proposed protocol with black 
hole and the acknowledgement-spoofing attacks, the achieved event delivery ratio will be slightly lower 
than the delivery ratio achieved by the same protocol under normal conditions. That is because in some 
situations there are no available alternative routes that are not passing through the attacker nodes, 
especially in small size networks, to be used for re-sending the nondelivered data-events to the sink. 
 Figure 3. Simulation environment  6.4 Event Packet Dropping Ratio For the directed diffusion protocol, 
the event dropping ratio increases dramatically as a result for the black hole attack against data-event 
messages sent from source nodes toward the sink, compared to the dropping ratio achieved by the same 
protocol without any attacks. On the other hand, retransmission of the non­acknowledged data packets, 
due to data-events dropping by attacker nodes or due to path failure, allows the proposed protocol to 
exhibit the lowest event dropping ratio, under normal conditions. For the proposed protocol with black 
hole and the acknowledgement-spoofing attacks, the event dropping ratio will be higher than the dropping 
ratio achieved by the same protocol under normal conditions. That is also due to absence of available 
alternative routes that are not passing through the attacker nodes to be used for re-sending the nondelivered 
data events to the sink, especially in small size networks. Table 1 summarizes the results of performance 
evaluation, with and without the existence of DoS attacks, for the proposed secure routing protocol against 
the original directed diffusion routing protocol. Table 1. Performance evaluation for the proposed secure

protocol for wireless sensor networks based on the directed diffusion routing algorithm. Simulation results 
show that the storage space required increases with the increase in the number of nodes in the network. 
The proposed secure routing protocol inherits many design features from the original directed diffusion 
protocol with addition to authenticating data event delivery acknowledgement messages, and accordingly 
attains better network performance from both routing and security points of view. Simulations show that 
the proposed secure routing protocol attains a very good performance against black hole and acknowledgement-spoofing 
attacks by having a high delivery ratio and a low dropping ratio for data-events. But, that very good 
performance has been achieved with the cost of high delay and dissipated energy in some situations due 
to the retransmission of the non delivered data events to the sink node. In future work, we plan to 
use a simulation model containing obstacles or interference problems, or providing diversity in the capabilities 
of each sensor node in the provided simulations. 8. REFERENCES <RefA>[1] <SinRef><author>Akyildiz, I.F., </author><author>Su, W., </author><author>Sankarasubramaniam,
