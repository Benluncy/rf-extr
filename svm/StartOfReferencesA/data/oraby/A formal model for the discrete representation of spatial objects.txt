 Keywords: spatial databases, data models, spatial relations. ABSTRACT In this paper we define a formal 
model for the discrete representation of spatial objects and characterize its properties. The model and 
its manipulation primitives are based only on set theory and do not use any metric- based concept. A 
general characterization for containment and intersection relations is given. The model is based on 
a mapping from spatial objects to their representations as sets of points of Z 2 such that queries on 
spatial objects can be answered by applying simple set-theoretic primitives to their corresponding discrete 
representations. The mapping makes reference to a suitable topology whose underlying set is a canonical 
decomposition of the real plane in square cells. But the introduced model keep its properties under every 
homeomorphic topological space such that its underlying set is a countable partition of the plane whose 
cells are simply connected.  1. INTRODUCTION The definition of a formal framework for the representation

97 0002 3.50 !44 their relations is a key issue in the theory of spatial databases. Since we want to 
use computing devices to represent and manipulate spatial objects and their relations it is of the greatest 
importance to focus on finite formalizations. In this paper we are therefore concerned with the definition 
of a theory which models spatial relations among geographical object and is, at the same time, based 
on finite and discrete representations of spatial objects. Many different models for spatial objects 
and relations have been introduced in the literature. Among the most widely known there is the Egenhofer 
and Franzosa's 4- intersection model [EF91 ] and its extensions ([Her91 ], [CDO93], [ES93]), all based 
on point-set topology. Other interesting models formalizing spatial relations are based on simplicial 
complexes ([EFJ89], ['Wor92]) or on partial orders or on a combination of them [KEG]. Considering finite 
representation of spatial objects, Guibas, Salesin and Stolfi defined Epsilon-Geometry [GSS89, GSS93], 
which allows to carry out exact geometric computations even when only inaccurate primitives are available. 
This approach, while very good in dealing with building accurate discrete representation of real objects 
does not explicitly address issues of spatial relations. Greene and Yao [GY86] introduced a computational 
geometry framework for the topologically correct computation of intersection (discrete) points in a set 
of line segments whose endpoints have discrete coordinates. A completely different approach was taken 
by Giiting and Schneider [GS93]. They introduced the concept of Realm (i.e., a set of points and non-intersecting 
lines over a discrete domain)which allows to model spatial relations through an algebraic approach. Discrete 
representations at the Realm level are derived from real objects by means of computational geometry primitives 
which take into account rounding problems. Representations at the Realm level are then manipulated through 
a very clean algebraic interface, where spatial relations are defined by means of a algebraic specifications. 
But the introduction of an intermediate level, while allowing a very good formalization of spatial relations 
and manipulations, hides the true relations between objects in the real world and their counterparts 
in the model. In this paper we address these issues by defining a formal model for spatial objects and 
relations and characterizing its properties. We have already introduced in [CNT96] a discrete representation 
for spatial relations which allows to test containment and intersection relations among convex polygons. 
We defined a topology preserving mapping from the set of convex polygons to a discrete space. Here we 
extend and refine that approach. Objects we consider are arbitrary polygons and lines whose vertices 
are points with discrete-valued coordinates. The discrete space we use as basis for our framework is 
a countable set of points whose coordinates are suitably taken from the set of rational numbers. We define 
a correspondence between this discrete space and a partition of the continuous real plane in squares. 
This specific partition is chosen only for ease of formalization, since our results hold for any decomposition 
of the real plane that is a partition in cells such that the cells are the underlying set of a topological 
space homeomorphic to the one we introduce. The manipulation primitives introduced in the model are purely 
topological and based on set-theory, without using any concept based on metrics. Thus we are able to 
give a finite characterization of each of the three basic relative positions of spatial objects (namely: 
containment, intersection, and disjointness). These are the three fundamental relations to be managed 
by any efficient organization of spatial data. The paper is structured as it follows. In section 2 we 
introduce the topological space used for the discrete framework and the mapping between it and real objects. 
In section 3 we characterize the containment relation between polygons. Section 4 completes the characterization 
by studying the intersection relation. Section 5 address generalization issues and, finally, section 
6 contains conclusive remarks. 2. BASIC DEFINITIONS In this section we introduce the topological space 
used for the discrete representation of objects and the one-to- one mapping between it and objects in 
the reality. Let N, Z, Q, R denote the sets of, respectively, natural, integer, rational, and real numbers. 
Each set is taken with its usual total order. Let Qa={pi~ Q [pi=Pi.l+A, 0<A<I, A~ Q, i~ Z}. Without loss 
of generality, we can assume p0=0. We note that on Qa a successor function succ: Q,~---~Qa can be defined. 
Given apiE Qa we let succ(pi)=pi+l. Let ]a,b[, with a<b, denote an open interval in Qa, that is ]a,b[ 
= {p I a<p<b, a,b,p~ Qa}. Let Gt~=QaXQA and let (Ga,Ta) be the topological space whose open sets are 
generated by the following basis Ba={ ]a,b[ x ]c,d[ la,b,c,d~Qa}. Let T~ T a. We denote with C(T) the 
complement in Ga of T, i.e. the set C(T)= Ga\T. We denote with T the closure of T, i.e. the intersection 
of all closed sets I of (Gzx,Ta) containing T. We denote with bT the boundary of T, i.e. the set aT=TnC(T). 
DEFINITION 1: Let T~ T a. T is called canonical if T={t l,,. ,]vi,ai+l [ × ]bj,bj+l [ [ (ai,bj)~ Ga)- 
T is called degenerate if {p [pc T}=O. @ Note that a canonical open set is always degenerate. DEFINITION 
2: Let x~ Gzx. we denote with U x the family of open sets of T a containing x. We call U x = (~ V the 
pointed ndighbourhood of x. @ Ve U x DEFINITION 3: Let x=(xl,x2) and Y=(Yl,Y2) belong to Ga. we say x 
is adjacent to y if (Xl=SUCC(yl) v yl=succ(xl)) ^ (x2=Y2) or if (x2=succ(y2) v y2=succ(x2)) ^ (xl=Yl). 
@ DEFINITION4: Let 7={xl, x2 ..... Xk}, k>2, be a finite set of points of Ga, such that xi-i and xi are 
adjacent for i=2,3 ..... k, and xi:g:x j for i~:j. We say y is a chain. @ DEFINITION 5: Let A be a set 
of points of Ga. We say A is connected if for each couple of distinct points x and y belonging to A a 
chain 7={xt, x2 ..... Xk} exists such that xl=x and xk=y. @ DEFINITION 6: Let ~-={xl, x2 ..... xk), k>_4,

partition in disjoint sets induced on R 2 by GA- Such a partition is denoted R 2 in the following. 3.1.

(ai,bj)E GA}E R~. We say (ai,bj) is the base point of q, and we let hbp(q)=ai and vbp(q)=bj. @ In [CNT96] 
we characterized containment between convex polygons in R 2 in terms of the containment between open 
sets of the topological space (Ga,Ta). We considered in [CNT96] only convex polygons such It is naturally 
defined a one-to-one function bp: that o(.)'is loop-connected. R2"~ Ga that associates at each q of R

R~ with the topology 'T~' defined as the inverse image of T a under bp. To obtain T a' we can consider 
its basis B a" obtained as the We now briefly recall definitions and results from [CNT96]. Afterwards 
we give the treatment for non- convex polygon and in the final section we generalize to polygons such 
that o(.) is not loop-connected. inverse image of BA under bp. An element of BA' is therefore an open

The containment between two polygons in R z is Also, it is possible to define a mapping between R~ equivalent 
to the containment of their skeletons. and Z z, namely T:R,~Z 2, that satisfies the following conditions: 
THEOREM 1 [CNT96]: Lct A. Be E. Then AC_EB iff G(A )C_GaCy( B). @ 146 1. a=T(p)and b=T(q) are horizontally 
(vertically) adjacent iff p and q are horizontally (vertically) adjacent; 2. a is on the right (on the 
left) of b iffp is on the right (on the left) of q. 3. a is above (below) b iffp is above (below) q. 
 Let P(S) denote the power set of set S. Let us take R~ and Z 2 with their respective topologies, 'T 
a' and T(Z2). Note that T is open I. Moreover, T is one-to- one, since T(p)~:T(q) iffp¢-q. THEOREM2 [CNT96]: 
Let A,Be ~E. Then Ac_TB iff T( bpl ( o(A ) ) )cz2T ( bp-t ( o( B) ) ). @ The above theorem then allows 
us to reduce testing of containment between convex polygons of R z tO the testing of set containment 
between their correspondent sets of points of Z 2. 3.2. Relations between line segments We now study 
relations between line segments with a twofold aim. First to be able to generalize to non-convex polygons 
results obtained in the previous section, and second to prepare the way for the characterization of the 
intersection relation between arbitrary polygons. To obtain this we adopt a formal framework that is 
different from the one we have used in [CNT96]. Let .L be the set of line segments of R 2 whose endpoints 
belong to Ga. We denote with 1~ the infinite line corresponding to a line segment le £. We denote + with 
l~and l~,r~espectively the right and left (according to some arbitrarily chosen direction for l~) open 
halfplane of R 2 defined by/~,. In this sub-section it is always l,l' e L. DEFINITION 11: The set .'7~l,~,)={xe 
~a I qYe~xx : (ye 1 + ^ xe l~) v (ye l~ ^ xe 1~,)} is called the set of the near points of 1oo. ® DEFINITION 
12: Let (a,b) and (c,d) be the endpoints of l. The set F(l)={(x,y)~ N(loo) I min(a,c )< x< max(a,c) ^ 
min(b,d)<y<max(b,d)} is called the set of convexification points of 1. @ Note that if line segment 1 
is horizontal or vertical then the set ~1) is empty. DEFINITION 13: We call skeleton of l the set o(l)=uxUx 
for all xe 1~ ~.~. The set fl(l)=o(l].o ~r(l) is called the envelope of/. The subset of if(l) that is 
I A map from a topological space X to another topological space Y is open iff the tmage of each open 
set of is an open set. + contained m loo (resp. l~) is called the right (resp. left) envelope of l and 
is denoted ff+(l) (resp. f-(/)). @ Note that the envelope of a segment line is a closed set and is always 
loop-connected. We now characterize the intersection relation between line segments in terms of relations 
between their envelopes. FACT 1: If ff(1)nff(l')=O then l~l'=~. @ When the intersection between envelopes 
is not empty additional conditions are necessary since in this case line segments may have no intersection 
at all. If the intersection between envelopes contains both a point x of G^ and the closure of Ux then 
the two line segments intersect at x. But this sufficient condition is not necessary since two line segments 
may intersect in a point y not belonging to Ga. To characterize these two different cases of intersection 
between line segments we introduce the following notation. When the intersection between envelopes is 
not empty additional conditions are necessary since in this case line segments may have no intersection 
at all. If the intersection between envelopes contains both a point x of ~a and the closure of Ux then 
the two line segments intersect at x. But this su;[icient condition is not necessary since two line seunents 
may intersect in a point y not belonging to ~A. To characterize these two different cases of intersection 
between line segments we introduce the following notation. I We let Y(l,l')= { xe GAIUxC_ff(l)~ff(l 
") }. Informally speaking X(l,l') is the set of grid points whose closed pointed neighbourhood belongs 
to the envelope of both segment lines. We now introduce the notation int(l,l') which is true if and only 
if the following predicate is true: (3 xe a(l), ye ~(l) [ xe if-(13 ^ ye ff+(l') ) ^ (3 we ft(13, ze 
c(l') [ weft-(/) ^ zeff+(/)). Informally speaking the boolean predicate int(l,l') tells, when true, if 
both the two segment lines have at least one of their skeleton points in each the open halfplanes defined 
by the other segment line. In figure 2 various possibilities for intersection between envelopes are shown: 
note that in case (A) int(l,l') is true while in case (B) and (C) int(l,l') is false. Points belonging 
to 9~lo.) are shown as small full circles, those belonging also to .'Rl) are within a square. 47 ................................................................................................................

a contradiction. (ONLYIF) The implication X(l,l'));~O ~ Inl'~f3 follows by the definition of X, the remaining 
one follows by the definition of int(l,l'). @ 3.3. Containment between arbitrary polygons In this sub-section 
we extend the results of subsection 3.1 by considering also relations between arbitrary (i.e.. not necessarily 
convex) polygons. For the sake of simplicity, we again first consider only convex polygons such that 
~(-) is loop-connected, and we shall later remove this restriction. To investigate containment relations 
between arbitrary polygons it is necessary to use the characterization of relations between line segments 
defined in the previous sub-section. In fact, it is not possible, working only with skeletons to determine 
containment. This is due to the fact that a convex polygon is uniquely identified by its skeleton while 
this is not true for concave polygons. Even if the number of sides of a concave polygon is known this 
is not sufficient to uniquely identify the polygon from its skeleton (see figure 3). Let 'E' be the set 
of all polygons in R 2 whose vertices belongs to GA- In this sub-section it is always A,Be ~E', le .L, 
l" a side of A, and l" a side of B. LEMMA 2: If int(l,l') then l ~E ,A. PROOF: If int(l,l') is true then 
lnl';~. Then we have two cases: either l has at least one endpoint outside A or I has both the endpoints 
inside A. In the first case the thesis is trivially true. In the second case, since l" has to intersect 
some side of A, the only possibility is that l intersects an even number of sides of A. It easy to check 
that this may happen only when A is concave and l is not completely contained in A @ !48 ....... X

If A~ ~E' has a skeleton whose closure is not loop-connected, than we introduce a generalized skeleton, 
which includes a(A) and is loop-connected. DEFINITION 16: The generalized skeleton of A, denoted ~'(A),

@ Note that if the skeleton of a polygon is already loop- connected then the generalized skeleton coincides 
with the skeletons itself. Let A and B be two polygons represented by means of generalized skeletons. 
In this case also, if the intersection between their generalized skeletons is empty, we cannot conclude 
that A and B are disjoint. It easy to prove that the interection relation is completely characterized 
by theorem 6. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have defined and characterized a topology preserving mapping 
from extended spatial objects to a discrete space. This allow us to correctly answer queries about topological 
relations of containment and intersection by manipulating the discrete representations of spatial objects: 
we have therefore extended to polygons the approach of Greene and Yao [GY86]. We are thus able to identify 
each of the three basic relative positions of spatial objects (namely: containment, intersection, and 
disjointness), which are fundamental for any efficient organization of spatial data. We now sketch some 
of the most interesting directions for future research we are currently investigating. First of all, 
the study of computability and computional complexity issues relative to our model. Secondly, a formal 
characterization of relations among spatial objects whose endpoints are not bound to be points of GA 
and among spatial objects which are not simply connected. Thirdly, a study of how our model characterizes 
other spatial relations and, more in general, supports spatial reasoning. Finally, an in-depth analysis
