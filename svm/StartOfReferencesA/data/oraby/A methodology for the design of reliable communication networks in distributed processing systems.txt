Besharatian M/A COM RESEARCH CENTER 1350 Piccard Dr , Rockville. Maryland. 2~85~ ABSTRACT The combined 
problem of the communication network desiqn and resource allocation is studied for Disributed Data Processinq 
(DDP~ networks. The reliability measure for a distributed data processing system is used in order to 
enhance network reliability, A model is proposed to determine an optimal DDP network and to allocate 
resources that maximize the reliability measure of the network, The model takes into consideration network 
topology, resource avaliability and channel capacity. It is shown that the model may be represented by 
a linear proqramming model. INTRODUCTION A geographically distributed orqanization often has a need 
for a unified information system that enhances proper and efficient management of its resources. This 
usually needs a set of geographically distributed computer systems that interact through a communication 
network [1.2.3.4], Tn such a case the following questions usually arise: i) How should the resources 
be allocated across the computer sites? Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material

be the size of a computer system that will be installed at each organizational site? In this paper we 
attempt to answer these questions. A framework for an evaluation tool is introduced that [4.5.6]: i) 
Can be used to compare alternative distributed data processing systems with respect to reliability problems; 
 2) Provide a means to use optimization methods in an iterative desiqn improvement process; and 3) Provide 
a tool to use sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of changes in system parameters. The formulation 
of the reliability measure for a distributed data processing system is the main focus of this paper [7,8.9]° 
A reliability index is defined for a potential path between any pair of nodes in the system, The expected 
reliabilitv index is defined for every individual pair of nodes and will be formulated to represent the 
reliability measure of the system, Finally, a set of properties will be presented to justify the use 
of this &#38;#169; 1983 ACM 0-89791-113-X/83/0010/0131500.75 factor as a measure of reliability. The 
reliability measure completely provides the salient information about the network [i~,i11. Hence, for 
the first time it is computationally feasible to study the effects of demand (load), links reliability, 
degradation of capacity, and other factors upon the ability of network system to provide the desired 
level of performance. determine which sites to interconnect ~we will address this problem in our desian 
of the network topology [14]), The second subproblem is to determine the capacity of each communication 
channel. This will be referred to as the channel capacity allocation problem° The objectives of this 
work then are as follows: To define the reliability problem, it is necessary to develop expressions 
for the reliability measures, link communications capacity, site capacity, and request volume [12.]31, 
The reliability measure is an objective function, while the remaining three constitute constraints° 
A reliability measure can be uenerated by taking the expectation of a reliability index. defined for 
each Pair of nodes which depends on thenumber of messages issued from source to destination sites, and 
the weiqhted reliability factor between those sites. This measure provides a quantitative approach to 
measuring the reliability of a distributed data processing system that depends on the network architecture, 
data requirements, and processing distribution. The quantitative network evaluation permits a comparison 
of the performance of different network architectures with respect to the reliability measure. An example 
of a distributed data processing network is shown in Figure io 15 To find a solution to the communication 
network design. 25 To find a solution to the resource allocation at each site. 3) To find a solution 
to the channel capacity allocation. 4~ To investigate the effect of the resource and channel capacities 
on the overall desiqn. 2. THE MODEL The problem formulation and the derivation of expressions for the 
problem model are discussed briefly below. 2 i~ PROBLEM FORMULATION The problem addressed is formulated 
as follows: GIVEN:  The problem of the distribution of o A set of n qeographically the resources (question 
15 and the size distributed computer sites ( of computer system at each site NI. N 2, N3,.., Nn5 (question 
35 is known as the resource allocation. The communication network o A set of service requests (R I, design 
problem(question 25 can, R 2, R 3, ...... Rn) therefore, be broken down into two subproblems~ The first 
problem is to o A set of available computer system capacities IS1, $2 , $3,. .... Sn). o The set of 
available channel capacities (AI.A2 .....Xk)O  o Site and channel failure probabilities (h). The parameter 
h is noted as the reliability index.   FIND: o The allocation of the communication channel capacities° 
The set of channel apacitv allocation variables is : f = {fk' k= i, 2 ....., k} where fk is: n n 
p=P.. IJ fk = I .. iji=~ j=l Number mPij is the portion of traffic (or number of messages) issued at 
the ith site, passed throughout the path p and processed at the jth site.  Number fk (Ri*mPij) is the 
portion of mPij which is passed throughout the kth channel° The ratio of fk/Ak gives the utilization 
of channel kth.  o The allocation of computer system capacities. The set of resource capacity allocation 
variables is : C s = fcj, i = i, 2,..., nI,  where n p,P (2) C = | ij J i=1 Integer Cj is the traffic 
(or number of messages) issued at the ith site and processed at the jth site°  The objective is to maximize 
the reliability measure which is the sum of the followinq : n n  z = max {1 ~'-~j~-'~ d i j } (3) j=l 
i=1 Where dij is called the weighted reliability index between the ith and jth sites. The value of dij 
is qiven by: dij = 'l m P. hP.. (4) ,j o il f.. Where mPij is the portion of the traffic {or number 
of messages)issued at the ith site, passed throughout the pth path and processed at jth site. hPij 
is the reliability index between the ith site and the jth site when path p is considered= Pij is the 
set of possible paths between the ith and jth sites° FI s. I FO~ NODESDIS~IB~IONDATA ~ROCESS~G NETWO~ 
2.2, DERIVATION OF EXPRESSIONS FOR THE PROBLEM MODEL Expressions for the problem model (Equation 1 
to 4) are now derived in terms of the reliability index, and sets of C s, ~, R, and f. 2 2 -1 - ISSUED 
REQUEST CONSTRAINTS The number of messages issued per unit of time at site i will be distributed into 
the processing centers located at different sites to be processed. This distribution will be represented 
by: D nl E mij = ~.~ m~P i" j = 1 (5) j=l j=l for PEP.. Zl Where mij is the portion of traffic for number

CENTER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS The capacity of a Drocessinq center is defined as the maximum number of 
messages that will be processed per unit of time at the processing center ( Fig. 2.b). The capacity 
constraint is given by: cj = n ~ = 1 ~PiJ(R|mP j ) < - S j (6] where sj is the maximum number of messages 
processed by processing center at site j DeE unit of time. R i is the total number of messages issued 
per unit of time at site is 2 2 ~ CHANNEL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS Since each channel in the communication 
network is considered to be a separate server, the notation Ak is adapted as the maximum number of 
messages per unit of time that travel over the kth channel or line. We should recognize the fact that 
the routing procedure operating upon the message traffic will determine the relation between the set 
(Ak} and the set ~mPij} in any real network. These two quantities are related by: n n (7]  i=1 j=l 
[i~j } for PEP.. q Where fk (Rimij) indicates the portion of the number of messages which travel over 
the kth channel, issued at site i and processed at site j. The routing procedure will indicate function

the total weighted differences given by Z (Eq. 3), is defined as the objective function: ,. ,, =m.x 
'EEE '"P° m p L i=1 j=l L i=1 j=1 i j i j  for all rnij for all mij and PEPij (s] In trying to maximize 
the total weighted differences (Z), the designer should give the highest flow assignment to the channel 
with the hiqhest reliability index. Furthermore, let Bst denote the event that the path p exists between 
site s and site t~ The following definition is given by Barllow[12-13]  P [B P st = ~ = h P : E [B pSt 
st] (9) where BPst is defined as: ,i if path p between site s and site t is operational BPst = if path 
p between site s and site t is not operational  E(BPst) denotes the expected value of the BPst , and 
hPst denotes the reliability function of path p in the network for the source s and destination t. 
Reliability index is therefore, expressed in terms of the site and channel failure probability [9,11,15]o 
 A design process to solve the problem formulated in the previous section is now presented. The main 
part of the optimization problem consists of an iteration process on the network data flow mPij. The 
design process consists of an optimum algorithm whose input/output description is shown in figure 3. 
The output of OPTIMUM is as follows: o The optimal value for reliability measure Z~  o The optimal 
resource allocation:  Csopt = {Cjopt, j= i. 2,,.~,n} where Cjopt is the value of required resource 
capacity at site j found in the optimal solution. o The optimal channel capacity allocation: Fkopt 
= ~fk" k = i, 2,...,K} where fkopt is the value of required channel capacity on channel k found in 
the optimal solution.  The Algorithm OPTIMUM is now described. It consists of algorithms LOC-RAs DECOMP, 
INIT-M and ITER-Mo Figure 4 shows the processing escription of the OPTIMUM alqorithm. Network Characteristics:

reliability index at site i satisfies the Condition of (10~, then we will conclude that the processing 
 center at site i gives' the first priority to those messages which are issued at site i. This result 
is shown by: M = min [1 or Si/Ri]i i  Algorithm LOC-RA will check condition (10~ for each sitep and 
will find the local resource allocation in case of satisfying condition (i~).  3-2 ALGORITHM DECOMP 
 In the same way as we did for algorithm LOC-RA bv using the properties 136 of Linear Programming and 
the result of property 2 fsee Appendix A); we may conclude that under condition (ii) a new initial resource 
allocation is obtained. Therefore, the processinq center located at sub-network N1 must provide the maximum 
service to the messages that are issued in the sub-network NI; and the same conclusion is true about 
sub- network N2. The results can be presented in the following form: The smalles~ [The smallest] element 
of lelelement of I ~ [I/R I] [HI1] J L[I/R 2] [H221 J (I I) [The largest'1 ~e largest ] element of

M  tz2 = mini1 or S t2 /Rtt Algorithm DECOMP will check condition (iI~ for any sub-network which satisfies 
the requirements for property 2, and will find the initial resource allocation for that sub-network. 
 3.3 ALGORITHM INIT-M This algorithm finds initial value of M i (the initial feasible solution for linear 
programming~o The output from algorithm INIT-M is the first solution which satisfies all onstraintso 
We may apply the phase-I of the simplex alqorithm for INIT-M, 3.4. ALGORITHM ITER-M The phase-II of 
the simplex method can be used here, This algorithm maintains the value of reliability measure corresponding 
to the optimal solution found so far. It decides that the iteration process has ended wherever the optimality 
conditions are satisfied~ 4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The discussion in previous sections has emphasized 
on the evaluation and resource allocation of certain network topologies, after the values of hij, R 
i and Sj were obtained for each network system° The "R i and Sj values are the responsibility of the 
user and can be indicated by the customer as to how these values may be specified~ To date; however, 
the selection of the hij values has not been addressed. How does the designer produce an optimal or at 
least a good allocation of available resources, subject to the constraints of the specification and system 
architecture? The objective as discussed in previous sections is, therefore: to maximize the reliability 
measure of the distribution data processing network which is subject to the data flow and system specification. 
When studying a system using a linear programming model technique, the sensitivity analysis can be used 
to acquire additional processinq centers; and to determine which resourcs to acquire at what capacity, 
The linear programming model not only determines an optimum solution to implement, but becomes a tool 
for optimal planning and design. By applying the sensitivity analysis, we want to know how far the input 
parameter values ~i~e., Ri, Sj, or hii) can vary without causing violent changes in a compound optimal 
solution or the composition of a basic set. SIMILAR PROBLEMS The other network design problems can 
be posed as linear programs similar to problem model(Eq. 8). These are problems in which data between 
every pair of nodes in the network have to be transmitted to minimize average weighted delay. Applications 
are also found in network cost problems. Which deal with the problems of determining the minimum cost 
of data transmissioh within the data communication networks~ Flow assiqnment and optimum routing problems 
are also similar problems that can be posed as linear programs similar to the problem model, which deal 
with the problem of determining the minimum data flow to provide an optimum set of routes for the data 
transmission within the DDP system. 6-CONCLUSION The problem of the combined communication network 
design and resource allocation for distributed data processing system was addressed, The reliability 
modeling tool which is presented in this paper, allows network designers to evaluate various network 
configurations during the design phase, In this model we choose data flow as a weighting factor to objective 
function because it relates our model directly to the first g0al in network data communication which 
is data transmission, A model was described which provided a framework and mathematical model for the 
computation of the reliability measure. This reliability measure was presented as a function of data 
flow [m). reliability index {h). channel capacity {A). and information processing center capacities (R 
s S). This mathematical model dealt with identifying the best data flow assianment whose objective was 
 maximizing the reliability measure,  A desian methodoloqv to solve the model was then presented, A 
Linear Programming rLP) model for the problem was presented~ Several general algorithms were introduced 
to decrease the size of the problem modelc In a real network, the cost of transmission and the delay 
time will be increased by increasing the distance between sites. Consequently~ the first priority of 
processing should be given to the local requests. Therefore. in a real case. each network should have 
a more reliable processing capability for local requests versus non-local requests. That is to say. in 
a real case, the decompositon algorithm and other relevant methods will be very helpful in reducing the 
size of the problem model. In linear programming problem requires the examination of all minimal paths 
in the qraph between every pair of nodes° The solution of the problem model just mentioned is not computationally 
feasible for large networks. In a related study, two procedures for reducing the number of variables 
in linear proqramming was suggested based on the fact that the few minimal paths between any pair of 
nodes with the largest reliability index will 138 exist in the optimal solution [7].  REFERENCES
