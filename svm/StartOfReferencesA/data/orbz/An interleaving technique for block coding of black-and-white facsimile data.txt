 AN INTERLEAVING TECHNIQUE FOR BLOCK CODING OF BLACK-AND-WHITE FACSIMILE DATA D. Weifang Doong, Huizhu 
Lu, G.E. Hedrick Oklahoma State University Dept. of Computer Science A new method of one-dimensional 
compression called Interleaved Block Coding (IBC), is presented. It features a fixed-rate output exhibiting 
strong noise immunity. The coding method works well irrespective of whether the image is largely-white 
or largely-black; and the fixed-rate output exhibita a strong immunity to transmission errors. The method 
aiso encodes biock-pairs of binary image data without the need for codebooks. By providing a sufficient 
coding field, a lossleas form of coding is possible. For better noise immunity, a lossy form of codii 
is preferred with encoding distortion taking the form of lost black elements, In the case of distortion, 
a copy procedure based on the color correlation between two connected pixels has been found to be effective 
for reducing the level of black element loss. Aiso, the results of simulation for 8-pixel blocks showed 
a high degree of intelligibility being maintained in the decoded image after exposure to random transmission 
errors whose average rate may be as high as one in 32 bits. INTRODUCTION For efficient coding, there 
are aiways two fundrunentai concepts involved in converting information stored on paper to a bit­mapped 
electronic format. One is image-data compression, which reduces the amount of redundant data required 
either to transmit or to store an image. The other concept is immunity to transmission errors, which 
always are caused by channel noise. A huge number of efficient coding methods for black-white images 
have been proposed and studied [1-5]. Most methods, which can achieve higher compression ratios, feature 
variable­rate output at the encoder and inevitably require variable­velocity scanners for synchronous 
transmission over digital channels. One penaity for those efficient source ccr&#38;mgsis an increased 
sensitivity to errors in the transmission channel: a single received blterrorwill corrupt the remainder 
of the image when resynchronization sequences are not incorporated into the coded data stream. Consequently, 
these compression systems require high quality channels for successful image transmission. Most compression 
schemes also require codebooks to encode and decode data. For some types of channels, noise immunity 
has priority over compression yield. Examples include HF data links, aircraft communication channels 
and low-grade telephone circuits. The compression method presented in this paper yields intelligible 
images under quite noisy transmission conditions. The constant output bit rate provides for a simple 
interface with fixed-rate equipment. The systcm is suitable Permission to copy without fee ail or part

by virtue of ~mg constant­rate, does not require continuous codeword aynchronizatiow a necessity for 
variable-rate systems. In addkion to providing strong immunization from transmission errors, the coding 
method encodes block-pairs of binary image data ova a field of blocks without the need for codebooks. 
INTERLEAVED BLOCK CODING SCHEME In a typical two-tone image, most part of the image is white, the amount 
of black is usually a very amali &#38;action of the totai area of the image. Therefore, it appears that 
rearranging the black clement content to occupy the white spaces reduces the number of bits to be transmitted. 
A schema baaed on this idea is described now. This scheme is similar to the WIIS (white block skipping) 
[6] in some ways. For the WBS, the white space is skipped and oniy the black is rransrnit@ for the IBC 
(Interleaved Block Coding), the black element content is rearrmged to occupy the white spaces. Each scan 
line is divided into pairs of N-bh blocks and for each block-pair a fixed-length codeword is transmitted 
consisting of a three-bit header followed by an N-bit block pattam. An image is restored from a codktg 
field which is comprised of a fixed number of block­pairs. =tion of Bl@-Patr SW Based on the presence 
of the all-whi% ail-black and nonwhite block pattern on the left or right side of a block-pair, each 
block-pair is classified as being M one of nine states (Table I). TABLE 1. DEFiNlllONOF BIXWK-PAIR STATESAND 
HiMDER WORD B1ock-Pair Block-Pairs Heaier Pattern State Wotd white-white Ww 000 black-white BW 101 nonwhite-white 
NW 100 white-black WB 011 whke-nonwhi te WN 010 nonwhite-nonwhite N N 001 nonwhite-black NB 111 black-nonwhite 
110 black-black :: 111 For data-compression, only combinations of three header coding bits identify these 
nine states. Instead of increasing the 37 header wordlength to four bits to identify the ninth state 
(BB), header word 111 is chosen to represent the nonwhite-black (NB) and the black-black (BB) block-pair 
states. The fact is that the combinations of header (111) and adjoined block patterns (all 1s) will never 
occur in the other eight-state amangement. The nine states header codings are shown in Table 1. Pm@&#38;&#38; 
 The coding procedure consists of two stages. (A) Scanning for the block-pairs of the coding field for 
the presence of the N N (nonwhite-nonwhite) block-pairs. The scrm starts from the leftmost proceeding 
to the rightmost block-pair of the field. When an NN block-pair is detected, its right nonwhite block 
pattern is stored into a first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer. (B) Encoding block-pairs. The encoding stage 
commences after the scan stage is completed. From the leftmost block-pair of the field, each block-pair 
is encoded. A three-bit header word is assigned to be the state identification of each block-pair. This 
header is followed by an N-bit block pattern, where N is the number of pixels assumed to be in the block. 
The N-bit block pattern depends upon the state of the block-pair. For the bbck­pair of a NW, WN, NB or 
a BN state, the N-bit block pattern is the nonwhite block of the pair, For the black-black (BB) state, 
the all-black left block pattern is transmitted. If the state of the block-pair is NN, since the right 
nonwhite block is fed into buffer the left nonwhite pattern is the only choice. Finally, if the current 
block-pair exhibits an all-white (W W), black-white (B W ) or white-black (W B ) pattern, the transmitted 
block pattern is taken from the FfFO buffer. If the buffer is empty an all-white pattern is transmitted. 
In this coding method, right nonwhite elements of NN block-pairs in the field are carried out by the 
WW, BW and WB block-pairs. An example is shown in Fig. 1.  ~7Dat ooo-lol~ol Imolmoolmsmt Figure 1. Example 
of IBC Coding Procedure, 4-bit Block At the receiver a reverse two-stege process is implemented. (A) 
Examining the input header words for WW, BW and WB states. At the receiver, when a W W, BW or a W B state 
is examined the adjoined N-bit block pattern is fed into a FIFO buffer. (B) Decoding block-pairs. At 
the end of a scan for a field, the decoding stage starts. Here the block-pair pattern is reconstructed 
according to the hea&#38;r word and its adjoined block pattern. For a WN or an NW block-pair, art all 
white N­bit block is reinserted into left or right block. If a block-pair identifies the BN state, then 
tm all-black N-bit block is inserted into the left block. N B and B B block-pairs have the same header 
(11 1); both states trartsmit dte left block pattern, so the all-black block is reinserted into the right 
block. If the block­pair is the W W state, then two N-bh blocks for all-white are restored. For the BW 
and the W B states, the all-black and the all-white blocks are inserted into suitable positions. For 
an NN block-pair the right nonwhite elements are taken from the FIFO buffer. An example is given in Figure 
2. %+!!T:Ty - o w w R@­ boo~~wal llfio-oo~l ll~loo@oo WlollIll QJJconwvctmt w Bw Wo wm Figure 2. Example 
of IBC Deco&#38;mg Procedure, 4-bit Block  In view of the interleaving nature of the compression technique, 
the method has been designated *Interleaved Block Coding (I BC). Figure 3 contains the block diagram 
for instrumentation of this compression system. In the encoder the auxiliary FIFO buffer store holds 
the right nonwhite elements of all N N block-pairs in the field. The main buffer store irnpkrmmts the 
field delay. At the end of an encoded field the FIFO contents are inserted into the outpu~ via S2, when 
WW, BW and W B patterns are detected. For each block-pair the header and block pattern are adjoined and 
released serially into the transmission channel, At the receiver, the header and block pattern components 
of the codeword are separamd and for W W, BW and WB states the block pattern is fed into the FIFO buffer. 
At the end of a decoded field the contents of the later are reinserted into the NN block-pairs as identified 
by the delayed header words, and the reconstructed block-pair is fed to the recording unit serially. 
One impediment to the use of this algorithm is the occurrence of the totrd number of NN block-pairs is 
over the total number of W W, B W and W B block-pairs, preventing the complete transmission of the contents 
of the FIFO buffer at the end of the field. This is called field overflow ; the simplest strategy is 
not to transmit nonwhite blocks, their original right nonwhite blocks are replaced by the all-white pattern 
at the receiver. This process is termed blanking of excess nonwhite blocks. The resulting distortion 
takes the form of lost black elements. In a later section there are some techrdques to improve this case 
where surplus nonwhite blocks are blanked and encoding distortion consists entirely of lost black elements. 
The basic compression ratio, that can be obtained, with the Interleaved Block Coding method readily is 
seen to be 2?? CR (1) m 2 (2) 1+3/N. Where N is the number of pixels in each block. The bh rate per 
block is defined as the reciprocal of the compreaaion ratio. The result as a function of N is plotted 
in Ftgure 4. The compression ratio tends to two when the block size grows to irtfhity. However, beyond 
a value of N of about 8 pixels the compression ratio increases only gradually for increasing. The compression 
ratio of the IB C is not very high. but in many instances the sacrifice in compression provides for ease 
of implementation decreasing the complexity of the system. In the next swtion a block size of 8 pixels 
is used throughout the simulation. It is a good choice in terms of performance and efficiency of implementation 
allowing use of commercial digital ICS and eight-bit microprocessors. SIMULATION STUDIES This section 
shows the performance of the I B C using simulations with eight test images. The set of test images is 
shown in F@res 5 and 6. The original documents are all 8 1/2 x 11 in size generally carreaponding to 
the set of eight CCITT reference documents. The sampling rate is 150 ppi. For the bkxk size, we choose 
an 8-bit block throughout the simulation therefore the compression ratio is fixed at 1.45, which cmreaptmds 
to a bit rate of 0.69 (defined as the reciprocal of the compression ratio). add rnbtn 98rtd \bok-@r buffer)

Ratio as a Function of Block Size The measured probabilities of the blcck-pair states for the test images 
are shown in Table 2. From Table Z it is clear that overflow-free, or lossless, codiig is obtairtable 
for all the test images when the field size is sufficiently large such as the whole image (15360 block-pairs). 
The size of the whole image as a test fitdd produces the probability P(ww+wB +RW) which is sufficiently 
larger than the probability PNN. In a practical implementation it is deaiiable to keep the field size 
as small as possible. Apart horn increased amount of storage and hardware, an important reason is the 
effect of transmission emors. From the simulation results for Interleaved Block Coding in field size 
F=160 (160 block-pairs), the reconstructed images are good especially when an image contains large whke 
or large black spaces (such as A2, A6 and A8). This is due to the number of W W. B W and W B block-pairs 
in the coding field being enough to transmit the NN block-pairs. The subjective effect of blanking of 
blocks in overflow fields may be examined in Fig. 7 where the image A4, is densely typed in English text. 
Inter-word and inter-letter white spaces of dense text are obviously by themselves unable to furnish 
enough W W, B W and WB @s of blocks to convey the abundant fight blocks of nonwhite-nonwhite block-pairs 
in the field. Howevex, it is evident, that the intelligibility of characters is mainly unaffected by 
this kind of d~tortion. This is due to the fact that in the event of blanking, NN pairs will always have 
only the right block &#38;let@ with the letl block intac~ and for a series of such NN block-pairs in 
au active region, left nonwhite blocks remain which are sufficient to preserve the form and legibility 
of characters if the block size is not very large. Thus, even in the worst situation, when all the NN 
block-pairs in the field have their right blocks deleted, intelligibility largely is preserved due to 
retention of left nonwhhe blocks. Generally, the loss of blocks is quite vtilble even though the percentage 
of such losses over the total numlwr of blocks in the irrtage may be very small. The human eye is quite 
sensitive to loss of black elements in the image. A modlficd IB C technique improves this coding method, 
TABLE 2 STATISTICS OF TEST IMAGE FOR BUICK SIZE 0F8PIXELS In order to reduce the amount of encoding distortion, 
a simple strategy may be adopted. Instead of omitting the last-occurring nonwhite blocks of the field, 
we use the color correlation of pixels in a block-pair source to reccmstntct the imagq i.e. for two side-by-side 
pixels, the latter is always the same color as the former, The procedure is as follows. In the first 
step of the coding procedure, when an NN block-pair is detected, its even numbered pixels (2, 4, 6, 8, 
10, 12, 14, 16 pixels in the simulation) are extracted as an N-bh block pattern and stored into the FIFO 
buffer. For the encoding step for an NN block­pair state, the odd numbered pixels are the only choice 
as a transmitted block pattern since the even numbered pixels have been fed into the buffer. There is 
no change arty other state, either in the coding procedure or in the deading procedure. At the end of 
the decoding step for an N N block-pair, the algorithm restores the odd numbered-pixel block pattern 
which is transmitted by the pair itself, and restores the even numbered­pixel block pattern which is 
taken from the FIFO buffer accordiig to their original odd or even numbers. The procedures of the modified 
IB C described above occur with the non­overflow condition. When the overflow condition happens, the 
even numbered-pixel block patterns in the FIFO buffer are not all transmitted by W W, BW and W B block-pairs, 
thus some NN block-pairs will only have the odd numbered-pixel block pattern left at the end of the decoding 
procedure. Instead of aubstitutirtg by the all-white pattern at the receiver to lose black elements, 
we simply make a copy of the odd mmtbered­pixel block pattern as the even numbered-pixel block pattern, 
then reinsert these two patterns which have odd numbered and even numbered pixels respectively into their 
original positions. Figure 8 shows an example of modified IBC under overflow condition. --­ - - --­ -

.067 .094 .042 .031 .292 Dots lo 011101 The performrmce of the IBC and the modified IBC methods has 
hitherto been described using the assumption of error-free transmission conditions. In the event of transmission 
errors the effect depends on which type of bks have been cormptd lf the bits of the block pattern are 
incorrectly receiv~ then the reconstructed pattern shows the errors on a pixel-by-pixel basis; i.e., 
a single corrupted bit produces a single reconstructed pixel error. The facsimile image cm tolerate a 
substantial number of this type of errors without loss of intelligibfity, especially if they are sufficiently 
isolated from one another. If the bits of the header word are incorrectly received, the corrupmess of 
the rcconstxucted image is more serious. A false report on the status of the current block-pair ie the 
direct result. The most serious effect occurs when an NN, WW, BW or a WB state header word is corrupted 
or generated. Then an incorrect block will be placed in the FIFO buffer, or a valid block maybe omitted. 
Because the reinstatement of the FIFO buffer cx.mtents works on a sequential basis, the result can be 
the incorrect placement of all the blocks in the buffer. However, there is no total failure of the decoding 
process. WW, BW, NW, WB, W N, N B, BN end B B block-pairs may still be correctly reinserted. The left 
halves of nonwhite-nonwhhe (NN ) block­pairs will also be recovered without error for uncorrupted NN 
header states in the field. This aspect is of importance es it ensures that a large proportion of the 
image material is successfully reconstructed even if the squential reinstatement of right blocks of nonwhite-nonwhtte 
pairs has been affected adversely. Furthermore, since the proportion of header bits in the coded bit 
stream is smal~ consequently the IBC system is able to withstand relatively large levels of transmission 
errors. The effects of transmission errors were investigated via simulation by subjecting the coded output 
of the image Al to controlled amounts of computer-generated random errore. Figure 10 show the reconstructed 
images for average error rates of 1 in 1000, 1 in 100 and 1 in 32, by ttsing the modified IBC respectively. 
From experimental results, art excellent level of intelligibility is preserved at the rate of 1 in 1000. 
At the rate of 1 in 100 the text is readable completely and its intelligibility is largely unimpaired. 
When the average error rate is increased to 1 in 32 the qurdity is degraded to some extent, but it is 
still possible to read and understand the text. Certain individual characters are unrecognizable but 
words and sentences can be deciphered from context. .. OIO 1 FIFOBuffer son with White ~ As mentioned 
in an earlier sectiom the compression ratio of the IBC is low. Table 3 shows a comparison of the compression

(WBS) technique. In structured images such as Figure 8. Exsmple of Modified IBC, 4-bit Block, Overflow 
vertical densely-typed tex~ e.g., Chinese and Japanese and largely-black documents, both methods achieve 
nearly ideal The simulation results of the modified IB C with a field size, F=64 ,are represented in 
Figure 9. Comparing these with the results for the IB C, the improvement in the distortionless transmission 
is signflcant. This is expected because instead of blanking the blocks, we take advantage of color correlation 
between two connected pixels within a document by duplicating the pixels, The modified I B C scheme exhibits 
a large improvement in distortiordess transmission, and it is still a simple, efficient coding method. 
EFFECTS OF TRANSMISSION ERRORS compression ratios. When a document contains large black portions such 
as A8, the IB C even has a slightly higher compression ratio than the W BS. However, it appears that 
for typical documents, the W B S is superior to the IB C in data compression. One penalty for efficient 
coding is an increased sensitivity to channel errors. Figure 11 gives clear results of the effects of 
transmission errors for bigher compression ratio techniques at a vtwiable-rate output. For the WBS method, 
at the error rate of 1 in 1000, some words are recognizable, but sentences and context obviously cannot 
be read from those words. At the rates of 1 in 100 and 1 in 32, the entire image is corrupt and the 
40 text totally is unreadable. When transmission errors occur, a higher compression ratio makes the reconstructed 
image worse. The WBS works especially well in data compression for largely-white images such as A2 and 
A3. A bit for all white block changing from O to 1 can cause loss of synchronization. Such an error causes 
the receiver to expect the wrong block pattern for the following block. Aa a resul~ the block pattern 
is reconstructed and located incorrectly; the error propagates to the subsequent bbcks. Compared to the 
WBS, the IBC has a lower compression ratio, but a higher image quality when channel noise occurs. The 
fixed-rate output codiig technique proves to have strong immunity to transmission errors at least for 
single bk flips. TABLE 3. COMPRESSION RATIOS OF IBC AND WBS lQR 8-BIT BLOCK S3ZE ~,~--~ A4 A5 A6 A7 -

1.45 CONCLUSIONS A fixed-rate one-dimensionaf compression method in which the input image data is delayed 
and pairs of blocks are encoded in accordance with their white states has been presented. The constant-rate 
output provides a strong immunity to transmission errors and without requiring continuous codeword synchronization 
as is necessary in variable-rate systems. Also the method encodes block-pairs of two-tone image data 
without the need for codebooks. In the case where distortion is due entirely to the blartking of blocks, 
a copy procedure based on the color correlation between two connected pixels has been found to be an 
effective method for reducing the level of black element loss. The results of simulation by using 8-pixel 
blocks have shown images with a high intelligibility. In the presence of a transmission error rate of 
1 in 100 bits, the reconstructed image maintains a good intelligibility; at a rate as high as 1 in 32 
bits the recovered image largely is readable. REFERENCES <RefA>[1] T. S. Hutmg, Codiig of Two-Tone Images,
