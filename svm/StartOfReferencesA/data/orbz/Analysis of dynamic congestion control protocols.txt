Department of Computer Scienceg University of Wisconsin -Madison Madison, WI 53 706 Abstract We present 
an approximate analysis of a queue with dy­namically changing input rates that are based on implicit 
or explicit feedback information. This is motivated by propos­als for adaptive congestion control algorithms 
[RaJa 88, Jac 88], where the sender s window size at the transport level is adjusted based on perceived 
congestion level of a bottleneck node. We develop an analysis methodology for a simplified system; however, 
it is powerful enough to answer the im­portant questions regarding stability, convergence (or oscil­lations), 
fairness and the significant effect that delayed feed­back plays on performance. SpecificsJly, we find 
that, in the absence of feedback delay, the linear increase/exponential decrease algorithm of Jacobson 
and Ramakrishnan-Jain [Jac 88, RaJa 88] is provably stable and fair. Delayed feedback, on the other hand, 
introduces oscillations for every individ­ual user as well as unfairness across those competing for the 
same resource. While the simulation study of Zhang [Zha 89] and the fluid-approximation study of Bolot 
and Shankar [BoSh 90] have observed the oscillations in cumulative queue length and measurements by Jacobson 
[Jac 88] have revealed some of the unfairness properties, the reasons for these have not been identified. 
This study quantitatively identifies the cause of the these effects, vis-a-vis the system parameters 
and properties of the algorithm used. The model presented here is fairly general and can be applied to 
evaluate the performance of a wide range of feed­back control schemes. It is an extension of the classical 
Fokker-Planck equation. Because the Fokker-Planck equa­tion models diffusion, it addresses traflic variability 
that fluid approximation techniques do not. Permission to copy without fee ell or part of this material

the performance of congestion control protocols that dynamically change input rates based on feed­ back 
information received from the network. This is mo­ tivated by proposals for adaptive congestion control 
algo­ rithms [Jac 88, RaJa 88,90], where the sender s window size at the transport layer is adjusted 
based on perceived con­ gestion level of a bottleneck node. Demers et. al. [DeKeSh 89] report a simulation 
study that compares the Jacobson and Ramakrishnan-Jtin algo­ rithms [Jac 88, RaJa 88,90] vis-a-vis scheduling 
disciplines used in intermediate gateways. Zhang [Zh ang 89] compares the TCP protocol, which incorporates 
the Jacobson algo­ rithm, to her Virtual Clock Protocol. In there, she reports some oscillatory properties 
of the Jacobson algorithm. She also observes that connections with larger number of hops receive a poorer 
share of an intermediate resource than those with a smaller number of hops. Jacobson had also reported 
this in his measurements [Jac 88]. Bolot and Shankar [BoSh 90] studied the behavior of the Ramakrishnan-Jtin 
algo­ rithm using a fluid approximation model and they too ob­ served the oscillatory characteristics. 
Recently, some inter­ esting studies have been reported by Mitra and Seery [MiSe 90, Mit 90] and Shenker 
[She 90]. Mitra and Seery have developed a new feedback based dynamic window adjust­ ment algorithm based 
on asymptotic analysis of queueing net works, while Shenker has studied some intrinsic proper­ ties of 
feedback based flow control. In this study, we develop, from first principles, a Fokker- Planck equation 
for the evolution of the joint probability density function of queue length and arrival rate at the bot­ 
tleneck node. This approximates the transient behavior of a queue subjected to adaptive rate-control. 
We then seek answers to questions regarding stability (or oscillations) and fairness of a particular 
adaptive algorithm. We also investi­ gate the effect of delayed feedback on performance. We find that, 
in the absence of feedback delay, senders using the Jacobson-Ramakrishnan-Jtin (or JRJ) Algorithm [Jac 
88, RaJa 88,90] (or rather, an equivalent rate-based algorithm) converge to an equilibrium. Further, 
this algorithm is fair in that all sources sharing a resource get an equrd share of the resource if they 
use the same pa­rameters for adjusting their rates. The exact share of the resource that different sources 
get when they use different parameters is also determined. A delay in the feedback information introduces 
cyclic behavior. If different sources get the feedback information after different amounts of delay, 
then the algorithm may also be unfair, i.e., the sources may get unequal throughput. These results strengthen 
the observations in previous studies and also identify the underlying reasons. For instance, if the adaptive 
algorithm is linear-increase/exponential-decre=e, then the oscillations are due to delayed feedback. 
However, if the adaptive algorithm is linear-increase/linear-decrease, then the oscillations could be 
due to both the algorithm itself and the delay in the feedback path. Also unfairness is partly due to 
the larger (feedback) delay suffered by the longer connections ascompared tothe shorter ones. The rest 
of the paper is organized as follows. Sec­tion 2 presents the model. Section 3 motivates the analysis 
methodology. In Section 4, a Fokker-Planck approximation for the time dependent queue behavior is derived. 
Section 5 discusses the properties of the JRJ-algorithm when only one source is using the resource. Section 
6 investigates the properties of the system with multiple sources. Section 7 re-investigates these properties 
in the presence of delayed feedback. Section 8 presents our conclusions. 2. Model The model we have chosen 
is motivated by the Jacobson-Ramakrishn an-Jain Algorithm for window adjust­ment. In the JRJ algorithm, 
when congestion is detected (by implicit or explicit feedback), the window size is decreased rntdtipkntiuely. 
However, when there is no congestion, it is increased linearly to probe for more bandwidth, i.e., w/d; 
if congested; w+ (1) w + a; if not congested. { While this makes good intuitive sense, it is far from 
clear as to what values the parameters a and d should take. Further, it is not provably clear if the 
algorithm is fair or stable~ and if so, under what circumstances. To understand the behavior of dynamic 
congestion con­ trol algorithms, we study a queueing system with a time varying input rate. The latter 
is adjusted periodically based on some feedback that the end-point receives about the state of the queue. 
We are interested in the time evolution of the queue length density function. Let us assume that we are 
changing the arrival rate, ~(t), based on the current queue length, Q(t), at some bot­ tleneck node. 
An example adaptive control algorithm could be d~ +Co, if Q(t) < ~, (2) %= CIA, if Q(t) > ~ { where ~ 
is some target queue length. Co and Cl are positive constants. 1 An algorithm is fair if everybody gets 
a fair share of the resource (Fair share and equal share are synonymous if all the demands are equal). 
Stability, on the other hand, implies that the algorithm converges to a particular value. Equation 2 
models a linear increase in ~ for Q(t) < ~ and an exponential decrease in it for Q(t) > ~. It is there­fore 
the rate-analogue of the dynamic window adjustment algorithm given by Equation 1. For purposes of generality 
however, we shall denote d~(.) = g(.) (3)dt g( ) can be viewed ss a generic rate-control algorithm. In 
the following section, we motivate the methodology chosen. The method adopted can not only lead to a 
better theoretical understanding of a key problem but also be useful in solving other problems that might 
involve some form of feedback. 3. Methodology To analyze the effect of Equation (2), Bolot and Shankar 
[BoSh 90] have used two separate differential equa­tions, one for the queue length, Q(t), and another 
for the arrival rate A(t). Q(t) depends on A(t) as follows: dQ(t) = A(t d) p dt where p is the mean service 
rate. dA(t)/dt is given by Equa­tion 2. These are then coupled together, i.e., A(t)drives the differential 
equation for Q(t) and vice-versa. Their model assumes that Q(t) and J(t) are both deterministic, Suppose, 
however that Q(t) were a random variable and one attempts to characterize the time evolution of this 
process. Consider the classical Fokker-Planck, or diffusion, equation in one-dimension: where f(t, q) 
is the probability density function of the queue length at time t, (A(t,q) p) and u (t,q)are the instanta­neous 
mean and variance of the queue growth rate given the queue length is g. Now, if this equation is to be 
extended for the congestion-control problem at hand, how should the equation for J be expressed so that 
the control part is prop­erly reflected? It turns out that one cannot use a coupled set of equations 
(one for the density and one for the control) at all. To see this, suppose that Q(t) were a random variable 
and say, we were observing the process {(Q(t), A(t))} as time progressed (see Figure 1). Given some initial 
values (Q(O), J(O)), k+ the queue length at time tbeQ(t) = q, for some q. At this point, the value of 
A(t)is dependent on not just the current value of g, but also on the sample path of Q(s), O < s ~ t. 
Intermediate values of the queue length affects A because of Equation 2 and since the sample path Q : 
: 1 I I : q 1 I time t Figure 1: Queue length trajectory aa a function of time. of Q is random, A(t) 
itself is a random variable. Therefore ~(t) and Q(t) are both independent variables describing the system. 
Hence, we consider a model with two independent vari­ables. Let p be the average service rate of the 
queue and let v(t) = (A(t) ~) be the instantaneous queue growth rate (with the convention that v(t) 
= O if Q(t) = O and A(t) < p). We define ~(t, g, v) to be the joint probability density function of (Q(t), 
v(t)). Our goal is to understand the time dependent behavior of ~(.) based on g(.) and the variabilities 
of Q(t) and v(t). We address this in the next section. 4. Fokker-Planck approximation for queue with 
feedback control Suppose that at time t,the queue length and queue growth rate are given by Q(t) = j 
and v(t) = fi. We want to express the density function j(t + r, q, v) in terms of f(t,~,;).We assume 
that variability in v is caused only by the random sample path of Q and there is no intrinsic variability 
y in v. Then, given Q(t + r) = g, and some small l-, V(t+r)=;+g(.)r. (4) Let h(t + r, q, v [t, ~,;) be 
the conditional probability of the transition between (~, ;) and (q, v) in time time (t,t+~). Then by 
the law of total probability, f(t+ r,q,v) = f(t, ~,;) h(t +T, q,Vlt, ~,;) d~d; (5) // The integral over 
~ in Equation 5 is essentially a delta func­tion which is zero for all values of ~ except that satisfying 
Equation 4. We then have f(t + 7-,g, v) = f(t, fj,;) h(t + 7,q, Vlt,i,0): d~ (6) J with the understanding 
that O and v are related by Equation 4. Now, let us further assume that the central limit theo­rem (approximately) 
holds for the conditional density func­tion h(.), i.e., where U2 is the variance of Q. Validity of this 
assumption is key to the Fokker-Planck approximation that follows.2 Combining Equations 6 and 7 gives 
 To derive the differential equation of j(.) with respect to time, we subtract f(t, g, v) from both sides, 
divide by r and let ~ -+ O. Using d;/dv = 1 gv T from Equation 4, we then get3 9v( )f(t , v) + o(r) 
(9) where o(~) comes from expanding f(t,~,;)in the second in­tegral about (t, q, v). To consider the 
first integral in Equa­tion 9, let 1= lim: (lo) J{f(ti!~)~)} ,+OT-f(t >v( )~i Adding (and subtracting) 
f(t,q,;) to (and from) the right hand side of this equation, we get +: J{f(t) >-f(%q,v)}(11)~)v(.)di 
 The first integral in Equation 11 is similar to expressions arising in the derivation of the standard 
Fokker-Planck equa­tion [New 68, New 71, Kle 76]: 1 ~fg(t, , ~) + ~u2f99(t > ~) As r -0, fi ~ v, (see

described by considering each quadrant separately. Jyo; {f(~, 9, ~ 9( )r) f(t, q, v)} First consider 
Quadrant I in Figure 2. This corresponds tov>O(i.e., A>p)and Q< ~. Since A>p, the = ~i+mo~ {[~(t~ q!

The instantaneous v is also increasing because = 9( )fv(t q, v) (13) dA/dt = Co > 0. The resultant direction 
of instantaneous Combining Equations 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, and noting that motion (i.e., the characteristic) 
is increasing in both Q and g~f + gfv = (gf)., we have v as shown in the figure. Notice that Equation 
14 confirms this intuition: the coefficient of jg which represents the Q­ (14) drift is v and this is 
positive in Quadrant I; the coefficient Equation 14 describes the basic equation of motion for the of 
$V which represents the v-drift is g(.) = +Co which is density function j(.). positive as well. The characteristic 
is the resultant of these two drifts. 5. Properties of Algorithm 2 Next, consider Quadrant II. Here Q 
> ~ and v >0 (i.e., A > p). From Equation 14, the Q-drift is again positive since v >0. However, the 
v-drift is now negative because dA/dt is CIA for Q > ~. The characteristic, which is the resultant of 
these two drifts, is increasing in Q but decreasing in v as shown in Figure 2. We can similarly check 
that in Quadrant III, both the v o Q-drift and the v-drift are negative while in Quadrant IV, I the Q-drift 
is negative but the v-drift is positive. The direc- IY IV III ~ tions of individual drifts and the characteristics 
are shown in the figure. Now, suppose we were to trace the path of a particle that obeys both Equation 
14 and Equation 2. This path will follow the characteristic. Therefore, from the above ar­gument, it 
is clear that the trajectory would either be a cycle or a spiral; the latter could be one that converges 
inwards or diverges outward. Further, a convergent spiral could home in to either a limit point or a 
limit c~cie. Theorem 1 be- Figure 2: Characteristics and their directions, low says that the path of

&#38; 00 ~ Q Figure 3: Converging spiral. Now, suppose that at time t = O, A is some value An which 
is less than p and q is ~ (see Figure 3). From Equation 17, we have dzq = 6 0. &#38;2 Its solution is 
q = :Cotz + (Ao fl)t+ i (18) After a certain time, say tl, the characteristic hits q = ~ line again. 
Let A be Al now. For the moment, let us assume that the characteristic did not hit the q = O boundary, 
so that Equation 18 is valid all the way up to t = tl. The two roots of Equation 18 with q = ~ are t 
= O and t = 2(,u ~o)/Co. The first one corresponds to the initial point. Therefore. (19) Also, since 
A = p + dq/dt, we have, from Equation 18 and 19, Al= P+cotl+(Ao P) =2 fL-AIJ (20) Notice that Al p 
is equal to P A. which says that the overshoot above p is exactly equal to p Ao, irrespective of the 
value of Co. This is therefore an inherent property of the linear increase component of Algorithm 2. 
Let us next evaluate the characteristic when q is greater than ~. We have dq =A p (21)dt dzq ~ = g(~, 
p) = -Cl(p + dq/dt) d2q + C1$+CIP=O (22) d dt2 Since at t= tl,q = ~ and dq/dt = Al p, its solution 
is q = p(t tl)+ ~ (1 e-elf:-i )) + ~ (23) Let the characteristic again hlt the q = ~ line at some 
later time t2and let A now be A2. Then from Equation 23, we have at time t2, p(tz tl)+ ~ 1 e-cl(t -t 
) = O ()  Putting a = Cl(tz tl), we get pa = Al(l e-o). (24) Since dq/dt is eqmd to A p, A2 can 
be obtained by differ­entiating Equation 23. We get AZ = A~e-C1(t2-tl) = Ale-a (25) Substituting the 
value of Al from Equation 20, we have AZ= (2P -Ao)e-&#38; (26) Therefore * = (2; -l)e- (27) The question 
then is whether ~2/Ao is greater than 1, less than 1 or equal to 1. From Figure 3, we see that i-f A2/Ao 
were greater than 1, we would have a converging spiral. We verify next that this is indeed the case. 
Let ~ = p/~l in Equation 24. Then, using Equation 20, we have Substituting into Equation 27, we get 
 5=[+11e- =[+11 - [1 1 -a (29) = 27 1 e From Equation 24, y is given by 1 e-a r = (Y Therefore, _1=2 
cr-2e-a~~_ ~_ 2(1 e-a) (30)CY a and from 29 and 30, (31) Let us next define a function, h(a), such 
that h(a) = (2 a 2e-a) cre-a (32) If h(a) is less than O, then from Equation 31, A2/Ao is greater 
than 1. Notice that h(0) is O and h (a) = 1 + e-a + se-a. so, h (o) = o. Differentiating once again, 
h (cr) = se-a <0 for Cr>o Therefore, c1 h (a) = h (a) <0 J 0 Similarly, a h(cr) = h (cr) <0 (33) I0 
 From Equations 31, 32 and 33, we have ~>1 (34) Jo which implies that the spiral is convergent. So far, 
we have assumed that the characteristic starting at (~, Ao) never hits the q = O boundary. In this case, 
we have established that we have a convergent spiral. To complete the proof, let us next consider the 
case when a characteristic hits the left boundary, q = O. Notice that this characteristic cannot hit 
the boundary for A > ~, because the q-drift which is positive for A > jL, will pull it to the right. 
Therefore, if it hits the q = O boundary then A ~ p. Suppose that for some initial (~, ~o), the characteristic 
barely touches the boundary. This point is (q = O, A = p), as shown by arc a in Figure 4. Since Equations 
18, 19 and 20 hold for this characteristic, it will converge by the earlier argument. Any point corresponding 
to ~o < A o first hits the q = 0 boundary (as shown by arc e), then goes vertically up until J = p, (arc 
~), and then follows the characteristic corresponding to ~o, (arcs b, c, d). This too, therefore, converges. 
The partial differential equation 14 is however, not quite valid in this range. This completes the proof 
of Theorem 1. 1 I 1 Q Figure 4: Converging spiral when characteristics touch the q = O boundary. corollary 
1: If both the increase and the decrease com­ . ponents are linear, then the system will never converge. 
Proof: We saw from Equation 20 that the amount of overshoot exactly equals the amount of undershoot during 
the linear increase phase irrespective of the value of Co. The same is true in the reverse direction 
for a linear decrease algorithm. Hence, the system moves in a non-convergent cycle. 1 We now address 
the changes that occur due to u being nonzero and small. To do this, consider an initial state that is 
zero except for a small rectangle in which the function f is constant. Assume that this rectangle is 
to the left of the line g = ~. Let the rectangle be given by ql < q < gz < ~ and VI < v < V2. The main 
mass of the solution will proceed zs it would under the influence of the characteristics, but with the 
additional change due to diffusion in the g direction. According to our analysis there is no diffusion 
in the v direction. Thus the solution to the left of q = ij will be sharply limited between the two lines 
VI + Cotand V2 -1-cot. AS the solution encounters the line g = ~, it will change the direction of motion, 
and there will be a spreading of the solution in the v direction because of the different times that 
the different parts encounter the line q = ~. The main mass of the solution will follow the path given 
by the characteristics for small times. For longer times, the convergence of the characteristics to the 
limit point, suggests that the probability distribution will converge to a limiting distribution. Most 
likely the lim­iting solution will be independent of the initial conditions. More study is required to 
resolve this speculation. This lim­iting distribution will be a smooth function, except perhaps at the 
line q = Z where g changes sign, due to the diffu­ sion in q and the spreading in v. Note that the steady-state 
equation r is locally of parabolic type (with v being the time-like vari­able and q being the space-like 
variable) and thus haa in­finitely differentiable solutions. The analysis of thk equation is nontrivial 
since the coefficient of the time-like direction changes sign with q. A numerical simulation of the pde 
illustrates its time­dependent behavior, see Figures 5-7. (A detailed study along with the finite difference 
scheme used for this solution will be described elsewhere.) Figure 5 shows the contour plot of an arbitrary 
probability density function (pdf ) f(.) at t equals O and at a slightly later time. In this experiment, 
~ was set to 4.5, Co was 0.5 and Cl was 0.$. The pdf contours turn around the quadrants as expected, 
but also spread out because of the diffusion term. For longer times, the main mass of the density function 
spiraIs around as seen in Figures 6 and 7 The maximal point of the pdf seems to settle in the quadrant 
where q > ~ and A < p. ~ 30 4.0 5.0 G.o 7.0 Figure 5: Contour diagram of a probabUity density function

Assuming that there exists an equilibrium distribution, ft ~ O. Further, at points of max­ima, fg = fV 
= O and ~qq <0. Therefore from Equation 14, we have g f = ;Usfqq <0 and since f ~ O everywhere, g <o

= I. Figure 7: The pdf after some more time. Now, for stable queueing systems, the mean arrival rate 
is less than p. (Unless all service times and inter-arrival times are deterministic, when the two could 
be equal. ) If this holds for the feedback queue as well, then ~= ~ f(% ~) @~~ <0 II Denoting v = v+

that the maximal points in ~() are to the right of g = ~, one may expect v to be less than zero at these 
points. This is not a proof but only an intuitive explanation as to why the peak is seen to settle at 
a point at which A < p. 6. Multiple Sources w o Figure 8: Meaning of Atl, At2 and At3. We have assumed 
so far that there is only a single source transmitting through a particular node. We next investigate 
the properties of the system with multiple sources. Specifi­cally, we are interested in the convergence 
and fairness prop­erties when multiple sources compete for a resource. There are two feedback schemes 
that we consider; one where all the sources receive the (same) cumulative queue length in­formation [RaJa 
88, Jac 88] and another, where each source receives its own queue length information only.4 In the lat­ter 
case, fairness is guaranteed by the scheduler; the analysis of the previous sections then apply directly 
to each source; if there are n sources, we change v to ,u/n and apply Equa­tions 2 and 12. The conclusion 
is that the system is both convergent and fair. Next, let us consider the case when all sources receive 
the common queue length information. All of them adjust their rates according to Algorithm 2. If there 
are n sources, let (Al(t),...,&#38;(t)) denote transmission rates A~(t),their at time t. Let ~(t) = ~~=1 
Ai(t)be the cumulative trans­mission rate and let Q(t) be the cumulative queue length at time t.Then

Ai(t) = CIA(t), if Q(t) > g. { This is the equivalent version of Equation 2 for multiple sources. Equations 
12 and 35 completely specify the behav­ ior of the system. From Theorem 1, this system of multiple sources 
converges. Notice that the increase rate is propor­tional to n, but the decrease rate is unchanged. Therefore, 
the length of the spiral trajectory (the path to convergence) is the same, but the time to traverse it 
is shortened (see Equations 18 and 19). We next investigate if Algorithm 35 is ~air. If it is, then the 
~~s must be equal to each other in the limit. Theorem 2: Algorithm 3.5 is fair. Proof: For the purposes 
of this proof, let us assume that the different sources use different increase and decrease param­eters. 
5 Suppose there are n sources and let source i use an increase parameter C o,i and a decrease parameter 
Cl,i. Let A1, A2, ..., An denote their respective transmission rates in the limit (notice that convergence 
is guaranteed by Theorem 1). Then A= Al+ A2+.. .+ An=p (36) Suppose ~~, A;, . . . . A: are the transmission

fairness. I In real systems, this may be violated because the sources get the feedback information after 
different amounts of delay and due to finite queue capacity. ~ 4 +7+ _T _T ~ Figure 9: Delayed feedback,

is changed. Let us, for the moment, assume that d is O. The control algorithm can now be precisely stated 
as: ifQ(t r)~g, -&#38;) = co (42) CIA(t), if Q(t r) > ~ { The queueing system with delay in the feedback 
path is harder to analyze. If we ignore the u2-component, the re­sulting reduced system is readily tractable. 
The study of the Fokker-Planck equation with delay is the subject of on-going investigation; we shall 
address the issues involved at the end of this sub-section. With the a2-component deleted, the model 
is similar to the Bolot and Shankar model [BoSh 90]. It is encouraging that the results obtained are 
similar. The main difference is that their model assumes ~ = O. If j is greater than O, some int cresting 
properties of g(.) are revealed, regarding convergence and fairness. With feedback delay, Algorithm 42 
does not converge to a point. To see this, suppose that at time to, the process is at the target equilibrium 
point Q(to) = ~ and A(to)= p. We shall show that it cannot remain here for any significant amount of 
time. We need to consider two cases. First, let us say that the process arrived at this point from the 
left, i.e., Q(to r) < ~. Then dA(t)/dt = 6 0, t E (i!o, to + r) (43) Therefore A(to+ T) = A(to)+ Tell 
= /.4 + ?-co > p (44) and (45) Q(~o+~)=i+ ;co~2 >i Figure 10 shows this pictorially (see Quadrant II). 
The pro­cess overshoots the equilibrium point because r >0. Next, let us consider the case when the process 
arrives at (~, p) from the right, i.e., Q(to r) > ij. Then dA(t)/dt = CIA(t), t G (to, to + r) (46) 
Therefore A(tcI + r) = A(to)e-c r = pe-C r < p (47) and Q(to+r)=~ $ (TC1 -1 +e-C r) < ~ (48) Figure 
10 shows this case too (Quadrant IV). The process, here, undershoots the equilibrium. Notice that the 
overshoot and the undershoot are going to be larger than what is shown above because when Q(to) = ~, 
the value of A will either be greater than p or less than p (depending on whether the process came from 
left or right respectively). Clearly the system cannot stabilize at (~, p). Further, at any other point 
in the g A space, the process is forced to be in motion. Therefore the system oscillates. These oscillations 
cannot however, become unbounded. To see this, suppose the process is currently at (Ao, ~) and A. is 
large. go is Co. r time units later the control algorithm switches to the exponential decay phase. After 
some time, say Atl, the process hits the q = ~ line again. Another r time units later it switches to 
the linear increase phase. Let this point be (Al, ql ). Then Al = (Ao + Cor)e-cl(At + ) ~ O During the 
linear increase phase, the process once again hits q = ~ line (say, after time At2). Let the value of 
A now be }2. Then AZ= Al + CoAtz Notice that At2 is bounded because Al > 0 and 91 a O. Hence, ~2 is 
bounded from above. This means that if AO is large, the diameter of the oscillation has to shrink in 
the next cycle. This, t oget her with the fact that there can be no stable point, proves the following 
theorem. Theorem 3: Feedback delay, as expressed by Equation 42, intro­duces oscillations. These oscillations 
converge to a limit cy­cle. ~ While we believe that this limit cycle is unique, we do not have a proof 
for it. The diameter of the oscillatory cycle increases with the delay, r. If different sources experience 
different delays, they have different oscillatory cycles. This could lead to unfair­ness in resource 
usage. Equations 44, 45, 47 and 48 point to an important diffi­culty with choosing parameters Co and 
Cl. The oscillations are larger with higher values of of these parameters. Thus, while larger values 
of CO and Cl help to converge faster in the absence of delay (see Equation 18 for example), they cause 
larger oscillations in the presence of delay. Next, let us consider the effect of the inertia d. We still 
have ifQ(t r)~q,$.I(t) = ::\(t), (49) if Q(t r)>~{ However, d2Q/dt 2 is now given by $Q(t) = -&#38; 
d) = +C(J, if Q(t r d)~~, (50) CIA(t), if Q(t r d) > ~ { i.e., the queue length now lags r + d time 
units whHe ~ still lags r time units. The oscillatory effect is now more severe, but qualitatively similar 
to the previous case, i.e., larger values of Co and Cl cause larger oscillations. The Fokker-Planck equation 
on delayed feedback looks like: The difference is in the appearance of the term E[g(Q(t ~) lg, v)] instead 
of g(g, v). The former is the expected value of go at time t r given that Q(t) = q and v(t)= v, while 
the latter is the value of go at the current time itself. Computing the value of E[g( .)] turns out to 
be non-trivial and is the subject of ongoing investigation. One goal is to find a way to do so. A second 
goal is to find ways to ensure that E[g( .)] maintains desirable properties of convergence. For example, 
if one were in Quadrant II in Figure 2, (i.e., Q(t) > ~ and A(t) > p), a desirable property of E[g(.)] 
would be for it to be negative and proportional to A p. While this may in fact turn out to be a formidable 
problem, it is interesting to see that if the system were deterministic, it can easily be ensured. In 
the presence of delayed feedback, one may separate random fluctuations into two categories those that 
are short term and those that are medium term. By short­term fluctuations, we mean those which have a 
time con­stant smaller than the roundtrip delay (or as it turns out two round-trip delays); the feedback 
mechanism is not use­ful for tracking this phenomenon. Feedback may however be used to track medium term 
fluctuations those that have a larger time constant. To filter out short-term fluctuations, Ramakrishnan-Jain 
have used averaging of the feedback in­formation over a period of time. Exponential averaging is another 
method that is often employed. 8. Summary and conclusions We presented an approximate analysis of a queue 
with dynamically changing input rates baaed on implicit or ex­ plicit feedback. This was motivated by 
recent proposals for adaptive congestion control algorithms [RaJa 88, 90, Jac 88], where the sender s 
window size at the transport level was adjusted based on perceived congestion level of a bottleneck node. 
We developed an analysis methodology for a simplified system; yet it was powerful enough to answer the 
important questions regarding stability, convergence (or oscillations), fairness and the significant 
effect that delayed feedback plays on performance. Specifically, we found t hat, in t he absence of feedback 
delay, the linear increase/exponential decrease algorithm of Jacobson and Ramakrishnan-Jtin [Jac 88, 
RaJa 88] was provably stable and fair. Delayed feedback, on the other hand, int reduced oscillations 
for every individual user as well as unfairness across those competing for the same re­source. These 
oscillations set tle down to a limit cycle, i.e., a cyclic pattern that was constant in the limit. This 
cyclic pat­tern is in agreement with simulation results of Zhang [Zha 89] and the fluid analysis of Bolot 
and Shankar [BoSh 90]. The proof of the existence of a limit cycle, we believe, is a stronger result. 
The diameter of the limit cycle (or equiv­alently the magnitude of the oscillations) was seen to be sensitive 
to the parameters Co, Cl and the feedback delay. For instance, for a fixed Co and feedback delay, a larger 
Cl increased this diameter. So, while in the absence of feedback delay, a larger Cl boosted the speed 
of convergence, in the presence of delay, it caused wilder oscillations. The size of the oscillations 
also increased with C . and feedback delay. The model is fairly general and is applicable to evaluate 
the performance of a wide range of feedback control schemes. Acknowledgements We wish to thank Prof.
