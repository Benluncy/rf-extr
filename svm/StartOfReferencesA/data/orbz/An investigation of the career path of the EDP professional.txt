 An Investigation of the Career Path of the EDP Professional Mohan R. Tanniru Syracuse University Introduction 
 Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in the number of persons employed in data processing (DP) 
positions. One researcher has estimated that the field grew by 234% from 1965 to 1975 as more and more 
individuals entered DP positions (Sullivan and Cornfield, 1979). This growth is not surprising given 
the rapid expansion of computer utilization in private commercial organizations, i.e., from one company 
in 1954 to approximately 100,000 today" (Loeske and Sonquist, 1979). Furthurmore, with rapid technological 
changes continuing to take place and a growing demand from the public for computer services in general, 
a high level of growth in DP positions is expected for the future. U.S. government statistics predict 
that a 55% increase in personnel will occur across three professional categories in this field (i.e., 
programmer, pro- grammer analyst, and other specialists) from 1974-1985 (Mooney and Tschetta, 1976). 
 Despite optimistic predictions for future growth, organizations hiring DP personnel have been experiencing 
high turnover rates in these positions which have made staffing even current jobs a difficult task. A 
recent national survey of 245 diverse organ- izations carried out by the A.S. Hansen Consulting firm 
reported a mean annual separ- ation (turnover) rate of 25.1% (Green, 1980). Other surveys have reported 
similar higher percentages, such as 28% (McLaughlin, 1979). In general, most of the turnover may be termed 
voluntary, i.e., due to the empolyees' rather than the organizations' volition. While there are a significant 
number of studies (1,3,4,5,6) that focus on the turnover behavior of data processing professionals, not 
much work has been done in understanding the career profiles of these individuals. Some studies (10,13) 
identify a carefully planned career path as one of the variables that can attract and retain data processing 
professionals, along with other variables such as salary, job identity and sophisticated computer equipment. 
Cougar (7) alludes to the fact that the data processing profes- sionals of the 80's have to be brought 
into the mainstream of business if they are to feel committed to organizational goals rather than their 
own. While this can be done through job assignments that have organizational~identity, it is also possible 
to encourage committment through interesting and challenging career plans for individuals that are congruent 
with the organizational goals. Many organizations fail to treat the long-term career pathing of a new 
employee as a top-priority. Instead, the emphasis often is placed on the immediate job challenge and 
the modern equipment used in the organization. This will have the effect of attracting individuals who 
want to gain short-term experience rather than those with long-term committment. This may be attributed 
partly to the pressure put on the organizations to fill the voids quickly so that systems projects may 
not be delayed Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that

constitutes a DP career. This is in complete contrast to other management professions such as accounting, 
marketing, and finance where the career paths are laid out to enable one to reach positions such as partners 
(in accounting firms), comptrollers, product managers, and vice-presidents of finance. Albrecht (2) 
discusses an elaborate procedure for constructing career paths. This procedure maps various position 
categories to different tasks in application develop- ment and maintenance. Given the nature of the tasks 
an individual has to perform for each position in the career ladder, one can define the knowledge and 
skills that are necessary to become successful in that position. Such a procedure can motivate an individual 
to expand his/her skills to meet the challenges of an individual's chosen career path. Even though this 
does not include all segments of the MIS operations, it does address the career pathing issue with care. 
 The objective of this paper is not to propose a new model for constructing career paths, but to observe 
the career paths taken by a group of DP professionals over a span of 10 to 20 years. This should result 
in drawing some conclusions about the frequencies with which certain paths are taken and their characteristics. 
This could provide some guidelines to organizations that may wish to construct career paths for their 
employ- ees. For this study, Figure 1 will be used as a representative organizational struc- ture for 
a DP/MIS department. The position categories and the number of divisions in this organizational hierarchy 
are chosen to represent the broad spectrum of position titles used within organizations unde9 the four 
major functional characteristics of an DP/MIS department: operations, application development, computer 
system develop- ment and enhancement, and internal consultants/specialists. These broad categories are 
briefly defined in Figure 1 and are mapped to various position categories used by Datamation (10) in 
their annual survey (see Appendix). Research Objectives Using the career information provided by a 
select group of data processing professionals, the research will attempt to establish the validity of 
the following four career paths: i. Operatin 9 Personnel -# Operations Manager: While the organizational 
hierarchy implies a possible movement up the path to the MIS director from the Operations Manager rank, 
it is the author's hypothesis that such a movement will not occur because of the limited skills this 
path provides an individual to manage the entire MIS department. 2. Systems Programmer -~ Szstems_Manager 
T~ Internal Consultant: Here also the hypothesis relies on the general fact that this technically oriented 
path will not contribute professionals that are suitable for highly user oriented and poli- tical positions 
such as the MIS director. Due to the technical nature of the job, many may choose a specialist or consultant 
position as a capstone of their career.  3. Pro@rammer/Programmer Anal[st -~ Systems Anal[st -~ Applications 
Manager -% MIS Director: This path is hypothesized to be the most direct and logical path for one to 
the top MIS position. This is based on the fact that this path provides the most visibility and the greatest 
amount of user orientation. Management of computer users and data processing professionals is critical 
to the success of an individual in the director's position and this path can provide ample training to 
an individual seeking such a position.  4. Other Position -9 Internal Consultant/Specialist -~ Other 
Position: While this is not really a path, it does imply that the specialist role can be a valuable intermediate 
position which individuals may move to as they seek to change their career direction. This could also 
serve as a way of utilizing some technically skilled professionals in a consulting role rather than forcing 
them to move to a management position.  In addition to testing these four hypotheses, the study will 
attempt to answer the following questions: i. What background did these professionals have before entering 
DP and did this background have any affect on their first position in DP? 2. How frequently have these 
people changed their career paths and what are the most frequently used transition points as they changed 
careers? I m i s /dp ! l e:o i I operations int!rnal' " '' [' ' plications ! manager  [ sys~e!~'-'r

¢'r 3. How long did these professionals stay in their first jobs and is most of their movement up the 
career ladder within the same organization or through a change of the organization? Methodology Sample 
 The participants in the study were 145 members (return rate of about 30%) of two professional DP organizations, 
the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), located 
in Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Participants completed the survey questionnaire on a voluntary basis 
in exchange for a $5.00 honorarium and a copy of the survey findings. Individuals included in the sample 
were employees working mostly in one of the four occupational groups: analyst, programmer, manager, and 
specialist. The sample was chosen because it was expected to be representative of a national professional 
DP population with respect to relevant research characteristics (turnover rates, salary, age, education, 
type of employee, etc.). The average participant was a 35-year-old married male DP manager with a bachelor's 
degree. Since sample characteristics may be of interest to the reader, these are shown in greater detail 
in Tables 9-15 (see Appendix). Procedure A copy of the survey questionnaire, along with a cover letter 
and return envelope, was sent to the business address of DPMA and ACM members. Individuals were asked 
to participate in a survey of the job preferences and career paths of DP professionals being conducted 
by University researchers. The cover letter was jointly signed by the researchers and the officers of 
the two professional organizations. Individuals were told that participation would require approximately 
1-1/2 hours of their time over a six-month period, one hour to complete the initial questionnaire and 
thirty minutes for two telephone interviews conducted at three and six-month intervals. They also were 
assured extreme confidentiality of individual responses. Those persons desiring to participate were asked 
to mail the completed questionnaire to the researchers. Variable of Interest: position title: The position 
title assigned to each individual as they moved along their profession is derived from their "position 
title" and the "task description" -both part of the survey. This is necessary since many posi- tion titles 
by themselves do not reflect the tasks they are actually performing. Results Refer to Figure 2 and 
Table 2 for the following discussion on career paths. Figure 2 shows the original hierarchy shown in 
Figure 1 with the most frequent paths superim- posed. The box at each position shows the distribution 
of the incoming and the out- going professionals from that position. The shaded entry in the input (bottom 
portion of the box) represents the proportion that entered this position from non-DP ranks. The shaded 
portion on the output side (top portion of the box) represents the proportion that remained in this position 
at the time of the study. The dark lines show the most frequently observed paths and the dotted lines 
show the most frequent transfer points used for career change. Table 2 shows the complete list of all 
movements among various positions. The column corresponds to the positions an individual moved to and 
the row corresponds to the position from which the movement occurred. The diagonal element corresponds 
to the percentage that remained in a position after entering it. The top corner entry on each cell corresponds 
to the proportion that moved to the column position from the row position. The bottom corner entry corresponds 
to the significance of this movement to the column position in relation to all that passed through this 
rank. For example, in row 2 column i, 17% represents the number that moved from programmer/programmer 
analyst ranks to the systems programmer rank. However, this 17% constitutes about 79% of all those that 
entered the systems programmer rank. This implies that the programmer/programmer analyst is a very frequent 
entry point for those wanting to move into the systems programmer area. The last row and column corresponds 
to the total number that moved into and out of that position. Note also that the last but one row of 
Table 2 shows the contribution of the non-DP world to various positions both as a percentage of the sample 
that entered DP (top corner) and also as a percentage of those that passed through this position (bottom 
corner). For example, about 50% of all the people surveyed entered the programmer/programmer analyst 
rank, and this constitutes about 69% of all that passed through this rank (internal DP ranks and external 
non-DP ranks). It is inter- esting to note that while only 28% of those surveyed started their DP career 
as operating personnel, this amounts to 100% of all that passed through this rank, implying that there 
are no entries into this position from other DP ranks. The dis- cussion that follows uses the frequency 
distributions of the position changes to discuss the validity of the hypothesis. i. Operatin~ Personnel 
-9 Operations Manager: This path is not supported in the study. Of the 41 that entered the 'operating 
personnel' position, only 7% moved up to the 'operations manager' position. This amounted to only 16% 
of all those that passed through this 'operations manager' position. In contrast, over 65% of the 'operating 
personnel' moved to the 'programmer/programmer analyst' position. About 40% of those that held 'operations 
manager' rank and all those that held the 'operating personnel' rank came from non-DP ranks. The operations 
area may be a strong breeding ground for programmer/programmer analyst positions and an organization 
could possibly use this pool of profes- sionals to meet the programmer shortage. Since only a third of 
the operations managers remained in that position, it also can provide a pool of professionals to draw 
from. 2. Systems Programmer -~ Systems Manager -~ Internal Consultant/Specialist: This path is only 
partially supported. While 38% of the 'systems programmers' moved to consultant/ specialist' rank, over 
46% remained in the same position. There is not enough movement to the 'systems manager' position from 
the 'systems programmer' position to draw any conclusions. About 75% of those that entered the 'systems 
proframmer' position came from the 'programmer/programmer analyst' ranks and very few came from non-DP 
ranks. The technical nature of this path seems to attract those who want to stay in the systems design 
area rather than those who would like to move to management. The programmer/programmer analyst position 
could be used to identify those who prefer this type of a career path as an alternative to moving up 
to application management. 3. Programmer/Programmer Analyst -~ Systems Analyst -3 Application Mana@er 
-~ DP/MIS Director: This path is well supported even though the path between the application manager 
and MIS director is not very strong. Over 65% of those that entered the 'systems analyst' rank came 
from 'programmer/programmer analyst' rank. Over 70% of those that went on to become 'application managers' 
came from the ranks of both programmer/programmer analyst and the systems analyst. About half of the 
MIS directors came from the application path even though only a quarter of them came directly from the 
'application manager' rank. About 70% of the programmer/pro- grammer analyst ranks are filled by non-DP 
personnel, while only about 16% of the systems analyst ranks are filled from outside of DP. This path, 
by far, is the most ideal for training both technically oriented pro- fessionals and managers. Given 
that most of those that entered the 'operations' path and those that chose the 'systems' path used the 
programmer/programmer analyst rank as a transition point, this position does seem to play a vital role 
in channelling the individuals to various alternative career paths. 4. Other Position -3 Internal Consultant/Specialist 
-) Other Position: Most of the individuals that entered this position came from either the systems of 
the appli- cations path. However, about 25% of them also came from outside (non-DP ranks). Interestingly, 
about 60% remained in this position with about 13% moving up to the MIS director position. Due to the 
diversity of the tasks included under this category, it seems to attract a sizable number of non-DP personnel, 
thus providing anither career alternative for both the DP and non-DP professionals. Considering the number 
that chose to remain in this position, one may conclude that this could become a separate path an individual 
entering DP may consider even though this does not follow the tra- ditional DP tracks. Before leaving 
the discussion on career paths, it is useful to identify if the paths are different for those that joined 
the DP profession before and after the 70's, given the opportunities are much greater in the 70's due 
to the mini- and micro-computer evolution and the maturing of the software market. Figure 3 shows the 
paths of these groups. There is no noticeable difference between the paths followed by these groups 
except that the path between the programmer/programmer analyst and the systems analyst is much more pronounced 
in the 70's than in the earlier period. This could be attri- buted to a wider acceptance of the systems 
analyst position in the 70's as a stepping stone to application management position. Entered DP Entered 
DP Before 70's After 70's Figure 3. A contrast of paths followed by the two groups Other Career Related 
Information: Refer to Tables 3 through 8 as we answer some questions posed earlier under our objectives. 
 1. What background did these professionals have before entering DP and did this background have any 
affect on their first position? Table 3 illustrates the background of the DP professionals before entering 
DP and Table 4 shows where they started to establish their DP career. People with scientific and teaching 
backgrounds along with students form the significant pool from which the DP profession got their entrants. 
There is an increase of those with management back- ground in the 70's, possibly due to the management 
emphasis placed on incoming DP professionals. The starting position for many of those with scientific 
backgrounds and students seems to be the programmer/programmer analyst type, while relatively greater 
numbers of them (from teaching and student ranks) in the 70's are going to consulting/specialist ranks. 
A greater number of clerical personnel are starting as "operating personnel" with a significant chance 
of eventually entering the programmer/ programmer analyst ranks. Table 5 shows the distribution of first 
positions held by all the members of the sample. In general the professionals that entered DP after the 
60's seem to enjoy a variety of entry opportunities into a DP profession, and this trend will continue 
in the coming decades an the information revolution becomes much more widespread and the employment opportunities 
become more diverse. 2. How frequently have these people changed their career paths and, if so, what 
are the most frequently used transition points as they changed their career? The most frequent transition 
point in the "operations path" has been the "operating personnel" position allowing an individual to 
move up or move to "systems programming" rank in the systems path and "programmer" rank in the application 
path. The "program- mer/programmer analyst" position is a dominant transition point in the application 
path contributing most to the systems path via "systems programmer" positions, and of course, to its 
own path. The "internal consultant/specialist" position also is playing a dominant role by allowing systems 
programmers to remain, by making new entrants use this as an entry point to the application path, and 
by allowing members in the application path to use this as a stepping stone to move to the MIS/DP director 
position. 3. What is the relative tenure of a DP professional in a position and how is this affected 
by any individual background? Table 6 and Table 7 show the relative tenure of the DP professionals in 
their first position. About 70% of those that entered DP after the 60's stayed only about 2 years in 
their first position in comparison with 50% for those that entered DP before the 70's. While this is 
disheartening to many organizations, it can be attributed to the expanded opportunities in the computer 
industry in the 70's. In general, this initial tenure does not seem to be dependent on their entry position.

Table 8 provides some descriptive statistics on the number of years a DP professional stayed in the ist 
and 2nd jobs, longest tenure with an organization in their DP career, number of position changes within 
an organization, and number of position changes through new placement (leaving one organization and joining 
another). Only about 25% of the DP professionals remained within a company with over 3 position changes, 
and only 50% remained within a company with one position change. This implies that while an individual 
carved out a path over several years, half of the sample has done this career planning by moving to a 
different organization. This could be attributed possibly to a lack of flexible career planning made 
available to individuals within many of these organizations. Conclusions Career planning as a process 
has received much less attention in the DP literature as a variable that can affect the turnover behavior 
of DP professionals. As a process, sound career planning should provide the individual with the feeling 
that he or she bleongs and can identify with a company, a profession, a department, a team or a project. 
Studies have shown that such an identity is important to achieve individual committment to an organization. 
This paper studied the career planning of individuals over two decades, first to understand the frequent 
career paths of these professionals and then to draw some general conclusions about these paths. Future 
research should attempt to relate career pathing to the turnover behavior to see if proper career planning 
can in fact reduce turnover. The study here revealed that most of the professionals followed certain 
career paths, but in many cases this was done via a change in the organization. Assuming there are four 
paths in a DP organization: Operations, Systems, Applications, and Specialists, there is a significant 
movement across the paths. Most of the people entering the 'operations' path seem to move to the 'application' 
path and most of those that entered the 'systems' path came from the 'application' path. This makes the 
'application' path and, especially, the 'programmer/programmer analyst' position an important transition 
point to all DP careers observed. The 'application' path is observed to be the most likely path to train 
the MIS directors. The 'specialist' path seemed to gain popularity in the 70's as an entry point to an 
eventual DP career. This is also attracting a number of technically oriented professionals that prefer 
to stay close to the technical path they chose rather than move to a management position. The study 
also shows that the DP professionals are willing to move in and out of different career paths rather 
frequently. This implies two things. It is possible that the DP professionals do not have any idea what 
career path is most suitable for them. It is also possible that a lack of flexible career planning in 
an organization may be allowing an individual to try other organizations, and in turn, different paths. 
The first problem could be attributed to the relative infancy of data processing as a profession and 
a lack of well defined career paths for DP professionals. The paths identified here can serve as a starting 
point for generating even more career paths so an individual's skills can be used most effectively. The 
second problem can be attributed to the quickness with which an organization is willing to look outside 
for help rather than from its own professional staff. The career path transfers show that many operating 
personnel are willing to move to the application path and many in the application path are willing to 
move to the systems path if opportunities arise. This should give enough inducement to organizations 
to train their internal staff in other areas to provide them job-enrichment as well as alternative career 
paths. References <RefA>1. Acker, R.S., Turning around Turnover, Data Management, March, 1981, 19, 44-6.
