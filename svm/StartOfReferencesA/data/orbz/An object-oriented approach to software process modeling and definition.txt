Object-Oriented Systems Analysis (OSA) (Embley et al. 1992), and DRAGOON (Atkinson 1991a), an Object 
Oriented Programming Language with clear, Ada-like syntax, to software process modeling. Models are developed 
which utilize encapsulation and inheritance to reduce complexity and enhance clarity. The use of an Object-Oriented 
Programming language lends the power of polymorphism, inheritance and dynamic binding to the process 
descriptions. Most software process modeling methods adopt a functional orientation. Control and data 
flows are depicted through a method and notation similar to functional techniques ( e.g. structured rmalysis/design) 
used in software development (Curtis et al. 1992). These techniques exhibit many of the same deficiencies 
when applied to process modeling that they exhibit when applied to sotlware development. In particular

to models which effectively encapsulate precess steps and the data they act on. They lack a mechanism, 
such as inheritance, to effectively exploit the ecmunonality which exists among various process steps. 
These deficiencies result in a model which is more complex than is neeessary and difficult to reuse and 
modi~. Many methods poorly represent the potential concurrency and iteration present in the process. 
Other methods utilize specirdized programming techniques (Peuschel et al. 1992). Others use techniques 
tlom classical process control, such as system dynamics, feedback control, or steady state crdculations 
(Weber 1973) which are not widely understcxxl in the software engineering community or not directly applicable 
to software development. I attempt to use a notation which, as tie strong thrwst toward 00A/OOD continues, 
should beeome easily accessible to most practicing software engineers and technically competent managers. 
The development of expertise in 00A/OOD and object-oriented process modeling would be mutually re-enforcing. 
SOFTWARE PROCESS MODELING AND ENACTMENT Interest in software processmedeling and enactment is inspired 
by two related factors. First, software development organizations have a great interest m defting their 
software development process in order to unprove productivity and quality, and to demonstratea maturity 
and capability level which is acceptable to their customers (Humphrey 1989). Secondly, there is a recognizedneed 
for processdriven software lifeeycle support environments providing some measure of automated process 
enactment(bfi and Scacehi 1992). Effective prwess modeling techniques are an essential precursor to the 
production of such environments. Currently there is often a lack of fidelity between actual behavior 
and an organization s stated process. This is caused by high level processes, mandated by customers or 
management outside the actual development organization, that are unrelated to actual activities. Descriptions 
of processes are imprecise, ambiguous, incomprehensible, or unusable and are not updated as processes 
change (Curtis et al. 1992). Process Enactment is implementing a procas model to produce a product or 
service. Process Enactment Support c+in range from manual document based process descriptions to active 
process enactment support, including proactive process management of prccess artifacts and activities 
based on understanding of user roles and knowledge of software process (Over 1993). The benefits of highly 
automated support can include greater standardization of process among individuals and teams, enforcement 
and verification of the process, and the unobtrusive collection of metrics allowing the study and improvement 
of the process. Strict, detailed process enactment through exclusively manual means is difficult, cmstly, 
time consuming, and distracts developers from their main task of developing or maintaining sotlware. 
A Process Driver, which maps the process model to the physical support environment, can greatly reduce 
the burdens of exclusively manual enactment. An ideal modeling technique would produce models which .wamIessly 
interfam with the Process Driver and project data objects allowing easy implementation of automated enactment. 
Various approaches to sotlware process modeling are described in (Fernstrom et al. 1992), (Mi and Scacchi 
1992), (Cap Gemini 1992), (Bradfield 1992), (Sutton et al. 1990), (Osterweil 1987), (Gorlick 1991), (Dutton 
1993), and (Aoyama 1993). DRAGOON DRAGOON is a programming language, developed by a European Esprit project, 
which attempts to combine the best features of Ada and object-oriented programming to provide a practical 
vehicle for encouraging reuse and distribution in large­scale software systems (Atkinson 1991b). This 
language enriches Ada with the main features of the object-oriented paradigm presented in a style conforming 
to Ada s syntactic conventions. It can be transformed automatically into standard Ada 83 thus offering 
all the advantages of Ada portability and stability. DRAGOON extends the traditional view of inheritance 
to handle aspects of concurrency and distribution. Dragoon is a mixed paradigm language. It uses all 
of Ada s typing facilities, as well as packages, subprograms, exceptions, and many other features. This 
allows the programmer to take advantage of existing Ada software not necessarily witten according to 
the object-oriented approach. The design of the object-oriented f=tures of DRAGOON has been inspired 
by the language Eiffel developed by Meyer (1989). DRAGOON provides multiple, static inheritance with 
facilities for deferring and redefining methods, and relies on the subclass hierarchy to determine assignment 
compatibility, It also supports generic classes, which can be parametensed with res~ct to data or class 
types, and allows inheritance of generic classes. DRAGOON differs more significantly from Eiffel and 
other object-oriented Ada extensions such as Classic-Ada, Innovada, and Ada++, in its support for concurrency 
and distribution. DRAGOON classes may be either active or passive. AU object of an active class has an 
independent thread of control which allows it to execute concurrently with other objects. Synchronization 
is achieved through behaviors which are imposed through a form of inheritance, eliminating the need for 
low-level mechanisms such as semaphores. Ditibution is achieved through the use of executable objects 
and the concept of virtual nodes (Atkinson et al. 1988). More details of the language artd its implementation 
can be found in (DiMai 1988). A description of Object-Oriented System Analysis may be found in (Embly 
1992). MODELING BASIC LIFE CYCLE CONCEPTS Figure 1 presents an object relationship model &#38;scribing 
some essential life cycle concepts. A SLCM consists of 1 or more Phases. Each Phase is composed of 1 
or more Teams (sets of Roles) and 1 or more Activities. Artifact Templates are created by a Phase and 
stored in the Artifact_Base. Each Artifact is produced by an Activity. An Activity may or may not produce 
an Artifact. Teams Frform Activities. Teams are composed of m Artifact Phase CreateWodifles, Views 1 
T 1 isAssigned Il. Employee ~kl Figure 1. Essential Life Cycle Concepts Roles, and to each Role M assigned 
an Employee. By remaining limited to a restricted number of basic classes and creating other classes 
and objects from them, it is possible to maintain a strongly typed structure and still minhize complexities 
of analysis and manipulation. For example all artifacts mav be stored in and retrieved from an object 
base as artifacts but then be used based on the properties of the subclass to which they belong. 17 We 
now extend the basic conceptsos necessmyto allow the representation of a simple development model, and 
then demonstratethemodel sextendibility tomorerealisticmodels. SIMPLE DEVELOPMENT MODEL Figure 2 provides 
extensions to the flmdamental concepts necessary to present a simple life cycle model. This simple model 
is composed of 3 phases: design, code, and test (Figure 3). (Note This is a grossly simplified example 
for illustrative purposes, NOT a proposal for actual software development) Each phase will be performed 
exactly once. The purpose of the model is to design, code and test one unit of code. &#38;&#38; nTeam

would be to create a class REVIEW which inherits ACTIVITY and then define DESIGN_REVIEW as a subclass 
of REVIEW. This would allow the commomlity of all types of reviews to be abstracted and captured in one 
class. Then specific reviews (design, code, etc.) would speci~ information unique to that class of review. 
A major requirement for improving process maturity is the collection of metrics describing the efficiency 
of process activities and the quality of products produced. DRAGOON can readily be used to define and 
instrument metric collection points. DRAGOON provides substantial support for describing necessary or 
potential concurrency in the execution of active objects. Synchronization may be provided by normal progr 
amming constructs or through behaviors which allow inheritance of fimctionrdity and synchronization to 
be separated. Many SLCM S are iterative. Sothvare maybe deliberately developed in increments. Errors 
or requirement changes may require the re-iteration of an earlier phase or activity. The ability to create 
and maintain multiple objects of an activity or phase class provides an original way of representing 
iteration. PROCESS EXAMPLE PROBLEM In this section the modeling approach is applied to the analysis and

The approach to sotlware process modeling presented in this paper appears to be an effective way to develop 
clear and useful models. These models share the advantages of object­oriented software. They can be easily 
moditied or extend~ and can be viewed at appropriate levels of abstraction. A fidl-f=tured, executable 
programmingg language is an excellent tool for modeling the software promss. This is particularly true 
when the language, such as DFL4GOON, has high level constructs that allow the overall process structure 
to be clearly viewed. Using a progr runming language to model processes facilitates the development of 
automated simulation and analysis, as well as automated enactment. The Object-Oriented nature of the 
model facilitates the gradual development of precise models as the analysis of individual activities 
becomes more mature. A four step approach of is advocated in this paper: 1, Develop Object Relationship 
Model, 2. Develop DRAGOON specifications of each class, 3. Develop Object-Behavior Models and DRAGOON 
bodies to a level of detail appropriate for the particular modeling task, 4. Develop Object-Interaction 
Models to analyze the overall process and revise if necessruy. This approach may by applied recursively 
from the highest level view, to as detailed a representation as required.  Four areas in which the Object-Oriented 
analysis methcd may be applicable include the development of an abstract theory of software process, 
formal methods of sothvare process deftition and analysis, simulation of sdtware process, and the development 
of automated enactment support. There is no universally recognized theory of software process. The SEI 
CMM as well as work by the Sotlware Productivity Consortium and the STARS program have been widely read 
and followed. None of these organizations, however, has produced what might be called a comprehensive 
theory of software process. The Object-Oriented Approach provides an excellent tool for the abstract 
analysis of software process. The essential life cycle features identified represent one attempt at beginning 
such an analysis. Generally a field of study is developed by amassing a large body of practical knowledge 
and experience, analyzing it, forming and testing hypotheses, and finally developing an overall abstract 
theory which accounts for the observed data. Occasionally, as in the application of certain abstract 
mathematical ideas, a general theory is developed which later is found to be directly applicable to a 
practical situation. Much software process work seems to have been done in a strange middle-out approachbasedneither 
on detaded analysis of actual experience, nor on a sound abstract theory. Rather, it is based on a general, 
non-rigorous examination of anecdotal experience. Rigorous Object-Oriented Analysis may help alleviate 
tis deficiency. OSA and DRAGOON provide a rigorous, though informal, notationforexpressingandanalyzingsoftwareprocess; 
Capturing processknowledge in this rigorous format can provide a basis for analysis which may lead to 
a distillation of features which are amenableto formal analysis, and provide a basis for a formal notationtocapturethesef=tures. 
An implementation of an SLCM captured in DRAGOON is readily amenable to graphical animation or to the 
simulated enactment of potential scenarios. Such animation or simulations can allow the analysis of propaed 
models prior to their enactment. The potentird exists for linking DRAGOON mcdels to existing process 
drivers. Tools providing automated traceability between OSA models and DRAGOON code could be developed 
to facilitate the capture and maintenance of process models, The choice of the particular tools, OSA 
and DRAGOON, was somewhat arbitrary. The intent was to demonstrate the feasibility of an Object-Oriented 
approach in contrast to previous fimctioml approaches. Other analysi.ddesign methods, particularly newer 
methods such as Fusion, may have additional advantages when applied to SoRware Process Mcdeling. An obvious 
candidate for a deftition capture language is Ada 9X although the author believes DRAGOON has several 
advantages over 9X for this application. BIBLIOGRAPHY <RefA>Atkinson, C,, 1991a. Obiect-Qkmked R­ . . . ~.
