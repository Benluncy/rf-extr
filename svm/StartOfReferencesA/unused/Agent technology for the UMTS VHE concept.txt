However, the fiture tel~ommunications world wi~ not be homogeneous, and therefore these gords cannot

network to obtain information about the user s service provider during the registration prmdure and other 
information such as the user s personrdisd service profile and the identification of service capabilities 
neded for the execution of service provider specific services. Mthough the physical rdisation of a service 
may difier from one network to another, the W concept enabl~s the user to auess and to use the service 
in the same way on any network, see Figure 2. The W is currently Wing standardised in ETSI SMG 1 and

VHE concept This flexibility will allow service providers and network operators to compete on the basis 
of proprietary services and provide great benefit to the user in terms of service choice and service 
persondisation. 5. AGE~ ~C~OLOGY The term agent has become a hot topic over the last years in the hformation 
Technology ~ world as well as in the telecommunication world. However, a commonly agrd definition of 
what an agent is, cannot be given at tils time. We propose the fo~owing well-developed definition An 
agent is aptice of so@are, which is able to peflorm a specific predefine task ationomously (on behalf 
of a user or an application). An agent is either stationaq providing zhe necessaq tieUigence, or mobih 
so that it can move behveen &#38;stribtied (possibly incompatible) systems to access remote resources 
or even meet other agents (or activa~e them). All agents have capabilities to co-ordinate, communicate 
d co-operate with the system or \w th other agents. A common approach is to define agents by their attributes, 
such as autonomy, intelligence, mobltity, etc. From very a high level perspective two major types can 
be identified ~fag96]: . lfobde Agents, in which the mobtity of code. data and state is the most fidarnenti 
attribute. ~Is tiows software entities to roam autonomously through a network and to perform dedicatd 
tasks at spec%c network nodes, thereby tilng advantage of locdi~, . hte~gent Agents, which are software 
entities that are able to perform delegatd tasks basal on intemrd knowldge and reasoning, where aspects 
such as inter-agent communication and negotiation are findamenti. Ustily mobifity is not considered as 
an issue. 5.1 Agent Pro~g Lan~agw The most important pro~armning languages that supporting the agent 
concepts are JAVA, TCL ~ool Command kguage] and APU (Agent PRocess htemet Language). The platform independence 
of the JAVA language [Jav98] makes it a perfect language to develop agent-based tools. For example, ~Ms 
Aglet Workbench, providw a lahratory for creating JAVA-based agent applications. TCL ~CL98] is a popular 
public domain interpreted language developed by John Ousterhout. It was originally designd as a language 
to control various applications and rdlow them to communicate. TCL is a script language and definitely 
more user friendly than JAVA. TC~K was developed for rapid prototyping and G~ development. Safe-Tel is 
one extension for running agents. Apfl is a programming language developed at Fujitsu bbs and specifically 
designed for building MAS (Multi Agent Systems) which execute over the Internet. Agents are built as 
a set of layers on top of the April language. April provid~ a set of basic features rdlowing the creation 
of concurrent prmesses, TCP~ based communication between them, high-level communication primitives, !ist 
data structures etc. 5.2 Agent Comuimtion Lan~agw While the languages mentioned so far are all programming 
languages, KQ~ &#38;QM98] and ACL [ACL98] are examples for a communication protocol for exchanging information 
and knowledge. Both the message format and the message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge 
sharing among agents are covered. h contrast to the traditional RPC-based paradigm the ACL as defined 
by ~A provides an attempt at a universal message-oriented communication language. The ~A ACL describes 
a standard way to package messages, in such a way that it is clear to other compliant agents what the 
purpose of the communication is. Mthough there are severrd hundred verbs in English, which correspond 
to perforrnativa, the ACL defina what is considered to k the minimal set for agent communication ~A ACL 
consists of 20 performatives). This method provides for a flexible approach for communication btween 
software entities exhibiting benefits including: dynamic introduction and removal of servic~; . customised 
services can be introduced without a requirement to re-compile the code of the clients at run-timq rdlow 
for more de-centrrdised peer-peer realisation of software, . a universal message based language approach 
providing consistent sp=h-act based interface throughout software (flat hierarchy of interfaces); asynchronous 
message-based interaction between entities. 50 .  .. ... . .­ .. ,..­ ,. -e.-­ .- In order for an 
agent designed for a given application domain to communicate with an agent from another application domain 
it must understand the ontolo=~ used in fiat other application domain. Udess an agent is using lining 
techniques, extending the agents ontology rquires the agent to be recompiled and this suffers similar 
drawbacks to modi~ng an APL 5.3 Agent Pktiom Platforms for service provisioning are continuously evolving. 
However, the evaluation of the application of Agent Twhnolo=~ for the purpose of protiding Service utilquity 
has to be shown on an existing platform. Besides protiding a system development infrastructure the existing 
platfoms, dso called mobile agent systems, support securi~, inter-agent communication, agent transport 
protocols. remote messaging, etc. Several platforms are available but most of these products are in their 
Beta stages. Some of the JAVA-based mobile fiarneworks avtiable are (1) Aglets WorMench from ~hf, (2) 
Voyager born Obj~t Space, (3) Concordia from hfitsubishi Electric, (4) Ageti TCL from Dartmouth College, 
(5) Odyssey horn General Magic, (5) CyberAgent from ~ Software, (6) Grasshopper from N, and (7) JMC from 
the Technical University of Berlin. A 5rst evaluation with respect to the advantagddisadvantages, stabifity, 
availability, portabihty et~ of these candidates has shown that the Object Space Voyager [Obj9S] platform 
offers a promising approach. Voyager is a JAVA-based zgent-enhan~ Objat Request Broker (O=). It does 
not use ~ to move agents, instead it has its own object transport mechanism which, as claimed, mkes it 
faster than RML Voyager rdso providm ORB functionrdhy that means remote objects can communicate in a 
unified environmen~ Voyager Mows JAVA objects to roam a network and continue to execute as they move. 
And since an agent is just a special kind of objec~ moving agents and other objects can exchange remote 
messages using re@ar JAVA message syntax. With Voyager a single command automatidy enables any JAVA class 
without dtenng the class for distributed computing. Voyager can remotely mnsmct ~d communicate with any 
JAVA class, even 3rd party tibraries without sourm. Once creatd one may move any sen~lsable objmt to 
a new location, even wtie the object is r-iving messages. Messages sent to the old location are automaticMy 
forwarded to the new location. Voyager is small. me entire Voyager system is less th~ 150 kbyte (uncompressed). 
It is a Wly functioned agent-enhanced ORB, and does not rquire any additiond software beyond the JAVA 
Development =t (JDQ 1.1. Future versions will include a distributed event system, group communications, 
a distributed dir=tory service, store-and­ .. . forward, reliable UDP communications, mobile tracking 
facilitim, and enhanced agent capabilities. These JAVA based platforms allow to create portable objects 
and easily distribute them and they are well suited for new developments that need only c~operate with 
existing software in a limited way. CORBA based agent platforms such as Grasshopper from KV, have the 
advantage that systems in other languages can be integrated using the Interface Definition Language (DL) 
of CORBA, thus allowing the integration of legacy systems, database systems, and objects and applications 
titten in other languagm. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantage and it is the goal of CAMELEON 
to use both platform types in the prototyping to allow a well founded judgement on the applicability 
and interoperabllity of these platforms for ubiquitous tele­communication services of the VHE type. 5.4 
Agent Stidardisation Several standardisation goups have been founded to specify and standardise agents 
and their use under a different focus, including the Object Management Group (OMG), the Foundation of 
Physical fnteltigent Agents WA), and the Agent Society. OMG [OMG9S] has submitted a Mobile Agent Facility 
mAn specification. This specification focuses on interoperabllity between the different agent platforms 
mentioned in the previous chapter. The goal of the MAF is to accelerate the use of mobile agents by maximizing 
interoperabllity between mobile agent systems while minimizing the impact of the standardised elements 
on any particular system. hteroperability allows agents to visit more sites because they are not limited 
by the incompatibility between disparate mobile agent systems. ~A ~9S] is an internationrd non-profit 
association of compani= and organisations that have agrd to share efforts in specifications of generic 
agent technology= and focus on inte~igent agents. Only static intelligent agents are considered at the 
fist stage, whereas agent mobility (although considerd as king interesting for some apphcation contexts) 
will be considered in the future. The Agent Society [AS9S] is an international industry and professionrd 
organisation establish at the end of 1996 to assist in the wid=pread development and emergence of htemet 
related agent tahnologies and markets. The members of this non-profit consortium consist of leading compani= 
and hstitutions in the agent field. In contrast to ~A the Agent Society is primarily concerned with raising 
the awareness of Agent Technology by providing opportunities for the industry to mmt and discuss issues 
of common intermt, and not with producing the specifications. -. . , . . t.  -. ;---­ !.. $ \­. ,­

and ,. !. platform 2005 using Grasshopper. The service architecture for platform 2000 is dacribed in 
the following. .,. .. 6.1 NM Sefice ArcMtectire Besides using the agent platform Voyager. other , . 
extensions of Java will be used for the implementation of :. the APM service, e.g. JTAPI (JAVA Telephony 
APQ and ~ (JAVA Native hterface AP~. The APM server will be composd of thrw main components. The fist 
part contains a communication manager handling the incoming telephone and fax calls which is connected 
to the network. The second part is a se cad ktemet service node consisting of several Java moddes such 
as, m server, M server, ~P CtientiServer; and S=~OP3 clientiserver. This part performs dl activities 
concerning the Internet applications. The third part is the agency with the underlying Voyager mobile 
agent platform, see figure 4. The telephony services of the communication manager will be implemented 
by using JTAPI which consists of different packages: . The core package defines three methods to support 
its primary features: placing a telephone crdl, -, ,answering a telephone crdl, and disconnecting a connection 
to a telephone cdl. . The CM control package extends the core package by providing more advanced crdl-control 
features such as placing calls on hold, transferring telephone ctis, and conferencing telephone calls. 
 ,-­ . .. --; -:­ The cdl centre package provid= applications the abifity to perform advand features 
necessary for managing large cdl centres. Examples of these advanced features include Routing, Automatd 
Cdl Distribution (ACD), Predictive Cfling, and associating application data with telephony objects. . 
The media Package provides applications access to the mda streams associatd with a telephone cd. They 
are able to read and write data from these media streams. DTMF (touch-tone) and non-DTMF tone detection 
and generations is dso provided in the Java telephony media package. . The telephony phone package permits 
applications to control the physicrd features of telephone hardware phone sets. tiplementations may describe 
Terminals as collections of components, where each of these component-types has interfaces in this package. 
 The telephony applications implemented by using JTAPI are hardware-independent and can be used on any 
platform with the assumption that the implementation of JTAPI methods for the corresponding Telephony 
WI (e.g. S~ XT, TSAPI, hIS TAPL CAPI etc.) are avtiable on tils platform. An implementation of JTAPI 
methods for the S~ ZT crdld Javatel is ti=dy ammpfished by sm. For the APhf server we will implement 
the rquird ~API methods on top of hlS TAPI. Sinm the MS TAPI functions are Windows-specific they can 
only be accessed by the ~~1 over the Java Native C hterface, see Fi=we 4. The htemet service node consisting 
of the Java moddes, mentioned above, is on the one hand responsible for handing and management of incoming 
and outgoing emails, on the other hand it provides the possibility to access the APhf server via the 
ktemet regardess of the underlying platform by using Java Applets and W. The Java-based mobile agents 
on the top of tie Voyager platfom such as the G~ agen~ user notification agen~ profile agen~ etc. will 
bring the rquired services to the user depending on tie currentiy end-device which is currentiy ~xng

a number of communication devices, e.g. PCs, PDAs, residential phones, desktops and mobfle phones, most 
of which mntain or provide a=s to an address bk service. The service offerd is generally Mted in usabitity 
or flexibility for even ttiay s mmmunication requirements. For exmple, mobiles generally have devim resident

_ _., ,. .,: time. A desktop PC may provide access to company employee names and telephone numbers via 
a platform specific application or more recendy via an Intranet, but til rquire the user to launch a 
separate application for storing personal address book information. Communication between these applications 
on different devica is not currendy possible. h today s scenarios the user has no choice but to replicate 
address book data across different applications and to deal manually with any data inconsistencies [CM8]. 
 The Virtual Address Book NAB) service will allow a WS user to use several different types of terminals 
to access and update user data. These terminals will have different degr= of computing and communication 
resources and may be located at geographically distant locations or maybe used while roaming in the home 
or a visitd WS network. It will k the responsibility of the agent architecture for this service to provide 
a consistent view of user data irrespective of the location, database, terminrd type, and network configuration. 
The agent architecture will dso have to deal with the problem of information consistency and will address 
the relatd aspects of confict resolution, locking capability and shared access to address book information. 
One of the key chrdlenges of this service will be to provide an effective interworking betw=n existing 
persistent-storddatabase. Mobile agents will bean elegant solution,s= Figure 5. The architecture for 
the VAB service will consist of mdtiple collaborating agents to provide a flexible solution for the information 
consistency pioblem, which is the key issue for the VAB service. htroducing agents in this architecture 
provides additiond value to the functionality offerd by the persistent storage technologia that will 
be used to provide this service. This added value is achieved by the intelligence of the agents that 
consider user preferenm, service features, terrninrd and communication characteristics. The key advantagm 
in this regard are the following: A large distributed and heterogeneous sy~tem such as WS will use a 
variety of persistent storage technologi~. hterworking between these technologies will be dificult. The 
database agents eliminate this problem by providing an optimisd solution that is achieved by collaboration 
between agents representing these technologies. For example, a user uses a file system to store information 
on his mobile terminal and an object-oriented (00) database on his home PC. In order to get updatd information 
on his mobile terminal the file system agents can provide adapter functionality that facilitat~ the negotiation 
with agents managing information in the 00 database.  An agent solution has a special advantage in wireless 
situations where bandwidth is scarce and costiy. For example, a mobile user wotid like to get an updatd

it initiates appropriate agents to faditate and coordinate to accomplish this task Database agents make 
the V-servim independent of the persistent storage technolo=q used in a terminal. The servim and agent 
infrastructure levels are layerd on top of a software environment fi.e. a base framework) for the terminal 
device. For this prototype, this entionment is structural to provide a JAVA-basal mobde agent framework 
(e.g., Voyager, S= smtion 2.2). The persistent storage m~hanism used cotid vary from terminal type to 
terminal type. ,., ,.S , . -A: .,.--. , . - This architmture reflmts a p~r-t~peer scenario. For a client-server 
configuration the agent infrastructure layer will be split and some components will be movd to the server 
(network) side. Depending upon the functionality that the server side needs to handle most of the database 
,. agents are relmatd at the server side to handle rquests , from multiple clients. The server architmture 
needs dso to be ~uippd with additiond functionality (e.g. load balancing, high availability, fault tolerance) 
to handle mtitiple rquests from different client terminals. One of the biggest advantag~ of mobile agents 
in this architecture is that this relmation of infrastructure layer agents at the server side could be 
achieved at run time to provide adaptive system configuration, a key characteristic for ,. achieving 
a ~. ... 8. CONCLUSION Theprovision of personalisd tel~ommunication services to subscribers in any network 
is a tough problem that is intensified when those subscribers are mobile and may wish to access the servic= 
from many different networks. The service investigations lead to the conclusion that the -concept can 
be best implemented by using Agent Technology. Furthermore, the combination of the ~ concept and Agent 
T&#38;hnology allows asy and rapid development of new sophisticated teleservices. The fusibility of the 
approach is Wing investigated within the Europ=n ACTS project C=UON [CW98], where the desmibed servicm 
as well as a s~called Hexible Financial Service are king implemented and proved on two platforms rdlowing 
comparisons and the development of interoperability as well as migration strategies. Early results underline 
that the servica d=cribed as well as the concept of the ~ show a high potential of koming mmrnercidly 
relevant, and the application of Agent T~hnology in mobile telmommunication networks solves many of the 
shortcomings of these networks, such as the Iimitd bandwidth, the unavailability of home services, and 
the high communication costs. 9. R~WNC~ [22.01] ETSI TS 22.01. Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
