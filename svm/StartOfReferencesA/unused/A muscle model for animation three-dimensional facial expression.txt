that incorporates the use of a model to cream realistic facial animation is described. Existing methods 
of facial parametedzation have the inherent problem of hard-wiring performable actions. The development 
of a muscle process that is controllable by a limited number of parameters and is non-specific to facial 
topology allows a richer vocabulary and a more general approach to the modelling of the primary facial 
expressions. A brief discussion of facial structure is given, from which a method for a simple modelling 
of a muscle process that is suitable for the animation of a number of divergent facial types is described.

/ O07 [O017 $00.75 1. Introduction There are two fundamental approaches to three-dimensional facial animation: 
key framing and parameterization [4][7]. Each has been exploited with varying degrees of success, but 
both have drawbacks. Key framing requires the complete specification of the model at each extreme, or 
at least the storage of the differences between facial positions [15]. Additionally, any unique subtle 
movement of the face must be constructed as a complete model, with the result that key framing is data-intensive 
and lacks specific manipulation. Parameterization avoids this problem of rigidity by grouping vertices 
together to preform specified tasks. However, generality is lost as soon as the process is applied to 
a new facial topology. Only by maintaining the same topological mesh will the parameterization hold tn/e. 
Investigation by Parke [4] on the conformation of faces deals with the problem of utilizing these constraints, 
but it is doubtful whether the generality of such a topology will hold true over a wider range of facial 
types. Facial parameterization techniques have dealt principally with the surface characteristics of 
the skin and have not been concerned with the motivators of the dynamics. Investigations by Badler [ 
1] into the structural bases for the upper face dealt with the elastic nature of muscle and skin. The 
process is iterative in nature and deals adequately with the motivators of the actions. However, the 
complexities of the lower face jaw rotations render the processes unperformable. It is evident from such 
investigations that the motivators of the dynamic characteristics are complex, and that a simple and 
more general approach needs to be taken if muscle parameterization is to st~cceed. This present research 
is concerned with the development of a more general and flexible muscle model for parameterization that 
will allow facial control without the requirement for hard-wiring the performable actions. 2, Motivation 
The diversity of facial forms in terms of sex, age and race is enormous. It is these forms that allow 
us to recognize individuals and send complex non- verbal signals to one another. For the deaf and hard-of-hearing 
the face is a vital mode of communication, with the majority of attention placed on the observation of 
the lips [16][11]. As a result, a variety of models have been developed to imitate the actions of the 
lips [13]. Evidence from reasearch by Quentin Summerfield [17] for the deaf and hard- of-heuring has 
shown that real people speaking are unsatisfactory subjects for experiments into visual speech perception, 
because real people cannot produce specific and graded articulatory gestures. Furthermore it is evident 
that bi- or multi-modal emphasis in teaching the deaf tip reading should not be undervalued, as we are 
predisposed to relate what we hear to what we see. Computer pre-operative surgical techniques need to 
determine the mobility remaining in the face after surgery. Surgical reconstruction of faces [20] uses 
a number of techniques to collect three-dimensional data: Moire patterning, lofting of CAT or EMR scans 
and lasers. The resultant data can vary enormously from one face to another, and so any resultant parameterization 
would, at best, be tedious to implement. [7  SIGGRAPH '87, Anaheim, July 27-31, 1987 I~~1 The facial 
muscle process described in this paper avoids direct hard-wiring of performable actions to the data slructure, 
and offers a simple method to determine the motional bounds of the key facial nodes. 3. Developing parameter 
sets for the face Parameterization is the most desirable method of generating and controlling complex 
articulated models. Isolating the appropriate parameters to use for the face is perplexing but fundamental. 
Inanimate objects, such as the geometric primitives, "cube, cone, sphere", can be described in terms 
of width, length, height, diameter, coloar, weight and material, that represent basic parameters. The 
advantage of this approach allows concise criteria to encapsulate every member of that group or class. 
Few living forms can be determined by such precise parameters. Trees [3] and other recursively generated 
forms seem to be the only objects belonging to such bounded sets, and consequently they can be created 
from a small kernel of data that is easy to produce. Unfortunately the inherent nature of the face does 
not allow the formation of such discrete criteria, where the terminating description of an unbounded 
class becomes vague and is usually discerned by the resulting visual image. The Minimum Set System [19] 
accepts the complexities of the unbounded class and describes the smallest number of parameters required 
to preform definable facial expression. It remains very difficult to extract the necessary facial parameters 
from real faces. The individual facial muscles beneath the skin (and the deeper layered muscle) have 
not been accurately measured. Work by the nineteeth century physiologist Duchenne, applied electrical 
currents to freshly guillotined heads to observe the facial contortions. Later he applied the same techniques 
to old inmates of alms houses to create artificial expressions. In 1906 Sir Charles Bell, the anatomist, 
illustrated the mechanisms of the major expressions in his book Anatomy and Physiology of Expression, 
and, as he explained, a muhimde of processes coalesce to produce what we instinctively recognize as an 
expression. This being the case, it is still open to question as to whether there are techniques to extract 
the necessary facial parameters from actual faces. Investigations by Quentin Summerfield [17] into the 
perception of visible articulatory movements measured the face using video tape techniques. Three major 
problems were encountered. Firstly, an axis frame must be defined to which the measured movements may 
be referred. Secondly, movements of the primary articulators such as the lips and jaw must be separated 
from the effects of global movements. Thirdly, the measurements must be sensitive since, relative to 
the size of the head, significant articulatory excursions are small and seldom exceed about 25mm. Despite 
these inherent problems, reasonable results were obtained that describe the surface displacements of 
the skin. Figure 1 The Action Unit AU1 activates the inner brow miser pulling the inner frontalis muscle. 
This action, with the combination of wide eyelids, pupils dilated, jaw rotated and the angular depressor 
pulled, displays the appearance of fear.  Significant work by Paul Ekman and Wallice Friesden, psychologists 
of non-verbal communication, created The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [10], which is a notational-based 
environment that determines emotional states from the visible facial distortion. Individual muscles, 
or small groups of muscles, are described as Action Units (ALl) that distort the skin tissue. This appears 
to be the best technique for the extraction of facial parameters useful for computer synthesis. /  Figure 
2 The Action Unit AU9 activates the Levator labii superioris alaqne nasi muscle that runs from the zygomatic 
process to the upper lip. When it is activated the skin around the nose is pulled up dilating the nostrils 
and sometimes raising the upper lip. The fifty independent facial actions can give rise to to several 
thousands of muscle combinations. The facial muscles can be trained, but activating them alone is not 
visually communicative. Six categories are described by Ekman [9]: Anger, Fear, Suprise, Disgust, Happiness 
and Sadness. Each of these uses multiple combinations of the Action Units. For example, one activity 
of the upper face in Fig l operates AU1, the inner brow raiser by contracting the inner frontalis muscle. 
In fig 2 AU9 is used, known as the 'nose wrinkler', this activates the levator labii superioris alaqne 
nasi causing the nostrils to dilate, pulling the skin around the base of the nose up and sometimes raising 
the upper lip. My own research ascribes, to individual muscles, or groups of muscles, particular parameters 
that remain consistant between one face and the next, in the same way that FACS is universal across a 
spectrum of facial types. Importantly, any contradiction between FACS and the computer parameters can 
easily be compared and corrected using this principle of Action Units. The goal is to model the basic 
facial expressions described by Ekman using FACS to validate the results. 4. The muscle and bone of the 
face The cranium consists of fourteen major bones of which the manible is the only jointed structure. 
The mandible rotates horizontally about an axis near the ear. Inserted into the manible are the lower 
teeth, and the upper teeth are embeded into the maxilla process. From the front view, the teeth are the 
only visible bone structure, and should not be underestimated in the modelling of speech segments. The 
muscles of facial expression, are subcutaneous voluntary muscles. In general they arise from the bone 
or facia of the head, and insert into the skin as in Fig 3. The muscle can be defined according to the 
orientation of the fasciculi (the individual fibres of the muscle) that may be parallel/linear, oblique 
or spiralized relative to the direction of pull at their attachment. There are a variety of these muscle 
types apparent on the face and they can be broadly divided into the upper and lower face. In the lower 
face there are five major groupings: |8  ~ Computer Graphics, Volume 21, Number 4, July 1987 -Uppers 
and downers, that move the face upwards towards the brow and conversely towards the chin. Those that 
contract horizontally towards the ears and conversely towards the center line of the face.  Oblique 
muscles that contract in an angular direction from the lips, upwards and outwards to the cheek bones. 
 The orbitals that are circular or elliptical in nature, and run round the eyes and mouth.  Sheet muscle, 
that carries out miscellaneous actions, particularly over the temporal zones, and the platysma muscle 
which extends downwards into the neck close beneath the skin.  The upper facial muscles are responsible 
for the changing appearance of the eyebrows, forehead and the upper and lower lids of the eyes (Fig 1). 
The muscles conllact isotonically towards the static insertion into the cranium, consequently the surface 
tissue bunches and wrinkles perpendicularly to the direction of the muscle. Figure 3 The major muscles 
of the face. The muscles of the mouth have the most complex musclar interaction. The primary muscle 
being the Obicolaris Oris which is a sphincter muscle with no bony attachment. Additionally the deep 
Buccinator muscle fibres decussate into the upper and lower lip and continue round the face to the opposite 
point of attachment. Three primary muscles, M Levator, Labii Superioris and Alaeque Nasi, join from above. 
The deeper muscles M Buccinator joins at the modiolus (the major node of the mouth) and contracts horizontally. 
From below, the M Depressor, Anguli Oris, M Depressor Labii Inferioris and Mentalis, all contract obliquely 
and vertically. 5. Factors determining the modelling of muscles It is evident that the skin, being supported 
by bone and multiple layers of muscle, produces literally thousands of movement combinations. What is 
required is not the exact simulation of neurons, muscles and joints, but a model with a few dynamic parameters 
that emulate the primary characteristics. These parameters are relatively abstract, and do not attempt 
to model the biomechanical or neurophysiological mechanisms. Since the muscles themselves are grouped 
together to perform specific tasks, two. broad types of muscles are considered: linear/parallel muscles 
that pull and sphincter muscles that squeeze. Defining the surface skin as a mesh determines that each 
node has a finite degree of mobility (DOM). The primary factors determining the nodal mobility are: 
Tensile strength of the muscle and skin  Proximity to the muscle node of attachment  Depth of tissue 
at the node and the proximity to the bone  The elastic bounds of the relaxed tissue, and the interaction 
of other muscles.  The physical displacements of the facial nodes, especially around the mouth, have 
been measured by Summerfield [14] and his results indicate that displacements rarely exceed 25mm during 
the articulation of a/b/a sounds. Therefore assuming the node of bony attachment is static, a relationship 
for any intermediate node is required. The structural-based representation suggested by Badler [1] simulates 
points on the skin which is distorted around an ovoid. Arcs connect points with their neighbours, so 
that one skin movement affects the position of its neighbour in much the same way as a network of springs. 
When a force F is applied to a node p the change in location is computed by: p' = F/k where k = sum 
of the spring constants at that point. The iteration continues until a force is propagated out from the 
initiating point across the face. Badler's simulation is effective, but it does require specified facial 
models to operate upon, with tie points for the fixing of muscles to the bone and skin. This in turn 
requires information about length and elasticity to be determined before the iteration can begin. With 
all the muscle forms it is evident that they have a highly complex three-dimensional structure endowed 
with viscous, elastic and other mechanical properties that result in the displacement of the skin. The 
simulation of such interactions would be formidible, and is not the object of this paper, however some 
basic issues can be established. Only a proportion of the force is effective along the line of contraction, 
especially as the fibres become more oblique in relation to the node of attachment. This can be determined 
from the length of the muscle fibre x cosine of the angle of attachment of the muscle fibres to the tendon 
or surface tissue [18]. This gives a general indication of the displacement of the remaining tissue. 
The elasticity of the skin varies with age. Young skin has a higher elasticity than older flesh and this 
factor too should be accommodated in the muscle model. In addition to the static surface displacement 
features of the skin there are the motional characteristics. Here the requirement is to discern suitable 
motional criteria. Investigations by Kelso [14] into reiterant speech production outlined the dynamic 
properties during articulatory movement. For this process LED's were placed on the subject and monitored 
on an oscilloscope. Despite the inherent multi-dimensional process involved with speech, evidence showed 
that the system displayed near sinusoidal uniform motions, as if generated by a simple non-dissipative 
mass-spring system. This supports the early work of Parke [4] who produced convincing results utilizing 
the principle of cosine acceleration and deceleration. Subsequently this principal has been adopted as 
a first order approximation for this research, since the facial displacements are small and the rate 
at which the motions occur is extremely fast. 6. The Computer Model of muscles for the face The research 
presented in this paper represents the action of muscles using the primary motivators on a non-specific 
deformable topology of the face. The muscle actions themselves are tested against FACS which employs 
action units directly to one muscle or a small group of muscles. Any differences found between real action 
units and those performed on the computer model are easily corrected by changing the parameters for the 
muscles, until reasonable results were obtained. The muscle model was designed to be as 'naturalistic' 
as possible, in the representation. Two types of muscles were created: linear/parallel muscles that pull 
and sphincter muscles that squeeze. The key nodes of muscle attachment were measured on a number of faces, 
to establish the extremes of displacement and the maximum and minimum zone of influence. At best this 
proved to be difficult, as only the surface points could be measured, and the range of surface characteristics 
varies a great deal from face to face. However, it was confirmed that nodal displacements rarely exceed 
25mm, the largest displacements originating from the mouth groups. The zone of influence depended upon 
the degree of contraction and, using FACS as a basis, it was established that the angle varied from 15 
to 160 degrees, creating a convex zone. Additionally, using data from Summerfield [17], it was possible 
to establish degrees of freedom (DOF) for nodes around the mouth. SIGGRAPH '87, Anaheim, July 27-31 
1987 I~@~1 The fundamentals of most facial muscles determine that one end of a linear muscle has a bony 
attachment that remains static, while the other end is embedded in the soft tissue of the skin. When 
the muscle is operated, it contracts isotonically. Looking at the concept of muscle vectors, the zone 
of influence in the simplest form can be viewed as circular, and the fall-off is along the radius as 
illuslrated in Fig 4 on the three-dimensional grid. Muscle vectors can be described with direction and 
magnitude, both in two and three-dimensions. The direction is towards the point of attachment, and the 
magnitude that is zero at the point of attachment and increases to maximum at the other point of insertion 
into the skin. ,, ,;;; ...... , i i i | / i i i i i i i 1 i [ ~il| i i .ill Figure 4 A muscle vector 
displacing a three dimensional grid with a circular cosine falloff.  The next problem is to describe 
how the adjacent tissue, such as the node p (Fig 5) is affected by this muscle vector contraction. At 
the point of attachment to the skin we can assume maximum displacement, and at the point of bony attachment 
zero displacement. A fall-off of the displacement is dissipated through the adjoining tissue, both across 
the sector Pm,Pn and V1, Ps. Using a non-linear interpolant, it is possible to represent the simple action 
of a muscle such as in Fig 6. Fig 5 describes the muscle vector in two dimensions. By applying the same 
principles to the third dimension, point p (x,y,z) is displaced p' (x',y'~z'). RI P'-i /'"--. ;

II II Ill III Figure 9 Eliptical sphincter muscle The limits of a muscle action can be determined by 
the spring constant K, which represents the maximum displacement of the muscle. The problem associated 
with this model is that each muscle action is independent, and the actual nodal displacement is determined 
by a succession of muscle actions. This is more extreme when the contractions become isometric and nodes 
are shifted out of the zone of influence of adjoining muscle vectors. In this way there is a danger of 
exceeding the degree of freedom (DOF) of any node. The nodal structure of the face determines that each 
vertex has a finite DOF. By positioning the facial muscles, both feasible and impossible, and then preprocessing 
the structure, the DOF of each node can be determined. In this manner the order of the muscle contractions 
will not become isometric, as each node will store information about its common attractors (Fig 10).

The image synthesis and model operation Polygonal data structures have been shown to be an acceptable 
mode of modelling facial topologies [5][7], and were adopted in this research for ease of use. The nature 
of the muscle model described above allows a free range in polygonal construction. This has proved to 
be important in the modelling of real people's faces that require specific topologies for recognition 
purposes Fig 15. However it remains important to maintain a mesh that is as regular as possible, to avoid 
polygonal intersections and 'facet popping' when the model is articulated. This can be remedied by increasing 
the density of polygonal detail where the curvature is higher. Additionally, all the facets need to be 
triangulated to maintain planer polygons for the renderer. The heads shown Fig 15- 22 were modelled using 
photographic techniques [6] and mirrored about the meridian of the face. Although neither real faces 
nor the motional dynamics are symmetrical these are not problems as the muscles can operate independently 
on both sides of the face. For the simplicity of use, the faces illustrated were assumed to be symetrical 
in order to reduce the time-consuming effort of data duplication. The eyelids were constructed from the 
existing vertices of the face to create five curves, three for the upper lid and two for the lower. The 
upper lids rotate about a horizontal axis to close the eyelids. Swept revolutions of profdes created 
the eyeballs that have controls for the dilation of the pupil and the focusing of the eyes. Highlights 
were important in giving a realistic effect and this was achieved either by using the Phong renderer 
or by extracting facets and shading them white. The teeth were simply formed from sets of Bezier curves 
that were set back into the mouth cavity. The lower teeth are rotated with the jaw. The positioning of 
the muscles was achieved by identifying key nodes on the face [18] and relating them to the computer 
model in three-dimensional space for the location of the muscle vector head and tail. The model is implemented 
as a program that is parameter driven. The parameters are created in data files that control all the 
muscles, jaw rotations, eye focusing and the eyelids. The program generates polygonal or vector descriptions 
that can be rendered as desired. Ten muscles were implanted into the facial topology, representing those 
that are the required action units (AU) for FACS. Each linear muscle has parameters for:. Zone of influence

face on an alternative facial topology. Seven muscles (linear/parallel and sphincler muscles) were utilized 
with the jaw rotation to represent some of the actions from the Facial Action Coding System
