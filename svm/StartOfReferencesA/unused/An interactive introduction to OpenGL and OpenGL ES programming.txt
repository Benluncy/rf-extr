describe OpenGL s capabilities and features  Enable you to write an interactive, 3-D computer graphics 
program in OpenGL and OpenGL ES  Welcome This afternoon s Goals and Agenda Introduce programmable 
features through the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)  Introduce OpenGL ES for mobile devices  Introduce 
the advanced features of OpenGL that are key to the future of OpenGL   What Is OpenGL, and What Can 
It Do for Me? OpenGL and OpenGL ES are computer graphics rendering APIs  Generate high-quality color 
images by rendering with geometric and image primitives  Create interactive applications with 3D graphics 
 They are operating system independent  window system independent  For the time being, consider OpenGL 
ES to be the same as OpenGL  OpenGL is a library for doing computer graphics. By using it, you can 
create interactive applications that render high-quality color images composed of 3D geometric objects 
and images. OpenGL is window and operating system independent. As such, the part of your application 
which does rendering is platform independent. However, in order for OpenGL to be able to render, it needs 
a window to draw into. Generally, this is controlled by the windowing system on whatever platform you 
are working on. OpenGL ES, which is short for Embedded System (a not Subset as is commonly used), is 
mostly a subset of the OpenGL interface. As compared to current OpenGL (i.e. OpenGL 3.0), OpenGL ES doesn 
t contain all of the vesions of OpenGL within the same library. That is, OpenGL ES comes in two versions: 
1.1, and 2.0. OpenGL ES 1.1 is a fixed-function interface, much as you ll see described this morning. 
OpenGL ES 2.0, on the other hand, is a programmable interface (i.e., it uses shaders), which we ll describe 
in the afternoon of the course. Related APIs  GLU (OpenGL Utility Library)  part of OpenGL  NURBS, 
tessellators, quadric shapes, etc.   EGL, GLX, WGL, AGL/CGL/Cocoa glue between OpenGL and windowing 
systems  GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)  portable windowing API  not officially part of OpenGL   
 As mentioned, OpenGL is window and operating system independent. To integrate it into various window 
systems, additional libraries are used to modify a native window into an OpenGL capable window. Every 
window system has its own unique library and functions to do this. Some examples are: GLXfor the X Windows 
system, common on Unix platforms  Cocoaand AGLfor the Apple Macintosh  WGLfor Microsoft Windows OpenGL 
also includes a utility library, GLU, to simplify common tasks such as: rendering quadric surfaces (i.e., 
spheres, cones, cylinders, etc. ), working with NURBS and curves, and concave polygon tessellation. Finally 
to simplify programming and window system dependence, we will be using the freeware library, GLUT. GLUT, 
written by Mark Kilgard, is a public domain window system independent toolkit for making simple OpenGL 
applications. It simplifies the process of creating windows, working with events in the window system 
and handling animation. The above diagram illustrates the relationships of the various libraries and 
window system components. Generally, applications which require more user interface support will use 
a library designed to support those types of features (i.e., buttons, menu and scroll bars, etc.) such 
as Motif or the Win32 API. Prototype applications, or ones which do not require all the bells and whistles 
of a full GUI, may choose to use GLUT instead because of its simplified programming model and window 
system independence. OpenGL was primarily designed to be able to draw high-quality images fast enough 
so that an application could draw many of them a second, and provide the user with an interactive application, 
where each frame could be customized by input from the user. The general flow of an interactive application, 
including OpenGL applications is: 1. Configure and open a window suitable for drawing OpenGL into. 2. 
Initialize any OpenGL state that you will need to use throughout the application. 3. Process any events 
that the user might have entered. These could include pressing a key on the keyboard, moving the mouse, 
or even moving or resizing the application s window. 4. Draw your 3D image using OpenGL with values 
that may have been entered from the user s actions, or other data that the program has available to it. 
 An OpenGL Program #include <GL/glut.h> #include "cube.h" void main( int argc, char *argv[] ) { glutInit( 
&#38;argc, argv ); glutInitDisplayMode( GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DEPTH ); glutCreateWindow( argv[0] ); The main 
part of the program. init(); GLUT is used to glutDisplayFunc( display );open the OpenGL glutReshapeFunc( 
reshape ); window, and handle input from the user. glutMainLoop(); }  This slide contains the program 
statements for the main()routine of a C program that uses OpenGL and GLUT. For the most part, all of 
the programs you will see today, and indeed may of the programs available as examples of OpenGL programming 
that use GLUT will look very similar to this program. All GLUT-based OpenGL programs begin with configuring 
the GLUT window that gets opened. Next, in the routine init()(detailed on the following slide), global 
OpenGL state is configured. By global , we mean state that will be left on for the duration of the application. 
By setting that state once, we can make our OpenGL applications run as efficiently as possible. After 
initialization, we set up our GLUT callback functions, which are routines that you write to have OpenGL 
draw objects and other operations. Callback functions, if you re not familiar with them, make it easy 
to have a generic library (like GLUT), that can easily be configured by providing a few routines of your 
own construction. Finally, as with all interactive programs, the event loop is entered. For GLUT­based 
programs, this is done by calling glutMainLoop(). As glutMainLop()never exits (it is essentially an infinite 
loop), any program statements that follow glutMainLoop()will never be executed. First on this slide 
is the init()routine, which as mentioned, is where we set up the global OpenGL state. In this case, init()sets 
the color that the background of the window should be painted to when the window is cleared, as well 
as configuring where the eye should be located and enabling the depth test. Although you may not know 
what these mean at the moment, we will discuss each of those topics. What is important to notice is that 
what we set in init() remains in affect for the rest of the program s execution. There is nothing that 
says we can not turn these features off later; the separation of these routines in this manner is purely 
for clarity in the program s structure. The reshape() routine is called when the user of a program resizes 
the application s window. We do a number of things in this routine, all of which will be explained in 
detail in the Transformations section later today. An OpenGL Program (cont d.) void display( void ){ 
int i, j; glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ); glBegin( GL_QUADS ); for ( i = 0; i < 
NUM_CUBE_FACES; ++i ) { glColor3fv( faceColor[i] ); for ( j = 0; j < NUM_VERTICES_PER_FACE; ++j ) { 
glVertex3fv( vertex[face[i][j]] ); }  Have OpenGL }draw a cube glEnd(); from some 3D points glFlush(); 
} (vertices) Finally, we see the display()routine which is used by GLUT to call our OpenGL calls to 
make our image. Almost all of your OpenGL drawing code should be called from display()(or routines that 
display()calls). As with most display()-like functions, a number of common things occur in the following 
order: 1. The window is cleared with a call to glClear(). This will color all of the pixels in the window 
with the color set with glClearColor()(see the previous slide and look in the init()routine). Any image 
that was in the window is overwritten. 2. Next, we do all of our OpenGL rendering. In this case, we 
draw a cube, setting the color of each face with a call to glColor3fv(), and specify where the vertices 
of the cube should be positioned by calling glVertex3fv(). 3. Finally, when all of the OpenGL rendering 
is completed, we either call glFlush()or glutSwapBuffers()to swap the buffers, which will be discussed 
in the Animation and Depth Buffering section.  OpenGL Command Formats  components b -byte omit v for 
ub -unsigned byte 2 -(x,y) 3 -(x,y,z) 4 -(x,y,z,w) s -short us -unsigned short i -int scalar form glVertex2f( 
x, y ) ui -unsigned int f -float d -double x -fixed-point The OpenGL API calls are designed to accept 
almost any basic data type, which is reflected in the calls name. Knowing how the calls are structured 
makes it easy to determine which call should be used for a particular data format and size. For instance, 
vertices from most commercial models are stored as three component floating point vectors. As such, the 
appropriate OpenGL command to use is glVertex3fv( coords ). As mentioned before, OpenGL uses homogenous 
coordinates to specify vertices. For glVertex*() calls which do not specify all the coordinates ( i.e., 
glVertex2f()), OpenGL will default z = 0.0, and w = 1.0 . The fixed-point type is exclusive to OpenGL 
ES. Likewise, various types are exclusive to OpenGL, and not available in OpenGL ES. As we describe various 
functions, we ll use a small icon like this to describe which interfaces the function is compatible with. 
GLUT and GLU functions are exclusive to OpenGL, so we won t tag those functions with the icon. GL 3.0 
ES 1.1 ES 2.0  What s Required in Your Programs Headers Files #include <GL/gl.h> #include <GL/glu.h> 
#include <GL/glut.h>  Libraries  Enumerated Types  OpenGL defines numerous types for compatibility 
GLfloat, GLint, GLenum, etc. All of our discussions today will be presented in the C computer language. 
For C, there are a few required elements which an application must do: Header files describe all of 
the function calls, their parameters and defined constant values to the compiler. OpenGL has header files 
for GL (the core library), GLU (the utility library), and GLUT (freeware windowing toolkit). Note: glut.hincludes 
gl.hand glu.h. On Microsoft Windows, including only glut.his recommended to avoid warnings about redefining 
Windows macros.  Libraries are the operating system dependent implementation of OpenGL on the system 
you are using. Each operating system has its own set of libraries. For Unix systems, the OpenGL library 
is commonly named libGL.so(which is usually specified as -lGLon the compile line) and for Microsoft Windows, 
it is named opengl32.lib.  Finally, enumerated types are definitions for the basic types (i.e., float, 
double, int, etc.) which your program uses to store variables. To simplify platform independence for 
OpenGL programs, a complete set of enumerated types are defined. Use them to simplify transferring your 
programs to other operating systems.  GLUT Basics Application Structure: Configure and open window 
 Initialize OpenGL state  Register input callback functions  Enter event processing loop  Here is 
the basic structure that we will be using in our applications. This is generally what you would do in 
your own OpenGL applications. The steps are: 1. Choose the type of window that you need for your application 
and initialize it. 2. Initialize any OpenGL state that you do not need to change every frame of your 
program. This might include things like the background color, light positions and texture maps. 3. Register 
the callback functions that you will need. Callbacks are routines you write that GLUT calls when a certain 
sequence of events occurs, like the window needing to be refreshed, or the user moving the mouse. The 
most important callback function is the one to render your scene, which we will discuss in a few slides. 
 4. Enter the main event processing loop. This is where your application receives events, and schedules 
when callback functions are called.  GLUT Callback Functions  Routine to call when something happens 
 window resize or redraw  user input  animation   Register callbacks with GLUT  glutDisplayFunc( 
display ); glutIdleFunc( idle ); glutKeyboardFunc( keyboard ); GLUT uses a callback mechanism to do 
its event processing. Callbacks simplify event processing for the application developer. As compared 
to more traditional event driven programming, where the author must receive and process each event, and 
call whatever actions are necessary, callbacks simplify the process by defining what actions are supported, 
and automatically handling the user events. All the author must do is fill in what should happen when. 
GLUT supports many different callback actions, including: glutDisplayFunc()-called when pixels in the 
window need to be refreshed.  glutReshapeFunc()-called when the window changes size  glutKeyboardFunc()-called 
when a key is struck on the keyboard  glutMouseFunc()-called when the user presses a mouse button on 
the mouse  glutMotionFunc()-called when the user moves the mouse while a mouse button is pressed  glutPassiveMouseFunc()-called 
when the mouse is moved regardless of mouse button state  glutIdleFunc()-a callback function called 
when nothing else is going on. Very useful for animations.  What can OpenGL Draw?  Geometric primitives 
 points, lines and polygons  Image Primitives  images and bitmaps  separate pipeline for images and 
geometry  linked through texture mapping  Rendering depends on state  colors, materials, light sources, 
etc. As mentioned, OpenGL is a library for rendering computer graphics. Generally, there are two operations 
that you do with OpenGL: draw something change the state of how OpenGL draws OpenGL has two types of 
things that it can render: geometric primitives and image primitives. Geometric primitives are points, 
lines and polygons. Image primitives are bitmaps and graphics images (i.e., the pixels that you might 
extract from a JPEG image after you have read it into your program.) Additionally, OpenGL links image 
and geometric primitives together using texture mapping, which is an advanced topic we will discuss this 
afternoon. The other common operation that you do with OpenGL is setting state. Setting state is the 
process of initializing the internal data that OpenGL uses to render your primitives. It can be as simple 
as setting up the size of points and the color that you want a vertex to be, to initializing multiple 
mipmap levels for texture mapping. OpenGL Geometric Primitives All geometric primitives are specified 
by vertices G L _ P O I N T S   G L _ L I N E _ S T R I P G L _ L I N E _ L O O P G L _ P O L Y 
G O N G L _ L I N E S  G L _ T R I A N G L E S  G L _ T R I A N G L E _ F A N  G L _ Q U A D S G 
L _ Q U A D _ S T R I P G L _ T R I A N G L E _ S T R I P   Every OpenGL geometric primitive is specified 
by its vertices, which are homogenous coordinates. Homogenous coordinates are of the form ( x, y, z, 
w ). Depending on how vertices are organized, OpenGL can render any of the shown primitives. Specifying 
Geometric Primitives Primitives are specified using glBegin( primType ); glEnd(); GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0 
 primType determines how vertices are combined  glBegin( primType ); for ( i = 0; i <n; ++i ) {glColor3f( 
red[i], green[i], blue[i] ); glVertex3fv( coords[i] ); }glEnd(); OpenGL organizes vertices into primitives 
based upon which type is passed into glBegin(). The possible types are: GL_POINTS GL_LINE_STRIP GL_LINES 
GL_LINE_LOOP GL_POLYGON GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP GL_TRIANGLES GL_TRIANGLE_FAN GL_QUADS GL_QUAD_STRIP We also 
see an example of setting OpenGL s state, which is the topic of the next few slides, and most of the 
course. In this case, the color that our primitive is going to be drawn is set using the glColor()call. 
 Conceptually, OpenGL allows you, the application designer, to do two things: 1. Control how the next 
items you draw will be processed. This is done by setting the OpenGL s state. OpenGL s state includes 
the current drawing color, parameters that control the color and location of lights, texture maps, and 
many other configurable settings. 2. Draw, or using the technical term, render graphical objects called 
primitives.  Your application will consist of cycles of setting state, and rendering using the state 
that you just set. Controlling OpenGL s Drawing Set OpenGL s rendering state State controls how things 
are drawn shading lighting  texture maps line styles (stipples)  polygon patterns transparency 
  Most of programming OpenGL is controlling its internal configuration, called state. State is just 
the set of values that OpenGL uses when it draws something. For example, if you wanted to draw a blue 
triangle, you would first tell OpenGL to set the current vertex color to blue, using the glColor()function. 
Then you pass the geometry to draw the triangle using the glVertex()calls you just saw. OpenGL has over 
400 function calls in it, most of which are concerned with setting the rendering state. Among the things 
that state controls are: current rendering color  parameters used for simulating lighting  processing 
data to be used as texture maps  patterns (called stipples, in OpenGL) for lines and polygons  By 
only changing different parts of OpenGL s state, the same geometry (in the case of the image in the slide, 
a sphere) can be used to generate drastically different images. Going across the top row, the first sphere 
is merely a wire-frame rendering of the sphere. The middle image was made by drawing the sphere twice, 
once solid in black, and a second time as a white wire-frame sphere over the solid black one. The right-most 
image shows a flat-shaded sphere, under the influence of OpenGL lighting. Flat-shading means that each 
geometric primitive has the same color. For the bottom row, the first image is the same sphere, only 
this time, gouraud-(or smooth-) shaded. The only difference in the programs between the top-row right, 
and bottom-row left is a single line of OpenGL code. The middle sphere was generated using texture mapping. 
The final image is the smooth­shaded sphere, with texture-mapped lines over the solid sphere. Setting 
OpenGL State Three ways to set OpenGL state: 1. Set values to be used for processing vertices most common 
methods of setting state  glColor()/ glIndex()  glNormal()  glTexCoord()   state must be set before 
calling glVertex()  GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  The most common state setting operation is that of modifying 
attributes associated with vertices. While we ll discuss setting vertex colors, lighting normals, and 
texture coordinates, that s only a small part but the most common set of the state associated with vertices. 
These collection of calls are sometimes the immediate mode interface, in that as soon as the call executes, 
GL will do some processing. While variations of glNormal and glColor may be used in OpenGL ES 1.1, it 
s much better to use the vertex array interface that we ll describe later in the course for rendering 
geometry. As such, strictly speaking, the icon shown above isn Setting OpenGL State (cont d.) 2 . T u

i g u ri n g t h e s p e c i f i c s o f a p a rt i c u l a r r e n d e r i n g m o d e Each mode has 
unique commands for setting its values glMaterialfv() GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  There are two actions 
that are required to control how OpenGL renders. 1.The first is turning on or off a rendering feature. 
This is done using the OpenGL calls glEnable()and glDisable(). When glEnable()is called for a particular 
feature, all OpenGL rendering after that point in the program will use that feature until it is turned 
off with glDisable(). 2.Almost all OpenGL features have configurable values that you can set. Whether 
it is the color of the next thing you draw, or specifying an image that OpenGL should use as a texture 
map, there will be some calls unique to that feature that control all of its state. Most of the OpenGL 
API, and most of what you will see today, is concerned with setting the state of the individual features. 
Every OpenGL feature has a default set of values so that even without setting any state, you can still 
have OpenGL render things. The initial state is pretty boring; it renders most things in white. It s 
important to note that initial state is identical for every OpenGL implementation, regardless of which 
operating system, or which hardware system you are working on. While glEnable and glDisable are present 
in all of the OpenGL interfaces, each of them accepts a different set of the possible operations. OpenGL 
and Color  The OpenGL Color Model OpenGL uses the RGB color space There is also a color-index mode, 
but we do not discuss it  Colors are specified as floating-point numbers in the range [ 0.0, 1.0 ] 
 for example, to set a window s background color, you would call glClearColor( 1.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0 ); 
GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Since computer graphics are all about color, it is important to know how to specify 
colors when using OpenGL. Conceptually, OpenGL uses the RGB (red, green, and blue) color space. Each 
of the three colors is a component of the color. The value of each color component is a real (floating-point) 
number between 0.0 and 1.0. Values outside of that range are clamped. As an example, the call to set 
a window s background color in OpenGL is glClearColor(), as demonstrated on the slide. The colors specified 
for the background color are ( 1.0, 0.3, 0.6 ), for red, green, and blue, respectively. The fourth value 
in glClearColor()is named alpha and is discussed later in the course. Generally, when you call glClearColor(), 
you want to set the alpha component to 1.0. OpenGL also supports color-index mode rendering, but as RGB 
based rendering is the most common, and there are some features that require RGB (most notably, texture 
mapping), we do not discuss color-index mode rendering in the scope of this class. This is the first 
of the series of Nate Robins tutorials. This tutorial illustrates the principles of rendering geometry, 
specifying both colors and vertices. The shapes tutorial has two views: a screen-space window and a command 
manipulation window. In the command manipulation window, pressing the LEFT mouse while the pointer is 
over the green parameter numbers allows you to move the mouse in the y-direction (up and down) and change 
their values. With this action, you can change the appearance of the geometric primitive in the other 
window. With the RIGHT mouse button, you can bring up a pop-up menu to change the primitive you are rendering. 
(Note that the parameters have minimum and maximum values in the tutorials, sometimes to prevent you 
from wandering too far. In an application, you probably do not want to have floating-point color values 
less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, but you are likely to want to position vertices at coordinates outside 
the boundaries of this tutorial.) In the screen-space window, the RIGHT mouse button brings up a different 
pop-up menu, which has menu choices to change the appearance of the geometry in different ways. The left 
and right mouse buttons will do similar operations in the other tutorials.  Transformations  This 
model has become know as the synthetic camera model. Note that both the objects to be viewed and the 
camera are three-dimensional while the resulting image is two dimensional. Camera Analogy and Transformations 
 Projection transformations adjust the lens of the camera  Viewing transformations tripod define 
position and orientation of the viewing volume in the world  Modeling transformations moving the model 
 Viewport transformations  enlarge or reduce the physical photograph Note that human vision and a 
camera lens have cone-shaped viewing volumes. OpenGL (and almost all computer graphics APIs) describe 
a pyramid-shaped viewing volume. Therefore, the computer will see differently from the natural viewpoints, 
especially along the edges of viewing volumes. This is particularly pronounced for wide-angle fish-eye 
camera lenses. Coordinate Systems and Transformations Steps in forming an image 1. specify geometry 
(world coordinates) 2. specify camera (camera coordinates) 3. project (window coordinates) 4. map 
to viewport (screen coordinates)   Each step uses transformations  Every transformation is equivalent 
to a change in coordinate systems (frames)  Every transformation can be thought of as changing the 
representation of a vertex from one coordinate system or frame to another. Thus, initially vertices are 
specified in world or application coordinates. However, to view them, OpenGL must convert these representations 
to ones in the reference system of the camera. This change of representations is described by a transformation 
matrix (the model­view matrix). Similarly, the projection matrix converts from camera coordinates to 
window coordinates. Homogeneous Coordinates each vertex is a column vector . . x .... .... . v 
 . y z w w is usually 1.0  all operations are matrix multiplications  . directions (directed line 
segments) can be . represented with w = 0.0 A 3D vertex is represented by a 4-tuple vector (homogeneous 
coordinate system). Why is a 4-tuple vector used for a 3D (x, y, z) vertex? To ensure that all matrix 
operations are multiplications. If w is changed from 1.0, we can recover x, y and z by division by w. 
Generally, only perspective transformations change w and require this perspective division in the pipeline. 
3D Transformations A vertex is transformed by 4 x 4 matrices all affine operations are matrix multiplications

4th row and column, or operations would require addition, as well as multiplication. For operations other 
than perspective projection, the fourth row is always (0, 0, 0, 1) which leaves w unchanged.. Because 
OpenGL only multiplies a matrix on the right, the programmer must remember that the last matrix specified 
is the first applied. mm m m 04 812 mm m m 15 913 M . . .... .... . . .  Specifying Transformations 
 Programmer has two styles of specifying transformations specify matrices (glLoadMatrix, glMultMatrix) 
specify operation (glRotate, glOrtho)  Programmer does not have to remember the exact matrices  see 
appendix of the OpenGL Programming Guide Generally, a programmer can obtain the desired matrix by a 
sequence of simple transformations that can be concatenated together, e.g., glRotate(), glTranslate(), 
and glScale(). For the basic viewing transformations, OpenGL and the Utility library have supporting 
functions. Programming Transformations Prior to rendering, view, locate, and orient:  eye/camera position 
 3D geometry   Manage the matrices including matrix stack  Combine (composite) transformations 
 Because transformation matrices are part of the state, they must be defined prior to any vertices to 
which they are to apply. In modeling, we often have objects specified in their own coordinate systems 
and must use OpenGL transformations to bring the objects into the scene. OpenGL provides matrix stacks 
for each type of supported matrix (model-view, projection, texture) to store matrices. The depth of 
matrix stacks are implementation-dependent, but the Modelview matrix stack is guaranteed to be at least 
32 matrices deep, and the Projection matrix stack is guaranteed to be at least 2 matrices deep. The material-to-color, 
flat-shading, and clipping calculations take place after the Modelview matrix calculations, but before 
the Projection matrix. The polygon culling and rendering mode operations take place after the Viewport 
operations. There is also a texture matrix stack, which is outside the scope of this course. It is an 
advanced texture mapping topic. Matrix Operations Specify Current Matrix Stack glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW 
or GL_PROJECTION) Other Matrix or Stack Operations glLoadIdentity() glPushMatrix() glPopMatrix() GL 3.0 
ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Viewport usually same as window size  viewport aspect ratio should be same as projection 
transformation or resulting image may be distorted  glViewport( x, y, width, height ) GL 3.0 ES 1.1 
ES 2.0  glLoadMatrix*() replaces the matrix on the top of the current matrix stack. glMultMatrix*(), 
post-multiples the matrix on the top of the current matrix stack. The matrix argument is a column-major 
4 x 4 double or single precision floating point matrix. Matrix stacks are used because it is more efficient 
to save and restore matrices than to calculate and multiply new matrices. Popping a matrix stack can 
be said to jump back to a previous location or orientation. glViewport() clips the vertex or raster position. 
For geometric primitives, a new vertex may be created. For raster primitives, the raster position is 
completely clipped. There is a per-fragment operation, the scissor test, which works in situations where 
viewport clipping does not. The scissor operation is particularly good for fine clipping raster (bitmap 
or image) primitives. Projection Transformation  Shape of viewing frustum  Perspective projection 
 gluPerspective( fovy, aspect, zNear, zFar ) glFrustum( left, right, bottom, top, zNear, zFar ) Orthographic 
parallel projection glOrtho(left, right, bottom, top, zNear, zFar) gluOrtho2D( left, right, bottom, top 
) calls glOrtho with z values near zero GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  For perspective projections, the viewing 
volume is shaped like a truncated pyramid (frustum). There is a distinct camera (eye) position, and vertexes 
of objects are projected to camera. Objects which are further from the camera appear smaller. The default 
camera position at (0, 0, 0), looks down the z-axis, although the camera can be moved by other transformations. 
For gluPerspective(), fovy is the angle of field of view (in degrees) in the y direction. fovy must be 
between 0.0 and 180.0, exclusive. aspect is x/y and should be the same as the viewport to avoid distortion. 
zNear and zFar define the distance to the near and far clipping planes. The glFrustum()call is rarely 
used in practice. Warning: for gluPerspective()or glFrustum(), do not use zero for zNear! For glOrtho(), 
the viewing volume is shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped (a box). Vertices of an object are projected 
towards infinity, and as such, distance does not change the apparent size of an object, as happens under 
perspective projection. Orthographic projection is used for drafting, and design (such as blueprints). 
 Many users would follow the demonstrated sequence of commands with a glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)call 
to return to modelview stack. In this example, the red line segment is inside the view volume and is 
projected (with parallel projectors) to the green line on the view surface. The blue line segment lies 
outside the volume specified by glOrtho() and is clipped. Viewing Transformations  Position the camera/eye 
in the scene place the tripod down; aim camera  To fly through a scene tripod  change viewing transformation 
and redraw scene gluLookAt( eyex, eyey, eyez,aimx, aimy, aimz, upx, upy, upz ) up vector determines 
unique orientation  careful of degenerate positions   gluLookAt() multiplies itself onto the current 
matrix, so it usually comes after glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)and glLoadIdentity(). Because of degenerate 
positions, gluLookAt() is not recommended for most animated fly-over applications. An alternative is 
to specify a sequence of rotations and translations that are concatenated with an initial identity matrix. 
Note: that the name modelview matrix is appropriate since moving objects in the model front of the camera 
is equivalent to moving the camera to view a set of objects. The RIGHT mouse button controls different 
menus. The screen-space view menu allows you to choose different models. The command-manipulation menu 
allows you to select different projection commands (including glOrtho and glFrustum). Modeling Transformations 
 Move object glTranslate{fd}( x, y, z ) Rotate object around arbitrary axis .xyz. glRotate{fd}( angle, 
x, y, z ) angle is in degrees Dilate (stretch or shrink) or mirror object glScale{fd}( x,y, z ) GL 3.0 
ES 1.1 ES 2.0  glTranslate(), glRotate(), and glScale()multiplies itself onto the current matrix, so 
it usually comes after glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW). There are many situations where the modeling transformation 
is multiplied onto a non-identity matrix. A vertex s distance from the origin changes the effect of glRotate()or 
glScale(). These operations have a fixed point for the origin. Generally, the further from the origin, 
the more pronounced the effect. To rotate (or scale) with a different fixed point, we must first translate, 
then rotate (or scale) and then undo the translation with another translation. For right now, concentrate 
on changing the effect of one command at a time. After each time that you change one command, you may 
want to reset the values before continuing on to the next command. The RIGHT mouse button controls different 
menus. The screen-space view menu allows you to choose different models. The command-manipulation menu 
allows you to change the order of the glTranslatef() and glRotatef() commands. Later, we will see the 
effect of changing the order of modeling commands. Connection: Viewing and Modeling Moving camera is 
equivalent to moving every object in the world towards a stationary camera  Viewing transformations 
are equivalent to several modeling transformations  gluLookAt() has its own command  can make your 
own polar view or pilot view   Instead of gluLookAt(), one can use the following combinations of glTranslate() 
and glRotate() to achieve a viewing transformation. Like gluLookAt(), these transformations should be 
multiplied onto the ModelView matrix, which should have an initial identity matrix. To create a viewing 
transformation in which the viewer orbits an object, use this sequence (which is known as polar view 
): glTranslated(0, 0, -distance) glRotated(-twist, 0, 0, 1) glRotated(-incidence, 1, 0, 0) glRotated(azimuth, 
0, 0, 1) To create a viewing transformation which orients the viewer (roll, pitch, and heading) at position 
(x, y, z), use this sequence (known as pilot view ): glRotated(roll, 0, 0, 1) glRotated(pitch, 0, 1, 
0) glRotated(heading, 1, 0, 0) glTranslated(-x, -y, -z) Compositing Modeling Transformations Problem: 
hierarchical objects one position depends upon a previous position robot arm or hand; sub-assemblies 
 Solution: moving local coordinate system  modeling transformations move coordinate system  post-multiply 
column-major matrices  OpenGL post-multiplies matrices   The order in which modeling transformations 
are performed is important because each modeling transformation is represented by a matrix, and matrix 
multiplication is not commutative. So a rotate followed by a translate is different from a translate 
followed by a rotate. Compositing Modeling Transformations (cont d.) Problem: objects move relative 
to absolute world origin my object rotates around the wrong origin make it spin around its center or 
something else  Solution: fixed coordinate system  modeling transformations move objects around fixed 
coordinate system  pre-multiply column-major matrices  OpenGL post-multiplies matrices  must reverse 
order of operations to achieve desired effect   You will adjust to reading a lot of code backwards! 
Typical sequence glTranslatef(x,y,z); glRotatef(theta, ax, ay, az); glTranslatef(-x,-y,-z); object(); 
 Here (x, y, z) is the fixed point. We first (last transformation in code) move it to the origin. Then 
we rotate about the axis (ax, ay, az) and finally move fixed point back. Additional Clipping Planes 
At least 6 more clipping planes available  Good for cross-sections  Modelview matrix moves clipping 
plane  Ax . By . Cz . D . 0 clipped  glEnable( GL_CLIP_PLANEi ) glClipPlane( GL_CLIP_PLANEi, GLdouble* 
coeff ) GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Additional clipping planes, usually called user-clip planes, are very 
useful for cutting away part of a 3D model to allow a cross section view. The clipping planes you define 
using glClipPlane()are described using the equation of a plane, with the (A, B, C) coefficients describing 
the orientation (think of a plane normal), and D representing the distance from the origin. When you 
specify a clipping plane, the plane coefficients you provide are transformed by the current modelview 
matrix. This enables you to transform the plane using the standard modelview matrix stack operations, 
as compared to doing a bunch of vector math to transform the clipping plane itself.  Animation and 
Depth Buffering  Double buffer is a technique for tricking the eye into seeing smooth animation of rendered 
scenes. The color buffer is usually divided into two equal halves, called the front buffer and the back 
buffer. The front buffer is displayed while the application renders into the back buffer. When the application 
completes rendering to the back buffer, it requests the graphics display hardware to swap the roles of 
the buffers, causing the back buffer to now be displayed, and the previous front buffer to become the 
new back buffer. Animation Using Double Buffering 1. Request a double buffered color buffer glutInitDisplayMode( 
GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DOUBLE ); 2. Clear color buffer glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ); 3. Render scene 4. Request 
swap of front and back buffers  GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  glutSwapBuffers(); Repeat steps 2 -4 for animation 
Use a glutIdleFunc() callback Requesting double buffering in GLUT is simple. Adding GLUT_DOUBLEto your 
glutInitDisplayMode()call will cause your window to be double buffered. When your application is finished 
rendering its current frame, and wants to swap the front and back buffers, the glutSwapBuffers()call 
will request the windowing system to update the window s color buffers. Depth buffering is a technique 
to determine which primitives in your scene are occluded by other primitives. As each pixel in a primitive 
is rasterized, its distance from the eyepoint (depth value), is compared with the values stored in the 
depth buffer. If the pixel s depth value is less than the stored value, the pixel s depth value is written 
to the depth buffer, and its color is written to the color buffer. The depth buffer algorithm is: if 
( pixel->z < depthBuffer(x,y)->z ) { depthBuffer(x,y)->z = pixel->z; colorBuffer(x,y)->color = pixel->color; 
} OpenGL depth values range from [0.0, 1.0], with 1.0 being essentially infinitely far from the eyepoint. 
Generally, the depth buffer is cleared to 1.0 at the start of a frame. Enabling depth testing in OpenGL 
is very straightforward. A depth buffer must be requested for your window, once again using the glutInitDisplayMode(), 
and the GLUT_DEPTHbit. Once the window is created, the depth test is enabled using glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST 
).  Lighting Lighting Principles Lighting simulates how objects reflect light material composition 
of object  light s color and position  global lighting parameters  ambient light  two sided lighting 
  available in both color index  and RGBA mode  Lighting is an important technique in computer graphics. 
Without lighting, objects tend to look like they are made out of plastic. OpenGL divides lighting into 
three parts: material properties, light properties and global lighting parameters. Lighting is available 
in both RGBA mode and color index mode. RGBA is more flexible and less restrictive than color index mode 
lighting. OpenGL Shading OpenGL computes a color or shade for each vertex using a lighting model (the 
modified Phong model) that takes into account  Diffuse reflections  Specular reflections  Ambient 
light  Emission   Vertex shades are interpolated across polygons by the rasterizer  OpenGL can use 
the shade at one vertex to shade an entire polygon (constant shading) or interpolated the shades at the 
vertices across the polygon (smooth shading), the default. The Modified Phong Model  The model is a 
balance between simple computation and physical realism  The model uses  Light positions and intensities 
 Surface orientation (normals)  Material properties (reflectivity)  Viewer location   Computed for 
each source and each color component  The orientation of a surface is specified by the normal at each 
point. For a flat polygon the normal is constant over the polygon. Because normals are specified by the 
application program and can be changed between the specification of vertices, when we shade a polygon 
it can appear to be curved. How OpenGL Simulates Lights Phong lighting model Computed at vertices 
 Lighting contributors  Surface material properties  Light properties  Lighting model properties 
  OpenGL lighting is based on the Phong lighting model. At each vertex in the primitive, a color is 
computed using that primitives material properties along with the light settings. The color for the vertex 
is computed by adding four computed colors for the final vertex color. The four contributors to the vertex 
color are: Ambient is color of the object from all the undirected light in a scene.  Diffuse is the 
base color of the object under current lighting. There must be a light shining on the object to get a 
diffuse contribution.  Specular is the contribution of the shiny highlights on the object.  Emission 
is the contribution added in if the object emits light (i.e., glows)  Surface Normals Normals define 
how a surface reflects light glNormal3f( x, y, z ) Current normal is used to compute vertex s color 
 Use unit normals for proper lighting  scaling affects a normal s length GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  glEnable( 
GL_NORMALIZE ) or glEnable( GL_RESCALE_NORMAL )  The lighting normal tells OpenGL how the object reflects 
light around a vertex. If you imagine that there is a small mirror at the vertex, the lighting normal 
describes how the mirror is oriented, and consequently how light is reflected. glNormal*()sets the current 
normal, which is used in the lighting computation for all vertices until a new normal is provided. Lighting 
normals should be normalized to unit length for correct lighting results. glScale*()affects normals as 
well as vertices, which can change the normal s length, and cause it to no longer be normalized. OpenGL 
can automatically normalize normals, by enabling glEnable(GL_NORMALIZE). or glEnable(GL_RESCALE_NORMAL). 
GL_RESCALE_NORMALis a special mode for when your normals are uniformly scaled. If not, use GL_NORMALIZE 
which handles all normalization situations, but requires the computation of a square root, which can 
potentially lower performance OpenGL evaluators and NURBS can provide lighting normals for generated 
vertices automatically. Material Properties Define the surface properties of a primitive glMaterialfv( 
face, property, value ); GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  GL_DIFFUSE Base Color GL_SPECULAR Highlight Color GL_AMBIENT 
Low-light Color GL_EMISSION Glow Color GL_SHININESS Surface Smoothness separate materials for front 
and back Material properties describe the color and surface properties of a material (dull, shiny, etc.). 
OpenGL supports material properties for both the front and back of objects, as described by their vertex 
winding. The OpenGL material properties are: GL_DIFFUSE -base color of object  GL_SPECULAR-color of 
highlights on object  GL_AMBIENT-color of object when not directly illuminated  GL_EMISSION-color emitted 
from the object (think of a firefly)  GL_SHININESS-concentration of highlights on objects. Values range 
from 0 (very rough surface -no highlight) to 128 (very shiny)  Material properties can be set for each 
face separately by specifying either GL_FRONTor GL_BACK, or for both faces simultaneously using GL_FRONT_AND_BACK. 
Light Sources glLightfv( light, property, value ); lightspecifies which light multiple lights, starting 
with GL_LIGHT0 glGetIntegerv( GL_MAX_LIGHTS, &#38;n ); properties colors  position and type  attenuation 
 GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  The glLight()call is used to set the parameters for a light. OpenGL implementations 
must support at least eight lights, which are named GL_LIGHT0 through GL_LIGHTn, where n is one less 
than the maximum number supported by an implementation. OpenGL lights have a number of characteristics 
which can be changed from their default values. Color properties allow separate interactions with the 
different material properties. Position properties control the location and type of the light and attenuation 
controls the natural tendency of light to decay over distance. OpenGL lights can emit different colors 
for each of a materials properties. For example, a light s GL_AMBIENTcolor is combined with a material 
s GL_AMBIENT color to produce the ambient contribution to the color -Likewise for the diffuse and specular 
colors. Types of Lights OpenGL supports two types of Lights  Local (Point) light sources  Infinite 
(Directional) light sources   Type of light controlled by w coordinate  . xyz . .  0 Infinite 
Light directed along w . w. y x z .  0 Local Light positioned at w ww OpenGL supports two types 
of lights: infinite (directional) and local (point) light sources. The type of light is determined by 
the w coordinate of the light s position. . xyz . . 0 . . .define infinite light .at an .. x 0 
define a local light at A light s position is transformed by the current ModelView matrix when it is 
w if  y z www w specified. As such, you can achieve different effects by when you specify the position. 
Turning on the Lights Flip each light s switch glEnable( GL_LIGHTn ); Turn on the power glEnable( GL_LIGHTING 
); GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Each OpenGL light is controllable separately, using glEnable()and the respective 
light constant GL_LIGHTn. Additionally, global control over whether lighting will be used to compute 
primitive colors is controlled by passing GL_LIGHTINGto glEnable().This provides a handy way to enable 
and disable lighting without turning on or off all of the separate components. In this tutorial, concentrate 
on noticing the affects of different material and light properties. Additionally, compare the results 
of using a local light versus using an infinite light. In particular, experiment with the GL_SHININESSparameter 
to see its affects on highlights. Controlling a Light s Position Modelview matrix affects a light s position 
 Different effects based on when position is specified  eye coordinates  world coordinates  model 
coordinates   Push and pop matrices to uniquely control a light s position  As mentioned previously, 
a light s position is transformed by the current ModelView matrix when it is specified. As such, depending 
on when you specify the light s position, and what values are in the ModelView matrix, you can obtain 
different lighting effects. In general, there are three coordinate systems where you can specify a light 
s position/direction 1) Eye coordinates -which is represented by an identity matrix in the ModelView. 
In this case, when the light s position/direction is specified, it remains fixed to the imaging plane. 
As such, regardless of how the objects are manipulated, the highlights remain in the same location relative 
to the eye. 2) World Coordinates -when only the viewing transformation is in the ModelView matrix. In 
this case, a light s position/direction appears fixed in the scene, as if the light were on a lamppost. 
3) Model Coordinates -any combination of viewing and modeling transformations is in the ModelView matrix. 
This method allows arbitrary, and even animated, position of a light using modeling transformations. 
 This tutorial demonstrates the different lighting affects of specifying a light s position in eye and 
world coordinates. Experiment with how highlights and illuminated areas change under the different lighting 
position specifications. Tips for Better Lighting Recall lighting computed only at vertices model tessellation 
heavily affects lighting results better results but more geometry to process  Use a single infinite 
light for fastest lighting  minimal computation per vertex As with all of computing, time versus space 
is the continual tradeoff. To get the best results from OpenGL lighting, your models should be finely 
tessellated to get the best specular highlights and diffuse color boundaries. This yields better results, 
but usually at a cost of more geometric primitives, which could slow application performance. To achieve 
maximum performance for lighting in your applications, use a single infinite light source. This minimizes 
the amount of work that OpenGL has to do to light every vertex. Note that with programmable shaders (see 
advanced topics) we can do lighting calculations for each pixel.  Imaging and Raster Primitives Pixel-based 
primitives  Bitmaps 2D array of bit masks for pixels update pixel color based on current color  Images 
 2D array of pixel color information complete color information for each pixel  OpenGL does not understand 
image formats  In addition to geometric primitives, OpenGL also supports pixel-based primitives. These 
primitives contain explicit color information for each pixel that they contain. They come in two types: 
Bitmaps are single bit images, which are used as a mask to determine which pixels to update. The current 
color, set with glColor()is used to determine the new pixel color. Images are blocks of pixels with complete 
color information for each pixel. OpenGL, however, does not understand image formats, like JPEG, PNG 
or GIFs. In order for OpenGL to use the information contained in those file formats, the file must be 
read and decoded to obtain the color information, at which point, OpenGL can rasterize the color values. 
Pixel Pipeline Programmable pixel storage and transfer operations glBitmap(), glDrawPixels() CPU Pixel 
Storage Modes  Pixel-Transfer Rasterization Per Fragment (including Operations Operations (and Pixel 
Map) Pixel Zoom)  Texture glCopyTex*Image(); Memory glReadPixels(), glCopyPixels() Frame Buffer  Just 
as there is a pipeline that geometric primitives go through when they are processed, so do pixels. The 
pixels are read from main storage, processed to obtain the internal format which OpenGL uses, which may 
include color translations or byte-swapping. After this, each pixel is rasterized into the framebuffer. 
In addition to rendering into the framebuffer, pixels can be copied from the framebuffer back into host 
memory, or transferred into texture mapping memory. For best performance, the internal representation 
of a pixel array should match the hardware. For example, with a 24 bit frame buffer, 8-8-8 RGB would 
probably be a good match, but 10-10-10 RGB could be bad. Warning: non-default values for pixel storage 
and transfer can be very slow. Positioning Image Primitives glRasterPos3f( x, y, z ) glWindosPos3f( 
x, y, z ) raster position transformed like geometry  discarded if raster position is outside of viewport 
 may need to fine tune viewport for desired results GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Raster Position Images 
are positioned by specifying the raster position, which maps the lower left corner of an image primitive 
to a point in space. Raster positions are transformed and clipped the same as vertices. If a raster position 
fails the clip check, no fragments are rasterized. Rendering Images glDrawPixels( width, height, format, 
type, pixels ) GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  render pixels with lower left of image at current raster position 
 numerous formats and data types for specifying storage in memory  best performance by using format 
and type that matches hardware Rendering images is done with the glDrawPixels()command. A block of pixels 
from host CPU memory is passed into OpenGL with a format and data type specified. For each pixel in the 
image, a fragment is generated using the color retrieved from the image, and further processed. OpenGL 
supports many different formats for images including: RGB images with an RGB triplet for every pixel 
 intensity images which contain only intensity for each pixel. These images are converted into greyscale 
RGB images internally.  depth images which are depth values written to the depth buffer, as compared 
to the color framebuffer. This is useful in loading the depth buffer with values and then rendering a 
matching color images with depth testing enabled.  stencil images which copy stencil masks in the stencil 
buffer. This provides an easy way to load a complicated per pixel mask.  The type of the image describes 
the format that the pixels stored in host memory. This could be primitive types like GL_FLOAT or GL_INT, 
or pixels with all color components packed into a primitive type, like GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5. Reading 
Pixels glReadPixels( x, y, width, height, format, type, pixels ) read pixels from specified (x, y) 
position in framebuffer  pixels automatically converted from framebuffer format into requested format 
and type  Framebuffer pixel copy glCopyPixels( x, y, width, height, type ) GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  GL 
3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Just as you can send pixels to the framebuffer, you can read the pixel values back 
from the framebuffer to host memory for doing storage or image processing. Pixels read from the framebuffer 
are processed by the pixel storage and transfer modes, as well as converting them into the format and 
type requested, and placing them in host memory. Additionally, pixels can be copied from the framebuffer 
from one location to another using glCopyPixels(). Pixels are processed by the pixel storage and transfer 
modes before being returned to the framebuffer.  Textures are images that can be thought of as continuous 
and be one, two, three, or four dimensional. By convention, the coordinates of the image are s, t, r 
and q. Thus for the two dimensional image above, a point in the image is given by its (s, t) values with 
(0, 0) in the lower-left corner and (1, 1) in the top-right corner. A texture map for a two-dimensional 
geometric object in (x, y, z) world coordinates maps a point in (s, t) space to a corresponding point 
on the screen. The advantage of texture mapping is that visual detail is in the image, not in the geometry. 
Thus, the complexity of an image does not affect the geometric pipeline (transformations, clipping) in 
OpenGL. Texture is added during rasterization where the geometric and pixel pipelines meet. Texture Example 
On the bottom-right is a 256 × 256 image that has been mapped to a rectangular polygon which is viewed 
in perspective at the top.  This example is from the texture mapping tutorial demo. The size of textures 
must be a power of two. However, we can use image manipulation routines to convert an image to the required 
size. Texture can replace lighting and material effects or be used in combination with them. Applying 
Textures I Three steps to applying a texture 1. specify the texture read or generate image  assign 
to texture  enable texturing  2. assign texture coordinates to vertices 3. specify texture parameters 
 wrapping, filtering In the simplest approach, we must perform these three steps. Textures reside in 
texture memory. When we assign an image to a texture it is copied from processor memory to texture memory 
where pixels are formatted differently. Texture coordinates are actually part of the state as are other 
vertex attributes such as color and normals. As with colors, OpenGL interpolates texture inside geometric 
objects. Because textures are really discrete and of limited extent, texture mapping is subject to aliasing 
errors that can be controlled through filtering. Texture memory is a limited resource and having only 
a single active texture can lead to inefficient code. Texture Objects  Have OpenGL store your images 
 one image per texture object may be shared by several graphics contexts  Generate texture names  
glGenTextures( n, *texIds ); GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  The first step in creating texture objects is to 
have OpenGL reserve some indices for your objects. glGenTextures()will request n texture ids and return 
those values back to you in texIds. To begin defining a texture object, you call glBindTexture()with 
the id of the object you want to create. The target is one of GL_TEXTURE_{123}D(). All texturing calls 
become part of the object until the next glBindTexture()is called. To have OpenGL use a particular texture 
object, call glBindTexture()with the target and id of the object you want to be active. To delete texture 
objects, use glDeleteTextures( n, *texIds ), where texIds is an array of texture object identifiers to 
be deleted. Texture Objects (cont'd.) Create texture objects with texture data and state glBindTexture( 
target, id ); Bind textures before using glBindTexture( target, id ); GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Specifying 
a Texture Image Define a texture image from an array of texels in CPU memory glTexImage2D( target, level, 
components, w, h, border, format, type, *texels ); dimensions of image must be powers of 2 Texel colors 
are processed by pixel pipeline pixel scales, biases and lookups can be done GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  
Specifying the texels for a texture is done using the glTexImage{123}D() call. This will transfer the 
texels in CPU memory to OpenGL, where they will be processed and converted into an internal format. The 
array of texels sent to OpenGL with glTexImage*()must be a power of two in both directions. An optional 
one texel wide border may be added around the image. This is useful for certain wrapping modes. The level 
parameter is used for defining how OpenGL should use this image when mapping texels to pixels. Generally, 
you ll set the level to 0, unless you are using a texturing technique called mipmapping, which we will 
discuss in the next section. OpenGL ES either version only support 2D texutre maps (without considering 
extensions). Converting a Texture Image If dimensions of image are not power of 2 gluScaleImage( format, 
w_in, h_in, type_in, *data_in, w_out, h_out, type_out, *data_out ); *_in is for source image *_out is 
for destination image Image interpolated and filtered during scaling If your image does not meet the 
power of two requirement for a dimension, the gluScaleImage()call will resample an image to a particular 
size. It uses a simple box filter to interpolate the new images pixels from the source image. Additionally, 
gluScaleImage()can be used to convert from one data type ( i.e., GL_FLOAT ) to another type, which may 
better match the internal format in which OpenGL stores your texture. Note that use of gluScaleImage() 
can also save memory. Mapping a Texture  Based on parametric texture coordinates  glTexCoord*() specified 
at each vertex  GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Texture Space Object Space t 1, 1 (s, t) = (0.2, 0.8) 0, 1 A 
  C (0.8, 0.4) 0,0 1,0 s When you want to map a texture onto a geometric primitive, you need to provide 
texture coordinates. The glTexCoord*()call sets the current texture coordinates. Valid texture coordinates 
are between 0 and 1, for each texture dimension, and the default texture coordinate is ( 0, 0, 0, 1 ). 
If you pass fewer texture coordinates than the currently active texture mode ( for example, using glTexCoord1d() 
while GL_TEXTURE_2D is enabled ), the additionally required texture coordinates take on default values. 
While OpenGL ES 1.1 includes support for immediate-mode texture coordinate specification, it doesn t 
accept the glTexCoord, but rather the multi-texture routine glMultiTexCoord. As we re only introducing 
the concept of texture mapping here, we only describe operations using a single texture. However, all 
versions of OpenGL and OpenGL ES support mulit-texturing where you can apply more than one texture to 
a geometric primitive in a single pass. Generating Texture Coordinates Automatically generate texture

coordinates based upon distance from plane  generation modes  GL_OBJECT_LINEAR  GL_EYE_LINEAR  GL_SPHERE_MAP 
   You can have OpenGL automatically generate texture coordinates for vertices by using the glTexGen()and 
glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_GEN_{STRQ}). The coordinates are computed by determining the vertex s distance from 
each of the enabled generation planes. As with lighting positions, texture generation planes are transformed 
by the ModelView matrix, which allows different results based upon when the glTexGen()is issued. There 
are three ways in which texture coordinates are generated: GL_OBJECT_LINEAR -textures are fixed to the 
object (like wallpaper) GL_EYE_LINEAR -texture fixed in space, and object move through texture ( like 
underwater light shining on a swimming fish) GL_SPHERE_MAP-object reflects environment, as if it were 
made of mirrors (like the shiny guy in Terminator 2)  Applying Textures II  specify textures in texture

can also be generated The general steps to enable texturing are listed above. Some steps are optional, 
and due to the number of combinations, complete coverage of the topic is outside the scope of this course. 
Here we use the texture object approach. Using texture objects may enable your OpenGL implementation 
to make some optimizations behind the scenes. As with any other OpenGL state, texture mapping requires 
that glEnable() be called. The tokens for texturing are: GL_TEXTURE_1D-one dimensional texturing GL_TEXTURE_2D-two 
dimensional texturing GL_TEXTURE_3D-three dimensional texturing 2D texturing is the most commonly used. 
1D texturing is useful for applying contours to objects ( like altitude contours to mountains ). 3D texturing 
is useful for volume rendering. Texture Application Methods  Filter Modes  minification or magnification 
 special mipmap minification filters   Wrap Modes clamping or repeating  Texture Functions  how 
to mix primitive s color with texture s color blend, modulate or replace texels Textures and the objects 
being textured are rarely the same size ( in pixels ). Filter modes determine the methods used by how 
texels should be expanded ( magnification ), or shrunk ( minification ) to match a pixel s size. An additional 
technique, called mipmapping is a special instance of a minification filter. Wrap modes determine how 
to process texture coordinates outside of the [0,1] range. The available modes are: GL_CLAMP -clamp any 
values outside the range to closest valid value, causing the edges of the texture to be smeared across 
the primitive GL_REPEAT-use only the fractional part of the texture coordinate, causing the texture to 
repeat across an object Finally, the texture environment describes how a primitives fragment colors 
and texel colors should be combined to produce the final framebuffer color. Depending upon the type of 
texture ( i.e., intensity texture vs. RGBA texture ) and the mode, pixels and texels may be simply multiplied, 
linearly combined, or the texel may replace the fragment s color altogether. Filter modes control how 
pixels are minified or magnified. Generally a color is computed using the nearest texel or by a linear 
average of several texels. The filter type, above is one of GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER or GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER. 
The mode is one of GL_NEAREST, GL_LINEAR, or special modes for mipmapping. Mipmapping modes are used 
for minification only, and can have values of: GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST 
GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR Full coverage of mipmap texture filters is outside the scope of this course. 
Mipmapped Textures  Mipmap allows for prefiltered texture maps of decreasing resolutions  Lessens interpolation 
errors for smaller textured objects  Declare mipmap level during texture definition  glTexImage*D( 
GL_TEXTURE_*D, level, ) GLU mipmap builder routines gluBuild*DMipmaps( ) OpenGL 1.2 introduces advanced 
LOD controls As primitives become smaller in screen space, a texture may appear to shimmer as the minification 
filters creates rougher approximations. Mipmapping is an attempt to reduce the shimmer effect by creating 
several approximations of the original image at lower resolutions. Each mipmap level should have an image 
which is one-half the height and width of the previous level, to a minimum of one texel in either dimension. 
For example, level 0 could be 32 x 8 texels. Then level 1 would be 16 x 4; level 2 would be 8 x 2; level 
3, 4 x 1; level 4, 2 x 1, and finally, level 5, 1 x 1. The gluBuild*Dmipmaps() routines will automatically 
generate each mipmap image, and call glTexImage*D() with the appropriate level value. OpenGL 1.2 introduces 
control over the minimum and maximum mipmap levels, so you do not have to specify every mipmap level 
(and also add more levels, on the fly). Wrap mode determines what should happen if a texture coordinate 
lies outside of the [0,1] range. If the GL_REPEAT wrap mode is used, for texture coordinate values less 
than zero or greater than one, the integer is ignored and only the fractional value is used. If the GL_CLAMP 
wrap mode is used, the texture value at the extreme (either 0 or 1) is used. Texture Functions Controls 
how texture is applied glTexEnv{fi}[v]( GL_TEXTURE_ENV, prop, param ) GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE modes GL_MODULATE 
 GL_BLEND  GL_REPLACE  Set blend color with GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR The texture mode determines how 
texels and fragment colors are combined. The most common modes are: GL_MODULATE -multiply texel and fragment 
color GL_BLEND -linearly blend texel, fragment, env color GL_REPLACE -replace fragment s color with texel 
If prop is GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR, param is an array of four floating point values representing the color 
to be used with the GL_BLEND texture function. A d v a n c e d O p e n G L To p ic s Immediate Mode

share display lists among graphics contexts in the X Window System, use the glXCreateContext() routine. 
 In immediate mode, primitives (vertices, pixels) flow through the system and produce images. These data 
are lost. New images are created by reexecuting the display function and regenerating the primitives. 
In retained mode, the primitives are stored in a display list (in compiled form). Images can be recreated 
by executing the display list. Even without a network between the server and client, display lists should 
be more efficient than repeated executions of the display function. Display Lists Creating a display

routines */glEndList(); } Call a created list void display( void ) { glCallList( id ); } GL 3.0 ES 1.1 
ES 2.0  Instead of GL_COMPILE, glNewList also accepts the constant GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE, which both 
creates and executes a display list. If a new list is created with the same identifying number as an 
existing display list, the old list is replaced with the new calls. No error occurs. Display Lists (cont 
d.) Not all OpenGL routines can be stored in display lists  State changes persist, even after a display 
list is finished  Display lists can call other display lists  Display lists are not editable, but you 
can fake it  make a list (A) which calls other lists (B, C, and D)  delete and replace B, C, and D, 
as needed   Some routines cannot be stored in a display list. Here are some of them: all glGet* routines

glSelectBuffer glRenderMode glVertexPointer glNormalPointer glColorPointer glIndexPointer glReadPixels 
glPixelStore glGenTextures glTexCoordPointer glEdgeFlagPointer glEnableClientState glDisableClientState 
glDeleteTextures glAreTexturesResident glFlush glFinish If there is an attempt to store any of these 
routines in a display list, the routine is executed in immediate mode. No error occurs. Display Lists

 basis for GLU NURBS NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)  GLU Quadric Objects  sphere  cylinder 
(or cone)  disk (circle)   In addition to specifying vertices one at a time using glVertex*(), OpenGL 
supports the use of arrays, which allows you to pass an array of vertices, lighting normals, colors, 
edge flags, or texture coordinates. This is very useful for systems where function calls are computationally 
expensive. Additionally, the OpenGL implementation may be able to optimize the processing of arrays. 
OpenGL evaluators, which automate the evaluation of the Bernstein polynomials, allow curves and surfaces 
to be expressed algebraically. They are the underlying implementation of the OpenGL Utility Library s 
NURBS implementation. Finally, the OpenGL Utility Library also has calls for generating polygonal representation 
of quadric objects. The calls can also generate lighting normals and texture coordinates for the quadric 
objects. Alpha: the 4th Color Component Measure of Opacity simulate translucent objects glass, water, 
etc.  composite images  antialiasing  ignored if blending is not enabled  glEnable( GL_BLEND ) GL 
3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  The alpha component for a color is a measure of the fragment s opacity. As with 
other OpenGL color components, its value ranges from 0.0 (which represents completely transparent) to 
1.0 (completely opaque). Alpha values are important for a number of uses: simulating translucent objects 
like glass, water, etc.  blending and compositing images  antialiasing geometric primitives Blending 
can be enabled using glEnable(GL_BLEND).  Blending combines fragments with pixels to produce a new pixel 
color. If a fragment makes it to the blending stage, the pixel is read from the framebuffer s position, 
combined with the fragment s color and then written back to the position. The fragment and pixel each 
have a factor which controls their contribution to the final pixel color. These blending factors are 
set using glBlendFunc(), which sets the source factor, which is used to scale the incoming fragment color, 
and the destination blending factor, which scales the pixel read from the framebuffer. Common OpenGL 
blending factors are: GL_ONE GL_ZERO GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA They are then combined using 
the blending equation, which is addition by default. Blending is enabled using glEnable(GL_BLEND) Note: 
If your OpenGL implementation supports the GL_ARB_imaging extension, you can modify the blending equation 
as well. Fog glFog{if}( property, value ) Depth Cueing Specify a range for a linear fog ramp GL_FOG_LINEAR 
 Environmental effects  Simulate more realistic fog GL_FOG_EXP  GL_FOG_EXP2  GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0 
  Fog works in two modes: Linear fog mode is used for depth cueing affects. In this mode, you provide 
OpenGL with a starting and ending distance from the eye, and between those distances, the fog color is 
blended into the primitive in a linear manner based on distance from the eye. In this mode, the fog coefficient 
is computed as z . start f . end . start Here s a code snippet for setting up linear fog: glFogf(GL_FOG_MODE, 
GL_FOG_LINEAR); glFogf(GL_FOG_START, fogStart); glFogf(GL_FOG_END, fogEnd); glFogfv(GL_FOG_COLOR, fogColor); 
glEnable(GL_FOG); Exponential fog mode is used for more natural environmental affects like fog, smog 
and smoke. In this mode, the fog s density increases exponentially with the distance from the eye. For 
these modes, the coefficient is computed as .density .z . f .. .e GL_FOG_EXP .density .z2 .e GL_FOG_EXP2 
. In this tutorial, experiment with the different fog modes, and in particular, the parameters which 
control either the fog density (for exponential mode) and the start and end distances (for linear mode). 
Multi-pass Rendering Blending allows results from multiple drawing passes to be combined together enables 
more complex rendering algorithms Example of bump-mapping done with a multi-pass OpenGL algorithm OpenGL 
blending enables techniques which may require accumulating multiple images of the same geometry with 
different rendering parameters to be done. Antialiasing Removing the Jaggies  glEnable( mode )  GL_POINT_SMOOTH 
 GL_LINE_SMOOTH  GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH  alpha value computed by computing sub-pixel coverage  available 
in both RGBA and colormap modes   GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0   Antialiasing is a process to remove the 
jaggies which is the common name for jagged edges of rasterized geometric primitives. OpenGL supports 
antialiasing of all geometric primitives by enabling both GL_BLEND and one of the constants listed above. 
Antialiasing is accomplished in RGBA mode by computing an alpha value for each pixel that the primitive 
touches. This value is computed by subdividing the pixel into subpixels and determining the ratio used 
subpixels to total subpixels for that pixel. Using the computed alpha value, the fragment s colors are 
blended into the existing color in the framebuffer for that pixel. Color index mode requires a ramp of 
colors in the colormap to simulate the different values for each of the pixel coverage ratios. In certain 
cases, GL_POLYGON_SMOOTHmay not provide sufficient results, particularly if polygons share edges. As 
such, using the accumulation buffer for full scene antialising may be a better solution. Accumulation 
Buffer Problems of compositing into color buffers limited color resolution  clamping  loss of accuracy 
  Accumulation buffer acts as a floating point color buffer  accumulate into accumulation buffer 
 transfer results to frame buffer   Since most graphics hardware represents colors in the framebuffer 
as integer numbers, we can run into problems if we want to accumulate multiple images together. Suppose 
the framebuffer has 8 bits per color component. If we want to prevent any possible overflow adding 256 
8 bit per color images, we would have to divide each color component by 256 thus reducing us to 0 bits 
of resolution. Many OpenGL implementations support the accumulation in software only, and as such, using 
the accumulation buffer may cause some slowness in rendering. High end graphics cards now use floating 
point frame buffers which allow us to do many of the operations such as compositing without and faster 
without loss of accuracy directly in the frame buffer and without use of an accumulation buffer. Compositing, 
which combines several images into a single image, done with the accumulation buffer generally gives 
better results than blending multiple passes into the framebuffer. Full scene antialiasing utilizes compositing 
in the accumulation buffer to smooth the jagged edges of all objects in the scene. Depth of field, simulates 
how a camera lens can focus on a single object while other objects in the view may be out of focus. Filtering 
techniques, such as convolutions and blurs (from image processing) can be done easily in the accumulation 
buffer by rendering the same image multiple times with slight pixel offsets. Motion blur, a technique 
often used in Saturday morning cartoons, simulates motion in a stationary object. We can do with the 
accumulation buffer by rendering the same scene multiple times, and varying the position of the object 
we want to appear as moving for each render pass. Compositing the results will give the impression of 
the object moving. Stencil Buffer Used to control drawing based on values in the stencil buffer Fragments 
that fail the stencil test are not drawn  Example: create a mask in stencil buffer and draw only objects 
not in mask area  Unlike other buffers, we do not draw into the stencil buffer. We set its values with 
the stencil functions. However, the rendering can alter the values in the stencil buffer depending on 
whether a fragment passes or fails the stencil test. In order for a fragment to make it to the frame 
buffer, it has a number of testing stages and pixel combination modes to go through. The tests that a 
fragment must pass are: scissor test -an additional clipping test  alpha test -a filtering test based 
on the alpha color component  stencil test -a pixel mask test  depth test -fragment occlusion test 
Each of these tests is controlled by a glEnable()capability. If a fragment passes all enabled tests, 
it is then blended, dithered and/or logically combined with pixels in the framebuffer. Each of these 
operations can be enabled and disabled. Alpha Test Reject pixels based on their alpha value glAlphaFunc( 
func, value ) glEnable( GL_ALPHA_TEST ) use alpha as a mask in textures GL 3.0 ES 1.1 ES 2.0  Alpha 
values can also be used for fragment testing. glAlphaFunc()sets a value which, if glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST)has 
been called, will test every fragment s alpha against the value set, and if the test fails, the fragment 
is discarded. The functions which glAlphaFunc() can use are: GL_NEVER GL_LESS GL_EQUAL GL_LEQUAL GL_GREATER 
GL_NOTEQUAL GL_GEUQAL GL_ALWAYS The default is GL_ALWAYS, which always passes fragments. Alpha testing 
is particularly useful when combined with texture mapping with textures which have an alpha component. 
This allows your texture map to act as a localized pixel mask. This technique is commonly used for objects 
like trees or fences, where modeling the objects (and all of its holes) becomes prohibitive. Vertex

graphical processing units (GPUs) have become more powerful and now are programmable  Support first 
through OpenGL extensions and OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)  Incorporated in OpenGL 2.0  By most 
measures, GPUs are more powerful than the CPUs in workstations. However, the architecture of a GPU is 
that of a stream processor. GPUs can also be programmed using Nvidia s Cg (C for Graphics) language which 
is almost identical to Microsoft s High Level Shading Language (HLSL). Hence shaders written in Cg will 
run under both OpenGL and DirectX on Windows platforms. Cg and GLSL are very similar. However, the advantage 
of GLSL is that, like the rest of OpenGL, it is platform independent. In addition, because GLSL is tied 
to OpenGL it is easier for the programmer to access OpenGL state variables. There are three types of 
memory that can be accessed: normal CPU memory, texture memory, and the frame buffer. At the present, 
geometry processing and fragment processing can be altered by writing programs called shaders whereas 
the rasterizer is fixed. Geometry processing works on vertices represented in four dimensional homogeneous 
coordinates. In the fixed function pipeline (which is the default if no shader is loaded by the application), 
the geometric processing includes: The modelview and projection transformations The assembly of groups 
of vertices between a glBegin and a glEnd into primitives such as lines, points, and ploygons. Clipping 
these primitives against the volume defined by glOrtho, gluPerspective, or glFrustum. Computing the modified 
Phong model (if lighting is enabled) at each vertex to determine a vertex color. Rasterizer  Outputs 
fragments ( potential pixels ) that are interior to primitives  Interpolates colors, depth, texture 
coordinates, and other per vertex variables to obtain values for each fragment  Not programmable  
Each fragment corresponds to a location in the frame buffer and has attributes such as color, depth, 
and textures coordinates that are obtained by interpolating the corresponding values as the vertices. 
However, the final color of a pixel is determined by the color from the rasterizer, and other factors 
including hidden surface removal, compositing, and texture mapping which are done as part of fragment 
processing. Fragment Processing Assigns color to each fragment and updates frame buffer  Handles hidden 
surface removal, texture mapping, and blending  Programmable through fragment program or fragment shader 
  Note that many of the operation that are carried out on a per vertex basis such as shading can be 
carried out on a per fragment basis through a fragment shader. For example, rather than using the vertex 
colors computed by the modified Phong model and then interpolating them across a primitive, the same 
model can be computed for each fragment because the rasterizer will interpolate normals and other quantities 
across each primitive. This method is called Gouraud or interpolated shading. GLSL  OpenGL Shading Language 
 C like language for writing both vertex and fragment shaders  Adds matrix and vector data types + 
overloading of operators  OpenGL state variables available to shaders  Variables can be passed among 
shaders and applications  Supported as a extension in earlier versions of OpenGL but is now part of 
the OpenGL standard. Matrix and vector types are 2, 3, and 4 dimensional. Although there are no pointers, 
we can pass matrices, vectors, and C-structs back and forth. Although the language is the same for vertex 
and fragment shaders, each has a different execution model. Vertex shaders are invoked for each vertex 
produced by the application; fragment shaders for each fragment that is produced by the rasterizer. GLSL 
has type qualifiers to identify variables that may be local to a shader, pass from a vertex shader to 
a fragment shader, and to identify input and output variables. The vertex shader is executed for each 
vertex defined in the application. Minimally every vertex shader must output a vertex position (gl_Position) 
to the rasterizer. A user defined vertex shader must do all the functions that the fixed geometric processor 
does. Hence, most vertex shaders must do the coordinate system changes usually done by the modelview 
and projection matrices on the application on the input vertex position (gl_Vertex). Since OpenGL state 
variables are available to the shader, we often see lines of code such as gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix*gl_ModeViewMatrix*gl_Vertex; 
in the shader. Most shaders also produce an output color (gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor) for each vertex. 
Here is a trival vertex shader that colors every vertex red and does the standard coordinate changes. 
const vec4 red = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); void main(void) { gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix*gl_Vertex; 
gl_FrontColor = red; } In this simple shader, a variable time is provided by the application. The product 
of the model-view and projection matrices (gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix) is provided by the state and 
is used to convert the position each vertex from object coordinates (gl_Vertex) to clip coordinates (gl_Position). 
The time variable is used to sinsusoidally vary the y component of the vertex. Finally the color set 
by the application (gl_Color) is sent as the front color (gl_FrontColor) along with the new position 
to the rasterizer. Vertex Shader Applications  General Vertex Lighting  Off loading CPU  Dynamic Meshes 
 Morphing  Additional Application Specific Vertex Attributes  Some basic fragment shader applications 
include: Vertex Lighting: Use models that either more physically realistic than the modified Phong model 
or are non photorealistic such as cartoon shading. Many operations can be done either in the CPU or the 
GPU. Often we can offload the CPU by pushing operations to the GPU. One example is creating waves on 
a mesh by sending a time parameter to the shader which controls mesh vertex heights sinusoidally thus 
creating waves. Particle system calculations are another example. Morphing involves interpolation between 
two sets of vertices. The interpolation can be done on the GPU. We can pass additional information on 
a per vertex basis to the GPU. For example, in a simulation we might have temperature or flow data at 
each vertex. In this example each vertex is rotated in the about the y axis by an angle dependent on 
its distance from the axis (twisting). Although we could do this operation in the application, by doing 
it in the shader we offload the CPU. The fragment shader is executed for each fragment output from the 
rasterizer. Every fragment program must produce a fragment color (gl_FragmentColor). Since each fragment 
has a location in the frame buffer, fragment locations cannot be altered. Vertex attributes, either bultin 
(gl_FrontColor) or application defined are available to the fragment shader with values that have been 
interpolated across the primitive. Tests such as depth are done after the fragment shader. Below is a 
simple fragment shader that passes through a color defined and output by the vertex shader (color_out) 
for each vertex that is interpolated across the primitive. varying vec3 color_out; void main(void) { 
gl_FragColor = color_out; } Simple Fragment Shader uniform float time; void main() { float d = length(gl_FragCoord.xy); 
gl_FragColor.r = 0.5*(1.0+sin(0.001*time))*gl_FragCoord.x/d; gl_FragColor.g = 0.5*(1.0+cos(0.001*time))*gl_FragCoord.y/d; 
gl_FragColor.b = gl_FragCoord.z; gl_FragColor.a = 1.0; } In this simple fragment shader the time variable 
provided by the application is used to vary the red and green components of each fragment s color sinusoidally. 
The location each fragment in the frame buffer (gl_FragCoord) is available from the state. Every fragment 
program must output a fragment color (gl_FragColor). Fragment shaders are more powerful than vertex 
shaders. With a fragment shader you can apply the lighting model to each fragment generated by the rasterizer 
rather than using interpolated values from each vertex. One example is bump mapping where the normal 
is altered at each fragment allowing the rendering of surfaces that are not smooth. Fragment shader also 
have access to textures so that multipass techniques such as environment maps can be carried out in real 
time. In this example, a diffuse color was computed for each fragment by using the interpolating normals 
and light vectors ouput by the rasterizer. A texture was also applied to each fragment. Per fragment 
lighting using the same model as a vertex shader or the default modified Phong model should result in 
a much smoother image. Linking with Application In OpenGL application, we must:  Read shaders  Compile 
shaders  Define variables  Link everything together   OpenGL 2.0 contains a set of functions for 
each of these steps  Similar to the initialization of other OpenGL application programs, a set of operations 
must be carried out to set up user written shaders and link them with an OpenGL application program. 
Shaders are placed in program objects. A program object can contain multiple shaders of each type. Just 
as with any program, a shader must be compiled and linked with other program entities. The linking stage 
sets up internal tables that allow the application to tie together variables in the shaders with variables 
in the application program. Compiling and Linking Shaders Creating a Shader Program Similar to compiling

 OpenGL ES  Designed for the embedded device space much smaller driver fewer function calls  multiple 
versions for the different pipelines   Integrates (through EGL) with other Khronos APIs  OpenVG for 
rendering vector graphics  OpenMAX for media acceleration   As we ve described throughout the course, 
the OpenGL ES interface is closely related to that of it s larger counterpart, OpenGL. As it was designed 
for the embedded device space, the driver has had many functions removed that remove redundant ways of 
doing the same things, such as specify geometry, which in OpenGL ES is only done through the use of vertex 
arrays. OpenGL and OpenGL ES are both APIs developed by the Khronos Group. Others include OpenVG for 
vector graphics, and OpenMAX for media acceleration, principally video. These interfaces are able to 
share data and images using the EGL interface. For example, you might decode a frame of video using OpenMAX 
and use it directly as a texture map in OpenGL ES. It should be noted that OpenGL isn t as integrated 
with the other Khronos APIs currently. OpenGL ES Versions  OpenGL ES 1.1 only implements a fixed-function 
pipeline fixed set of operations available  OpenGL ES 2.0 only implements a programmable pipeline 
 almost completely controlled by programmable shaders  very small interface, and only supports rendering 
   The two OpenGL ES interfaces, 1.1 and 2.0, implement the different version of the graphics pipeline 
 fixed-function and programmable which are both available in OpenGL. OpenGL ES 1.1 uses a large number 
of function calls to implement rendering, but also includes support for transformations and matrix stacks, 
Phong lighting, fog, and other features, each of which is controlled by specifying state using function 
calls. OpenGL ES 2.0, on the other hand, implements a programmable pipeline that where almost all graphics 
operations are done in shaders. As such, the interface is very small, and focused on only specify geometry 
and textures, and dealing with shaders and their variables. None of the functionality of the fixed-function 
pipeline is available. OpenGL 3.0 OpenGL 3.0 Completely backwards compatible with OpenGL 2.1  New
