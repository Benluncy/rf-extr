system with working vacations and impatient customers, where we exam­ine the case that customers impatience 
is due to a working vacation. During the working vacation, customers are served at a slower than usual 
service rate and are likely to become impatient. Each customer, upon arrival, activates an inde­pendent 
impatient timer , exponentially distributed. If a customer s service has not been completed before the 
cus­tomer s timer expires, the customer abandons the queue, never to return. We analyze this model and 
derive the probability generating functions of the number of customers present when the server is both 
in a service period and in a working vacation. We further obtain the closed-form expres­sions for various 
performance measures, including the mean system size, the mean sojourn time of a customer served, the 
proportion of customers served and the rate of abandonment due to impatience. Some numerical results 
are presented.  Keywords Queues, working vacations, impatience, probability generat­ingfunctions,meansystemsizes,sojourntimes. 
 1. INTRODUCTION Queueing systems with impatient customers appear in many real life situations such as 
those involving impatient telephone switchboard customers, hospital emergency rooms handling critical 
patients, and inventory systems that store perishable goods [1], [2]. There is growing interest in the 
analysis of queueing systems with impatient customers. This is due to their potential application in 
communication sys­tems, call centers, production-inventory systems and many * This work is supported

...$10.00. other related areas, see for instance [3]-[5] and the references therein. Queueing systems 
with impatient customers have been studied by a number of authors. There is an extensive amount of literature 
based on this kind of model. We men­tion a few of the more signi.cant works below. Palm s pi­oneering 
work [6] seems to be the .rst to analyze queue­ing systems with impatient customers by considering the 
M/M/c queue, where the customers have independent ex­ponentially distributed waiting times. Subsequently, 
several authors extended these results in various directions by relax­ing the exponential assumptions, 
see e.g., Daley [7], Takacs [8], Baccelli et al. [9], Boxma and de Waal [10], Van Houdt et al. [11], 
and Yue and Yue [12]. In all the aforementioned papers, the source of impatience has always been taken 
to be either a long wait already experienced upon arrival at a queue, or a long wait anticipated by a 
customer upon arrival. However, recently, Altman and Yechiali [13], [14] analyzed queueing models where 
customers become impatient only when the servers are on vacation and unavailable for service. In other 
words, the cause of the impatience is the absence of the server. The M/M/1, M/G/1 and M/M/c queues were 
investigated in [13], and the M/M/8 queue was investigated in [14]. Yechiali [15] considered the queueing 
models with system disasters where the customers become impatient only when the system is down. Economou 
and Kapodistria [16] extended this work by considering synchronized abandon­ments. Perel and Yechiali 
[17] analyzed queueing system operating in a 2-phase (fast and slow) Markovian random environment. When 
in the slow phase, customers became impatient due to a slow service rate. In these studies, it is assumed 
that the server stops service during the vacation. However, there are numerous situations where the server 
will not remain completely inactive during a vacation period. Rather, it will render service to the queue 
at a reduced rate. Servi and Finn [18] .rst introduced this type of vacation, which is called a multiple 
working vaca­tion, and analyzed an M/M/1/WV queue in which the ser­vice times during a regular service 
period, the service times during a working vacation, and the vacation times are all as­sumed to be distributed 
exponentially with di.erent rates. Analysis of a WDM optical access network using multiple wavelength 
which can be recon.gured, illustrates the work­ing of their model. Subsequently, several authors extended 
these results by relaxing the exponential assumptions, see e.g., Kim et al. [19], Wu and Takagi [20], 
Baba [21], Banik et al. [22], and Zhang and Hou [23]. However, to the best of our knowledge, for queueing 
sys­tems with a working vacation, there is no literature which takes customers impatience into consideration. 
In the present paper, we consider M/M/1 queueing systems with working vacations and impatient customers, 
where customers become impatient only when the server is on a working vacation. During the working vacation, 
the server works at a slow ser­vice rate rather than completely stopping, and customers become impatient 
due to a slow service rate. Each cus­tomer, upon arrival, activates an independent impatient timer T 
, exponentially distributed with parameter ..If the customer s service has not been completed before 
the customer s timer expires, the customer abandons the queue, never to return. The paper is organized 
as follows: In Section 2, we de­scribe the model. In Section 3, we carry out the equilibrium analysis 
of the system state and derive the probability gener­ating functions of the number of customers present 
when the server is both in a service period and in a working vacation. We further obtain the closed-form 
expressions for various performance measures including the mean system size, the mean sojourn time of 
a customer served, the proportion of customers served and the rate of abandonment due to impa­tience. 
Some numerical results are presented. Conclusions are given in Section 4.  2. MODEL DESCRIPTION We consider 
an M/M/1 queueing system in which cus­tomers arrive according to a Poisson process at rate ..The service 
is provided by a single server, who serves the cus­tomers on a .rst-come .rst-served (FCFS) basis. When 
the system is empty, the server begins a working vacation of mean duration 1/. (.> 0), where vacation 
times are exponentially distributed. If the server returns from a working vacation to .nd the system 
empty, it begins another vacation. Otherwise, it switches to a service period. The service times during 
a service period and a working vacation follow exponential distributions with a fast service rate µb 
(> 0) and a slow service rate µv (> 0), respectively. During the working vacation, customers become impa­tient. 
That is, whenever a customer arrives at the system, it activates an impatient timer T , exponentially 
distributed with parameter . (> 0). If the the customer s service has not been completed before the customer 
s timer expires, the customer abandons the queue, never to return. Remark 1. If µv = 0, the current model 
reduces to the M/M/1 queueing model with impatient customers and server vacations that was studied by 
Altman and Yechiali [13]. If . = 0, the current model reduces to the M/M/1 queues with working vacations 
that was studied by Servi and Finn [18].  3. STATIONARY ANALYSIS In this section, we present a stationary 
analysis for the model described in the last section. We .rst derive the probability generating functions 
of the number of customers present when the server is both in a service period and in a working vacation. 
Then, we derive the closed-form expres­sions for various performance measures including the mean system 
size, the mean sojourn time of a customer served, the proportion of customers served and the rate of 
abandonment due to impatience. 3.1 Generating Functions Let L denote the number of customers in the system, 
and let J denote the status of the server, which is de.ned as follows: J = 1 denotes that the server 
is in a service period, while J = 0 denotes that the server is in a working vacation. Then, the pair 
(J, L) de.nes a continuous-time Markov pro­cess with state space O = {0, 0}.{(j, n): j =0, 1; n = 1, 
2, ...}. Let Pjn = P {J = j, L = n} (j =0, 1; n =0, 1, 2, ...) denote the (steady state) system-state 
probabilities. Then, the set of balance equations is given as follows: .P00 =(µv + .)P01 + µbP11, (1) 
(. + . + µv + n.)P0n = .P0n-1 + [µv +(n +1).]P0n+1,n =1, (2) (. + µb)P1n = .P1n-1 + µbP1n+1 + .P0n,n 
=1(3) where P10 =0. De.ne the probability generating functions (PGFs) as 8 Gj(z)= Pjnz n,j =0, 1. n=0 
Then, multiplying each equation for n in Eqs. (1) and (2) by z n, and summing all possible values of 
n and re-arranging terms, we get S .z(1 -z)G0(z)+ f(z)G0(z)+ Az -B(1 -z)=0 (4) where f (z)= .z2 -(. + 
. + µv)z + µv, (5) A = µbP11 + .P00,B = µvP00, (6) d and GS0(z)= dz G0(z). Similarly, using Eq. (3) we 
obtain (.z -µb)(1 -z)G1(z)= z(.G0(z) -A). (7) Remark 2. (1) Letting µv = 0 in Eq. (4), we get S .(1 -z)G0(z)=[.(1 
-z)+ .]G0(z) -(µbP11 + .P00). This agrees with Altman and Yechiali [13] (see Eq. (2.4), p. 263). (2) 
Letting . = 0 in Eq. (4), we get µv(1 -z)P00 -z(µbP11 + .P00) G0(z)= . .z2 -(. + . + µv)z + µv This agrees 
with Servi and Finn [18] (see Eq. (A.3), in Appendix A, p. 49). We derive the solution of the di.erential 
Eq. (4) in the following section.  3.2 Solution of the Differential Equation For z =0 and z= 1, Eq. 
(4) can be written as follows: [] S..µv G0(z)+ - ++ G0(z)= ..(z -1) .z () Multiplying both sides of 
Eq. (8) by Summing all possible values of n in Eq. (18) yields µ .P0. + .P1. = µbP1. + µv(P0. - P00) 
- z(1 - z) e z , 8 weget +. (n +1)P0n+1. (19) n=0 µ z(1 - z) G0(z)z  = 8 Noting thatn=0(n +1)P0n+1 
= E(L0), and by substitut­ dz ing Eq. (17) into Eq. (19), we get - () 1 AB - . 1 - zz . . µ v - z (1 
- z) (9) ... e z . (. + .)(µb - .)=[.(µb - .)+ .(µb - µv)] P0. +.µvP00. (20) Integrating from 0 to z 
we have -Ak1(z)+ Bk2(z) From Eq. (10), using Eqs. (6) and (14), we have G0(z)= (10) . µ .v - z(1 - z) 
. .e ... z . . . e [-.P0.k1(1) + µvP00k2(1)] lim (1 - z)- z.1 G0(1) = . (21) where . z . . . µ 8- v --1

 z . . µ -.P0.k1(1) + µvP00k2(1) = 0. (22) v --1 x(1 - x)k2(z)=dx. (12) ... e x 0 Eq. (10) expresses 
G0(z)interms of A and B,orequiva­lently, P00 and P11. Also, from Eq. (7), G1(z) is a function of G0(z), 
P00 and P11.Thus, once P00 and P11 are cal­culated, G0(z)and G1(z) are completely determined. We derive 
the probabilities P00, P11 and the mean system sizes in the next subsection.  3.3 Mean System Sizes 
8 For j =0, 1, let Pj. = Gj(1) =n=0 Pjn,and let E(Lj)= 8 GS j(1) =nPjn. Then, by summing all possible 
values µb - . n=1 of n in Eq. (3), we get .P0. = µbP11 + .P00. (13) Hence, from Eq. (6) we get A = .P0. 
= .G0(1). (14) Then, Eq. (7) can be written as G1(z)= .z µb - .z · G0(1) - G0(z) 1 - z . (15) By using 
L Hopital rule, we derive G1(1) = . G0S (1) (16) where GS 0(1) = E(L0), de.ned as the mean number of 
cus­tomers when the server is on a working vacation. Since G1(1) = P1. =1 - P0., from Eq. (16), we get 
µb - . E(L0)= (1 - P0.). (17) . In order to obtain E(L0), we need to derive P0., de.ned as the proportion 
of time the server is on a working vacation. By summing Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) and re-arranging terms, we 
get {d .P0n + .P1n - µbP1n+1 +[µv +(n +1).] P0n+1= .P0n-1 + .P1n-1 - [µbP1n +(µv + n.)P0n] ,n = 1. Using 
this recursive relation and Eq. (1), we get .P0n + .P1n =[µv +(n +1).] P0n+1 +µbP1n+1,n = 0. (18) Solving 
Eqs. (20) and (22), we obtain (. + .)(µb - .)k2(1) P0. = , (23) .2k1(1) + [.(µb - .)+ .(µb - µv)] k2(1) 
.k1(1) P00 = P0.. (24) µvk2(1) Then, E(L0) is obtained from Eq. (17), and P11 is obtained from Eq. (13). 
Now, knowing P00 and P11, any probabilities P0n and P1n, for n = 1, can be calculated progressively by 
using Eqs. (2) and (3), starting with n =1. Next, we derive E(L1), de.ned as the mean number of customers 
when the server is in the service period. From Eq. (15), by using L Hopital rule, we derive E(L1)= lim 
G1S (1) z.1 {} . 1 SS µb = G0 (1) + E(L0). (25) µb - . 2 µb - . By di.erentiating twice for Eq. (4) at 
z =1, we get fSS(1)G0(1) + 2(fS(1) - .)G0S (1) + SS (f(1) - 2.)G0 (1) = 0. (26) It is easy to see that 
f(1) = -., fS(1) = . - (µv + .), and fSS (1) = 2..Since G0(1) = P0.,and GS 0(1) = E(L0), from Eq. (26), 
we get 1 SS .. + . + µv - . G0 (1) = P0. - E(L0). (27) 2 . +2.. +2. Substituting Eqs. (17) and (27) into 
Eq. (25) and re­arranging terms, we get .. E(L1)= P0. (µb - .)(. +2.) () .. + . - µv ++ (1 - P0.) (28) 
µb - .. +2. where P0. is given by Eq. (23). Thus, the mean system size can be calculated by E[L]= E[L0]+ 
E[L1]. Remark 3. From Eq. (16), we get that the necessary and su.cient condition for stability is .<µb. 
Since Eq. (16) 8 holds if and only .<µb, for otherwise G1(1) = n=1 P1n = 8 0and GS 0(1) = n=1 nP0n =0, 
which leads to P0n = P1n = 0,n = 1,P00 =1.  3.4 Sojourn Times Let S be the total sojourn time of a customer 
in the sys­tem, measured from the moment of arrival until departure, either completion of service or 
as a result of abandonment. Then, by Little s law, we have 1 E[S]= (E[L0]+ E[L1]) . (29) . However, a 
more important measure of performance is Sserved, de.ned as the total sojourn time of a customer who 
com­pletes his service. Let Sjn be the conditional sojourn time of a customer who does not abandon the 
system, given that the state upon his arrival is (j, n). Clearly, we have n +1 E[S1n]= ,n =1, 2, .... 
(30)µb Now, for n =0, 1, 2, ...,we derive E[S0n]byusing the method used by Altman and Yechiali [14]. 
For n = 1, ( )( ) . 1 . 1 E[S0n]= + E[S1n]+ + E[S0n].n+1 .n+1 .n+1 .n+1 () n. + µv 1 ++ E[S0n-1](31).n+1 
.n+1 where .n = .+.+n.+µv for n =0, 1, 2, .... The second term above follows since a new arrival does 
not change the sojourn time of a customer present in the system, while the third term takes into account 
the probability n/(n+1) that, when there is an abandonment among n+1 waiting customers, our customer 
will not be the one to leave. Thus, substituting Eq. (30) into Eq. (31), we have E[S0n]= an + ßnE[S0n-1],n 
=1, 2, ... (32) where [] 1 .n (n +1). an =+ , (33) . +(n +1). + µv .n+1 µb n. + µv ßn = . (34) . +(n 
+1). + µv We also have ()( ) . 11 . 1 µv E[S00]= ++ + E[S00]+ , .2 .1 .1 µb .1 .11 implying that () 1 
.0 . E[S00]= + . (35) . + . + µv .1 µb Iterating Eq. (32) we obtain, for n = 1, nn E[S0n]= an + ai-1 
ßj (36) i=1 j=i where an and ßn are given by Eqs. (33) and (34). Finally, the expected sojourn time of 
a customer that is served may be calculated by using the expression: 88 E[Sserved]= P1nE[S1n]+ P0nE[S0n]. 
n=1 n=0 That is, 8 1 E[Sserved]= (E[L1]+ P1.)+ P0nE[S0n] (37) µb n=0 where P1. =1 - P0. can be obtained 
from Eq. (23). 3.5 Other Performance Measures The other two important performances are the proportion 
of customers served, denoted by Pserved, and therateof abandonment due to impatience, denoted by Raband. 
Clearly, the expected number of customers served per unit of time is µbP1. +µv(P0. -P00), implying that 
the proportion of customers served is 1 Pserved =[µbP1. + µv(P0. - P00)] . (38) . The rate of abandonment 
due to impatience is given by Raband =. - [µbP1. + µv(P0. - P00)] =.E[L0] (39) where the second equality 
follows from Eq. (19). Alternatively, when the system is in state (0,n), n = 1, the rate of abandonment 
of a customer due to impatience is n.,thus 8 Raband = .nP0n = .E[L0], (40) n=1 which agrees with Eq. 
(39).  3.6 Numerical Results In this subsection, we investigate the e.ects of some pa­rameters on the 
performance measures of the system. In Table 1, the variations of E[L0], E[L1], E[L], E[S], Pserved and 
Raband are presented for various µb and ., where . =4, µv =2 and . =2. Table 1: Performance Measures

Table 1, we can see that the mean number E[L0] seems to be more sensitive to the parameter . than the 
mean number E[L1]. Table 1 also exhibits that E[L0], E[L], E[S], and Raband all increase with µb while 
E[L1]and Pserved decrease with µb. However, all these performance measures decrease with .. In Table

in queues have been studied by various authors in the past, where the source of impatience has always 
been taken to be either a long wait already experienced upon arrival at a queue, or a long wait anticipated 
by a customer upon arrival. In this paper we have studied M/M/1 queueing systems with working vaca­tions 
and impatient customers, where the customers impa­tience is due to a slow service rate in a working vacation. 
We have derived probability generating functions of the number of customers present and the corresponding 
mean system sizes when the server was both in a service period and in a working vacation. Also, we have 
obtained closed-form expressions for other performance measures, including the mean sojourn time of a 
customer served, the proportion of customers served and the rate of abandonment due to impa­tience. The 
e.ects of some parameters on the performance measures of the system have been investigated numerically.
