ABSTRACT Marsaglia and Zaman recently proposed a new class of random number generators, acid-with-carr~ 
and subtract­with-borrow, which are capable of quickly generating very long period (pseudo) -random number 
sequences using very little memory. We show that these sequences are es­sentially equivalent to linear 
congruential sequences with very large prime moduli. As a consequence, the theoret­ical properties of 
such generators can be studied in the same way as for linear congruential generators, namely via the 
spectral and lattice tests. 1. THE AWC AND SWB GENERATORS Marsaglia and Zaman (1991) recently proposed 
two new types of random number generators, called add-with­carry (AWC) and subtract-with-borrow (SWB). 
The AWC generator is based on the recursion Xi = (z,_. + x,_. + c,) mod b, (1) C;+l ~ I~zi-s + ~i.-r 
+ C, z b), (2) where r > s are positive integers called the lags, ci is called the carry, and 1 is the 
indicator function, whose value is 1 if its argument is true, and O otherwise. That generator is extremely 
fast, since it requires no multiplication, and the modulo operation can be performed by just subtracting 
b if t,-, + 21 . + c, ~ b. The maximum possible (or full) period is br+ b -2. It is attained when J4 
= b +b 1is prime and b is a primitive root modulo ill. For example, one can take b around 231 and r 
around 20, yielding a mo if the full period conditions period of approximately 2 are satisfied. This 
is much beyond what could be required by any application. When b is large enough (see James 1990), one 
can produce a /7(0, 1) variate at each step by U;= Z, b. (3) I More generally, one can use L successive 
values of Zj Pierre L Ecuyer D6partement d I.R.O. Universit6 de Montr&#38;l C.P. 6128, Succ. A, Montr6al 
H3C 3J7, CANADA  to produce one u, as follows: L 1 ut = ~Li+jb j L . (4) x J=o If b is small, or if 
more precision is desired, take a larger -L. Here, it is important to note that the digits of ~i are 
filled up from the least significant to the most significant one. The sequence (4) is an analogue of 
the Tausworthe sequence (Tausworthe 1965). For the latter, the digits of u, are filled up by a linear 
feedback shift register sequence modulo two (so, b = 2). The SWB is based on a similar recursion: x, 
= (z,_. -z;.-. -c,) mod b, (5) C,+l = l(Z, . -$; , -C, < O), (6) where r > s. Here, c, is called the 
borrow. The maximum possible period is b -b , and is achieved when M = br bs +1 is prime and b is a primitive 
root modulo M. The w s can be produced from the ZJ s in the same way. For a full period AWC or SWB generator, 
the xi s are provably almost equidistributed in up to r dimensions, i.e., among all (overlapping) r-dimensional 
vectors of successive values of z; s, over the whole period, every r-dimensional vector with components 
in {O, . . . . b 1} appears exactly once, except for a tiny percentage of exceptions (Marsaglia and 
Zaman 1991), The AWC and SWB methods can be viewed as vari­ants of the so-called additive or subtractiue 
met hods rec­ommended in Knuth (1981). Marsaglia and Zaman (1991) have given a list of parameter sets 
for AWC and SWB gen­erators, for which the order of b modulo M is very large or near to the maximum. 
Those generators do not have full period, but a large period anyway. Finding full pe­riod generators 
with a very large period is hard, because checking the primitivity with a very large prime modulo is 
a difficult task in practice. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the sequence u,, i=l,2 >...9 
produced by an AWC or an SWB genera­tor. That sequence turns out to be essentially the same as 443 Tezuka 
and L Ecuyer the sequence produced by a linear congruentia.l generator (LCG). More precisely, wehave 
the following. Let Lf= U +bS -1 for AWC, and M = b b +1 for SWB. Suppose that M is prime and let b* 
be the multiplicative inverse of b modulo M, i.e., such that b b mod M = 1. That in­verse can be computed 
easily as b = bM-2 mod M. Con­sider the following (LCG) with modulo M and multiplier A = (b*)L mod M 
= b~M-2JL mod M: X, = AX:.1 mod M, (7) Wi = Xi/M. (8) Our main result is: THEOREM 1. Let {u,, z ~ O} 
be the sequence (4) pro­duced by an AWC or SWB generator, while {w,, i z O} is the sequence produced 
by (8). Then, if XO is chosen appropriately, one has (9) foralli>rd The condition XO is chosen appropriately 
means that the two sequences must have corresponding initial seeds. Otherwise, (9) will hold after an 
appropriate shift of one of the two sequences. Equation (9) means that u, is a truncated version of w,: 
only the first L fractional digits in base b are kept, the others are chopped off. As a con­ sequence, 
Iu, -w,l < b L. In other words, the sequences (4) and (8) are the same, if they have corresponding initial 
seeds, up to a precision of b-L. For example, it could be reasonable to take b > 230 and L = 2, in which 
case the first 60 bits of u, and w, will be the same. So, for all prac­tical purposes, considering the 
limited precision of floating point numbers on computers, one can safely assume that U;= WS. We call 
(7 8) the LCG representation of the corre­sponding AWC or SWB generator. In Section 2, we sketch briefly 
a proof of our main result and show how to obtain the state of the LCG representation from the state 
of an AWC generator, and vice-versa, For a theoretical evalua­tion of the structural properties of an 
AWC or SWB gener­ator, one can study the lattice structure of its LCG repre. sentation. In Section 3, 
we do that on some examples, in­cluding a small family of generators taken from Marsaglia and Zaman (1991), 
to which we apply the spectral and Beyer tests. To apply these tests, we used the software package described 
in L Ecuyer and Couture (1992), which is still under development, and based in part on the algo­rithms 
given in Afflerbach and Grothe (1985) and Fincke and Pohst (1985). Observe that if the multiplier A in 
(7) is replaced by its inverse A* = bL mod M, then it will produce the same sequence, but in reverse 
order. Since the reverse sequence has the same lattice structure as the original one, applying the spectral 
or Beyer test with the multiplier A* or A will yield the same results. A more detailed version of this 
paper, with all the proofs and further results, is currently in preparation. For a survey of random number 
generation for simulation, see L Ecuyer (1990). 2. SWITCHING BETWEEN THE AWC AND LCG REPRESENTATIONS 
In this section, we sketch the proof of the main result and show how one can switch from the AWC (or 
SWB) sequence to its LCG representation, and vice-versa. For simplification, we will assume here that 
L = 1 and will consider the AWC generator. The more general case (L > 1) and the SWB generator can be 
analyzed in a similar way. Consider the LCG (7). Since b* is the multiplicative inverse of b, one also 
has X, l = bX, mod M. From that, X; is now defined for all integers i G ~. Now, let W, = XtJM = .xixt-lxi-2 
. . . . (lo) where the right-hand-side denotes the digital expansion of X,/M in base b. For each i, 
define co Then, one can show that that C,+l must be O or 1, and that the sequence {(Z;, ci+l), a 6 Z!} 
satisfies the recursion (l 2). Further, ~i = ~i/b = [bw,]/b, which is (9). From (11), one can transform 
the state (Z, _r~l, . . . . x,, c,+l) of the AWC generator into the state X, of its LCG representation. 
Reciprocally, by expanding wi = X,/m in base b, one recovers Zi, c,_l, ., , , Z;-rj and then compute 
ci using the fact that c, = 1 if and only if (z, -r + x,-. + 1 z,) mod b= O. It is important to note 
that the transformation from the LCG state to the AWC state is not onto. Indeed, if the LCG has full 
period, it has M -1 (non trivial) possible states. On the other hand, the AWC generator has 2b possible 
states, which is more than twice M 1. So, many different AWC states can be mapped to the same X,. It 
turns out, however, that for all initial states of the AWC except (O, . . . . O, O)and(b 1,..., b 1, 
1) (which must be avoided), the period is equal to the order of b modulo M (which is M 1 if the LCG 
has full period). Further, the length of the initial transient is at most r. This explains the i > T 
at the end of the statement of Theorem 1. tbi+l c Figure 1: All Pairs of Successive Points 3. EXAMPLES, 
LATTICE STRUCTURE, AND SPECTRAL TEST 3.1. Example 1 As a first example, we consider the a SWB generator 
with (bjs, T,L) = (2, 2, 9, 9). Here, Zi = (zi-z Zi-g c;) mod 2, s l J=(I and the period is 29 -22 
= 508, Figure 1 shows a two­dimensional plot of the pairs of successive points (tti, tii+l ) produced 
by this generator over its entire period. The starting values were (z1, .... x9, C1O) = (1, O, .... O). 
This looks like a typical lattice structure of a (bad) LCG. The LCG representation of that SWB generator 
is X; = 170X;_, mod 509; w, = x./5o9. Note that 170 is the inverse of 29 (= 3) modulo 509. Since ai is 
just the truncated version of ~i, the points produced by the SWB generator do not form exactly a lattice: 
those 1.0 ~g for the SWB Generator of Example 1 with sharp eyes can see that the points in Figure 1 
are not exactly aligned on the three lines. However, everybody will agree that the approximation is quite 
good. If the multiplier 170 was replaced by 3, we would get the same graphic, but reflected with respect 
to the diag­onal ~i = lJI+l . Hence, the points of the LCG represen­tation will be on three lines of 
slope 3 instead of slope 1/3. 3.2. Example 2: A Classroom AWC Generator we now examine the classroom 
AWC generator given in Section 7 of Marsaglia and Zaman (1991), for which (b,s, r, L) = (6,2, 21, L). 
The sequence is defined by L-1 zLI+j6~jui=~ T ,=0 where ~i is generated by x, = (~;-zl + ~i-z + ci) 
mod 6, We will look at different values of L. Since M = 621 + 62 1 = 21,936,950,640,377,891 is prime 
and b = 6 is a primitive root modulo M, the sequence of z i s have Tezuka and L Ecuyer L7 A 3760617870802950

X,=(6 )~X~_1 modkf; wi = Xi/M. The following values of L are relatively prime to M 1: L = 1,3,7,9,11, 
17,19. For small L, like 1 or 3, the resolution is much too low and as a result, the LCG is not a good 
approximation of the AWC sequence. We have applied the spectral and Beyer tests to the corresponding 
LCG S for the other values of L. The results are given in Table 1. The values d~ and q~ are respectively 
the distance between hyperplanes in the unit hypercube, and the Beyer quotient, in dimension t,For more 
details on the Beyer and spectral tests, see L Ecuyer (1990). It turns out that for all values of L, 
the lattice struc­ture is bad in low dimensions, In fact, it is amazing to see how terrible are some 
of those multipliers in lower dimen­sions (e.g., for L = 17 and L = 19). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was
