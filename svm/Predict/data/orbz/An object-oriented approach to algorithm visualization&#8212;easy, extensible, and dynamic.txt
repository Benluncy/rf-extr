Lawrence University napst@lawrence.edu Brian Swander, Lawrence University 90280 @lawrenoe.edu ABSTRACT 
 A key component of oor attempt to integrate the object+fiented paradigm into introductory and interrnedMe 
comses is algorithm viatudization. Such vieualiition depicts an algorithm as a sequence of graphical 
Snapshotsof data Stmcnmm that are operated upott at inten%ting events in the algorithm s execution. Using 
object-oriented techniques, we have eigdficantly enhanced a ptwioua version of the algorithm viauaMation 
system called GAIQS, developed at Lawrence-llwse enfmncementa allow inatnmtom end students to develop 
dynendc vieualimtions with relative ease aud, if deaiia extend the graphic operations that are built 
into GAIGS to allow more pemmtelkd visualizations. The resulting aofhvare package is being used m a core 
of coumeaasa meauaof ilhmtmting the power of the object+riented approach while at the same time advancing 
students understanding of difficult algorithms. Because of the extensibility of the object+xiented featmss 
of the system, we envision many More epplicetinna in which it could be used. To encoumge the development 
of such applications, tbe system is convrmiently available via ftp. BACKGROUND In 1991 Lawrmce University 
received en NSF ILI gmrtt (USE 9250793) for the express purpose of incmpmating the object+x%snted ~:gm 
into a com of four intmductoq end intermediate coursew Introduction to Computer Science (s CS1 course), 
Principles of Software Desigo (a CS2 coarse), Systems Analysis end Design, and Data Structural/Algorithm 
Analysis. Our success in this project relies upon making students appreciate the power of ektmction inherent 
in the ob@t­ otiented approach to software development. This power manifests itself in tools th* once 
learnx allow studentato ccwentrate on algorithms instead of the syntax-laden code that implements the 
algorithms. For instanw, in the systems analysis and design course, students cart use GUI classes such 
as those provided by Bmiand s IluboVbdoo for PCs and MPW S MSCAPP for Macintoahea. In tie fntroductkm, 
Priuciplea, end Data Structuma mums, students am often given object libraries for classical data atmctmw 
such es arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, bmery tree-e,general tmea, srsPM end netwo* (wei@@f g@@. 
tic= they understand the interfaces to these data structure classes, they can develop aopbiaticeted algorithms 
very quickly becausethey no longer must code end debug the implementations of the structures that their 
algorithms manipulate. In additicit to the above, we also want to use GOP to make the study of computer 
science viauatly exciting for our atndants. A panel at the 1993 SIGCSE symposium addreseedthe possibilities 
of itt~rpomtbtg graphics into courses across the computer science curriculum [2]. A central theme of 
thk panel was that students become energized for further Permission to copy without fee ell or pert of

es a sequence of diacmte snapshots that the viewer can proceed through at her own pace. Though petbaps 
1s8sSophisticated graphically than Systems that do trw algorithm animation (e.g., MscBALSA sod XTaugo), 
the eyetanrthat we ve developed has mte distinct pedagogic advantage -the ebi~ to mwrnd art algorithm 
to a ptevioua atate of its executim and review a aubaequmca of the previously presented snapshots. w-thisCapsbilby,studentsCal 
easily become lost in viewing an algorithm s executim and revert to passively gazing instead of actively 
using the AV system asa leandng tool. The failure of meny rdgorithrn animation systems to provide a rewind 
faciMy is rec@zod as a serious pedagogic weakness [8]. GAIGS (Gmeraliaed Algorithm Illustration through 
Graphical Softwrus), Veraion 2.x, is an AV system developed at Lawrence from 19W-1P90. A paper at the 
1990 SIdCSE Symposium d~ how we have inmrporated AV (using GAIGS) into computer science leboratoty sessions 
[4]. GAIGS wee also the primary vehicle used et workshops on algorithm vimaWation presented under the 
auspices of the NSF% undergraduate Facrdty Udmrtcement Program (Appleton, WI -1991) and the ACM SK3C!SE 
Symposium @neaa Cii, MO -1992). It has been used by computer science faculty at over sixty inatitutkma. 
WMt the advent of ourobject-orktted project, we set about improving GAIGS. The matd~ GAIGS Veraion 3.0, 
uses object-oriented methodology to achieve three goak 1. We want to make it easier for algorithmedciana 
(students and facdty) to Cmattuct viadxadona of a@bhrna.  2. GAIGS 2x drew snapshots of eight basic 
data structures. We want algorithmeticiane to be able to extend the display capsbilitiea of GAIGS beyond 
these eight built-in etrwuma. In effect we wrmt to allow the algorithmeticiau to match the display capabilities 
of GAIGS to her own pemonelized mental vieualiion of an algorithm s actions. 3. GAIGS 2.x was a static 
viaualiaer of algorithms ht the sensethat the algorithm must firat run to oompletim, producing a fide 
of snapshots which are than loaded into GAIGS for graphic rendering. We want GAIGS to be a dynamic viaurdii%r 
of algorithms. lltat is, the algorithm should run under the cmtml of GAIGS. When en intermtiog event 
in the algorithm occurs, GAIGS should display that event rather then having the event written to a file 
that GAIGS loads after the algorithm s execution.  GAIGS 3.0 bea ma these goals by employing the object-oriented 
featurea of Borland Psscal 7.0 the source language for GAIGS and many of the algorithms it viaualii. 
By doing SO,we have developed a tool that combmes graphica and GGP to make the study of algorithms visually 
interesting for our students. MAKING IT EASY TO CONSTRUCT VISUALIZATIONS Thekeytomaking viaualizatica 
eaayiatotmatitaaao abstraction. We noted earlier that we have developed (in Borland PaacsJand C++) object 
libraries for classical data structures. l%eeeclass libraries typically provi&#38; a method for each 
operation on the data structure. For inatanee, our Borland Pascal object Iibmry for the stack ADT is 
declared as follows. StackNodePtr = StackNode; StackNode = RECORD Data :pointer; Next :StackNodePtr END 
; . Stack OBJECT private top : StackNodePtr; lpn : in teger; Public -CONSTRUCTOR Ini t (Iinespernode 
: in teger); DESTRUCTOR Des troy; FUNCTION Empty : boolean; FUNCTION OnTop : pointer; PROCEDURE Push 
(item: pointer ) ; FUNCTION POP : pointer; PROCEDURE PrintNode(i tem:pointer; VZR F:text); VIRTUAL; PROCEOVRE 
Show(VAR ShoFiZe : text ; TS: Ti tleString ); VIRTUAL; END ; (* Stack object *) Ignoring the MWed poxtkns 
of this declaratiq we fmd oumelves with puMIc access to the usual operations ss a stack of generic pointem. 
Generic pointere amuaedso that anytype ofdatamay bestomd inthe stack. The abstraction of visdzatioo ia 
incorporated in the italicized PrintNode and Show methods. Given a stack S, we aend a Show message to 
S wherewe want S to produce a viaualintion of itself. he tit is that a snapshot of the stack S is sent 
to the text fiie Shofde with the accompanying caption TS. llds snapshot can then be mdemd by GAIGS. lhe 
Show that we provide is without frills in that it provide-s a plain, black-on-white rendering of the 
stack. Show is alao vhtutd. Hence, should an algorithmetician have a particular kind of derived stack 
for which ccdom will enhance the ma-she can rewdte Show for this derived stack Vl= lhe PrintNode method 
is pure virlual in the sense that any aigonthmetician using our stack type must derive a class fmm it 
in which the PrintNode method is implemented. Relative to viauakadon, PrintNode is wed by the Show method 
to determine how one element (node) of the stack should appear. Every abstract data type in our object 
library employs PrintNode and Show in these same contexts, so they are abstmcdona that users of the library 
quickly become familiar with. As an example, suppoeethat we want to ccmtmctaviadzationof the system stack 
during execution of the recumive Towera of Hanoi algorithm. We start with a typical Towem of Hanoi pmcdure. 
PROCEDURE Hanoi (Number discs : integer; Source, Intermediate, Destination :string) ; BEGIN IF Numberdiecs=l 
THEN SwitchDiscs (Sour ce, Destination) ; ELSE BEGIN Hanoi (Number discs-l, Source, Destination, Intermediate) 
; SwitchDiscs (Sour ce, Destination) ; Hanoi (Numberdiscs -1, Intermediate, Source, Destination) ; END 
END; ( Of PROCEDURE Hanoi ] We then must derive a ptimdar stack object from the haae Stack ob@ct described 
earlier. This new stack object is to be a stack of fmrnee that would atoxs parameters to Hanoi and the 
return point from each mcurdve call. FrameStack PROCEDURE END ; -PrintNVIRT OBJECT ode (UAL ; (Stack)

for a node on a FrameStack. In particular, one node of such a stack will cmsist of five textuai lines, 
as illuatmted in Figure 1. Hence FmmeStack s PrintNode iw PROCEDURE FI ameS tack. Pr intNode (It em:

THEN writeln(AlgoFile, Return to SwitchDisks ) ELSE IF FramePointer (Item) . RetPt -2 THEN writeln 
(AlgoFile, Return to end of Hanoi ) ELSE writeln (AlgoFile, Return point -main ) ; END ; To complete 
the viauabd version of the algorithm, we augment the Hanoi procedure with calls that send a Show message 
to the stack of fames at the points where interesting events occur, that ia, as we ester Hanofi as we

llda pmnise &#38;kcta au attitude recently sdvomted by Rettig, Simona, and Thomson P], namely that every

node list by badstructum. Dmw!ilructure atoms in a GKS-lii segment the graphical prhnitivu that will 
render the snapshot. The segment containing these printitivea esn be redrawn anytime the viewer wsnta 
to rewind the algorithm to a previous atate. To mate a gmphic of the three Hanoi towers that complements 
the view consisting of the stack frame% the algorithmetieian would have to extend the object hierarchy 
for !hwture~ to include a new object. Below this new @ject is identified as HsnTower. HanTower = OBJECT

END; /Uler defining the textual form that a HanTower snapshot would take and adding statements to the 
Hanoi procedure that direct such textual output to the algorithms s snapshot file, she would then have 
to write Load!ltmcture and DmwStnmture methods for this new object. Ihe new object type and its methcda 
are then linked into GAIGS. When GAIGS (augmented by the HanTower atrochue) nma and the viewer chooses

Recapping, all the algoritbmetician must do to add new structures and viewa for them to GAIGS is 1) augment 
the algorithm to produce a textual rapnxentation of such a ahuctme, 2) write a parser (LOadStructure) 
to load the textual repmaedation of the structure into GAIGS internal node 1~ and 3) write a gmphical

THE ALGORITHM DYNAMICALLY Aa described to this poinL GAIGS will still render the Towers of MI (or any 
other) algorithm statically. The algorithm must first execute, writing ita snapshots in textural form 
to SDASCII fiie. @er the algotithm temdaatea, the snapshots in this ASCII fde are then loaded and rendered 
in GAIGS. To vkualixe the algorithm dynamically, we must be able to start the algorithm fmm within the 
t3AICiS mwhonmerrt and have GAIGS render a snapshot 66 the algorithm reaches the caresponding interesting 
event in ita exemticn, not after the algorithm txmcludea. Achieving such dynamic viauelizatkm is surprisingly 
simple when approached from so below. l--Algotype >ShowDumrsyAlgo iteratively >.Sorter ~uickSorter >HeapSorter

to create their own personalized vhmkations of algorithms in a variety of courses. We hope this abii~ 
will inmase their tmdemtanding and enthusiasm for the material Wmg studied as well as providing learning 
tools to be used by other stu&#38;nts studying the same material. 2. Reid-time dynamic viauakm ens of 
algorithms will enable AV to become mom interactive, that is, the viewer cau interact with the algorithm 
as it is Mmg visurdii This should open new avenues of exploration for tie viewer, for example, bdmg able 
to dynamically change the heuristic in a network search algorithm as we vimrdly detec%that the old heuristic 
is ltimg us astray. 3. Because the aigoritbmeticiao can now add new information atructurw and instructions 
for their rendering to GAIGS, it dmuld be possible for GAIGS to visualize a vast new spectrum of kehaviom 
that can be viewed as transformations in the state of a system over time. lbese behaviors mnat no longer 
be limited strictly to computer science rdgorithma. 1% inatauce, them is no reasonwhyabiologist couldnotuseGAIGS 
astheviewing shellto visualize the changes in a marine ecological system over time (a projectthathasalreadybeensuggestedbyalocalbiologist). 
Indeed GAIGS could now beusedasaframework for avari~ of scientific visualizations --we need only be able 
to define the state of the visualized system as a textual snapshot and then defhw the approptiste LosdSttuctnm 
sod DmwStmctum methods for GAIGS rendering of such a snapshot. 4. Pteaently GAIGS visualizes an algorithm 
s Wmaforrnations of a data  atmctum but does not simultaneously display the de for that algorithm. In 
this regard an effective addition to GAIGS would be the capeldlity to view a code window highlighting 
that potion of tbecOdethat affected acatsintranaforrnstiononadatastmctnm. According to Schweitzer [9], 
this ode window should not be a detailed rdgofithm as implemented in a computer language such as Pascal 
or C, but rather a paendocade version of the algodthm that will rdlow the viewer to focus conceptually 
on the tmosformations affected by the algorithm. AVAILABILIN OF GAIGS 3.0 Our experience with earlier 
versions of GAIGS was that our own perspective on algorithm vianabtion was greatly broadenedby comments 
we received from its users --both at Lawrence and other Mitutions. We hope for similar results with GAIGS 
3.0 aml as suclL would like to diatrlbnte it to anyone interwted in using the viaualiions that are furnished 
with it or in mmtmcdng theii own viw&#38;&#38;ma. lhe former requires nothing more than GAIGS itself. 
The latter requkes that you have Borland Paacrd7.0 to link your new objects into GAIGS. To receive a
