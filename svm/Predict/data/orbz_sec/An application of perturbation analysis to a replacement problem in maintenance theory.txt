qj(t) = residual service time of component j in service at epoch t, ti = the ith replacement epoch, 7-:+1 
= ti+l ti, time between the ith and (i + 1 )st replacement epoch. Note that the service time is not 
really the true service time, since early replacement can occur ac­cording to Qz. Intuitively, the estimator 
is the sum of the following types of terms: (EXCHANGE RATE), (~;p( ) -~:~pfi)) . (1) The first term 
is a probability rate of exchange of crit­ical events conditioned at the ith replacement epoch, whereas 
the second term is the expected effect of this exchange. For example, in our system, one exchange we 
will consider is from y to @ at a component: the immediate effect is a reduction in cost of CR, but there 
are further effects, since in the former case, a compo­nent is replaced and in the latter, an old one 
is left in. The latter case is the PP sample path (under a certain limit) and the former is the DNP sample 
path (under a certain limit). To shorten notation a bit, we introduce the super­scripted i to indicate 
quantities at the ith replace­ment epoch tf (assumeright continuity). We will use the subscript * to 
indicate the index of the com­ponent which generates the next replacement epoch, e.g., ~; indicates the 
age of the service time at f~ of the component which will generate the (i + 1 )st replace­ment epoch, 
and e~+l indicates the event occurring at component ~ at time tj+1.We also introduce ~~ = max{6~ v; 
: e~+l = -y}(O if empty), Figure 1 depicts the three possible situations for a component j # *. In the 
first situation, an early re­placement (~) occurs at ti+l,because the component has already exceeded 
@z by that epoch, whereas in the second and third situations, the component is still too young (~). The 
difference between the second and third situations comes in their service times: in the third situation, 
the component will fail before it ever reaches 6$, whereas in the second situaticm, there is a possibility 
that early replacement will occur before failure. The quantity ~i is taken over components in the first 
situation, whereas rli is taken over all com­ponents. Essentially, &#38; is the time from tithat a component 
last exceeded the threshold L9z (reached the qualification age for early replacement) prior to ti+l,whereas 
qi is the time from tithat a com­ponent is first scheduled to either exceedl 02 or fail following the 
replacement epoch ti+l. We will use a subscripted - to indicate the index of the compo­nent corresponding 
to <i (if any) and + to indicate the index of the component corresponding to qi; from the definitions, 
there will always be a + component but not necessarily a - component. It is also pos­sible that the same 
component be both the + and if it corresponds to the first situation of Figure 1. Under our conditioning, 
&#38; and q, will provide lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the random vari­able ri+l, the time 
to the next replacement epoch given by T~+l = Y; v:. The quantities used in the conditioning arguments 
are depicted in Figure 2. As presented in Fu and Hu (1992), both right-hand and left-hand gradient estimators 
are available in gen­eral. For our problem, we will consider only the right­hand gradient, since it can 
be shown that the two are equal in expectation. A summary of analysis is as follows: AOl >0: accumulated 
perturbations may cause an inter­vention to occur relatively earlier such that no event occurs (~) for 
a component where there was an early preventive intervention (~) before; e.g., if component j was originally 
in the first situation of Figure 1, perturbations could cause ti+l to occur earlier (relative to j) 
such that the timing at j becomes that of the second situation;  conversely, accumulated perturbations 
may cause an intervention to occur relatively later such that  an early preventive replacement (~) occurs 
for a component where there was no event (0) before, preempting the original replace­ ment epoch, e.g., 
going from the second sit­uation in Figure 1 to the first; or (b) another component generates the replace­ment 
epoch (a), arising from the first or third situation shown in Figure 1; 332 Fu, Hu, and Shi Ae~ >0:

The possibilities discussed above translate into the following five cases to consider: Yj >82 where [.]

no such replacement (q$). At each replacement epoch ti, we condition on basi­ cally everything except 
the actual value Y:, which de­ termines -ti+lthrough Ti+l, the distribution of which we wish to derive. 
In particular, at ti, we condition on {vj,e~l, j = 1,..., AT}, {~ , j # *}, I{Yj > 62}, (where 1 is the 
indicator function) i.e., we condition Figure 1:, Three possible situations on the age of the component

the case just considered, where only the type of event was affected, and not the actual timtng of replacement 
epochs, here there can be propagation of perturba­tions, because @l actually affects the interevent times, 
as well as the type of events. A perturbation in 01 is propagated throughout the timing of the system 
according to the following rules: PROPAGATION RULES: .~:=~+$ife~=~; dTl f+=~; ~:=wl d@I  reset all 
~ := O at regenerative point  (when e$# 4Vj); where dTj/d61 is a variable introduced to track the (relative) 
perturbations in timing at component j (at epoch t~).The first rule implements the propagation of a perturbation 
generated in the service time which generates the ith replacement epoch. The second rule implements the 
propagation of the generating compo­nent to all other components which are also replaced at the ith replacement 
epoch. The last rule is imple­mented because at a regenerative point, the second rule implies that every 
component will get the same perturbation, and hence all differences are O; for our purposes the difference 
is all that matters, so without loss of generality, we can reset all counters to O. WJe first define 
 where we define Ii = O for the first two AO1 cases, and Ii = 1 for the last two Af71 cases, with A6~ 
defined as the corresponding finite perturbation. Thus, this indicator function corresponds to the first 
and third situations in Figure 1 when there is the possibility of a switch in the component which generates 
the (i+ l)th replacement epoch. We translate the possibilities for Adl discussed above into the following 
four probabilities: e~+ [@l] = y,e~+l[~l + AL91] = @ : P(v:+7 A6:<OZIV1+T;>6Z, A&#38; >O); ~~tl[~l] =

when Y~ > 02, the expected contribution due to the change turns out to be zero by symmetry. Thus, we 
can just consider the case Y; s 6 2, which must be added into the con­ditional distribution for ri+l, 
yielding the conditional rate, given Y; > 62, Y; ~ 92: P(vj+T A6j s %]v:+r >&#38;, A6~ < O) lim A@I+O

For the fourth case, we again can further subdi­vide the cases based on I{Y~ > 02}, because this time 
when Y: s 02, the expected contribution due to the change turns out to be zero by symmetry. Thus, we 
can just consider the case Y: > 62, which must be added into the conditional distribution for r,+l, yielding 
the conditional rate, given Y~ s $2, Y: >6 2: if (&#38; ~ 62 v; < ~i! &#38;91 f(v: +02 v}) _dif~  F(V$

the derivation of the event ex­change rate term in Equation (1), we now turn to the change in the performance 
measure due to the event exchange. We need to construct two sample paths which represent the limit in 
which the exchange oc­curs, one in which the events just miss exchang­ing and the other in which the 
events ~ust make exchanging. The paths are identical to the nominal (original) path up to the ith replacement 
epoch with the following changes at the (i + l)st replacement epoch (where we represent the newly constructed 
paths with a tilde representation), corresponding to each of the four previous cases: Case 1. fi~+l = 
v; +f~, if e~+l = ~, -2+1 Vj = O, ifj=*ore~+l=~, j# , PP1 : ZY+l = 62, DNP1 : fi~+l = O, DNPI _ CR;9;+51

Vj = 0, ifj=*ore~+l=~, pp4 : fi:+l = (), DNP4 : C$+l = o, DNP4 9r+q4 9i+l = +CR; Case 5 is identical 
to Case 1. We note further that for Cases 3 and 4, no additional work need be done, because other than 
the cost difference at ti+l, the two paths PP and DNP are identical; finally, Case 2 is similar to the 
negative of Case 1, except that the upper bound q, is used instead of the lower bound &#38;i. Defining 
the indicator function to be O if the index - does not exist, our final estimators are given by the following: 
~ = ~I{&#38; <%-v! <?,,%> O} i=l  3 SPECIAL CASES The obvious way to estimate (~~P(i) ~~~P( ) ) is 
to simulate from the (i+ l)st replacement epoch to the nth replacement epoch for each of the two paths, 
take the difference, and add the appropriate (g~+~ 9~+~P ) term. It is clear that this could potentially 
entail a substantial number of sub-simulations, and probably not computationally practical. For the cases 
of N=2 and $2=0, we can derive efficient estimators, which we discuss in this section. If 02=0, then 
all components would always be si­multaneously replaced, so in essence the system acts as a single component 
with the distribution being the minimum of all service times. It should be clear that for our performance 
measure the derivative with respect to 01 is O, and our estimator will also give this, since every replacement 
epoch is a regenerative point and hence db~ /dO1 = O always. Although the derivative with respect to 
02 is non-zero, since ev­ery replacement epoch is regenerative, the quantity (z:p[i~ -Z$?NP( J ) always 
corresponds to a regener­ative starting point, and hence can be very efficiently estimated using the 
sample path itself without need for additional simulation. For 02 # O, we also have simplification for 
N=2 and large n, because the term (~~p(i) ~~~p( ) ) will no longer depend on various ages at ti,simply 
because there won t be any other components besides the two involved in the potential event exchange. 
Case 1: -2+1 _ V* o, PP1 : it+l =G%, DiVPl :i+l =O; Case 2 . -;+1 _ V* o, PP1 : -i+l = o, DNPI : ti~+l 
= 62; v+ i.e, taking * as component 1, DNP 1 is the path starting with ages (O, O) (regenerative point), 
whereas PP1 is the path starting with ages (O, L%), and DNP2 and PP2 simply correspond to the reverse 
of this. Recall that if the - needed for the first and fourth cases are missing, then there is no contribution 
for that replacement epoch. When there are only two components, the - component if it exists will correspond 
to the + component, which is simply the component other than the * component, and we also have &#38; 
= 192 v:, rl~ = Y! z/. In addi­tion, the first condition in the indicator functions will automatically 
be satisfied. These results simplify the estimators given by Equations (2) and (3). Furthermore, for 
large n, we get the following sim­plification by using the construction for DNP and state (0,62) (0,0) 
I &#38; nn I DNP + PP Figure 3: Sample Path Used to Construct DNP and PP PP depicted in Figure 3 (Case 
1): ~PP _ ~DNP ~ L::fi ~:Np  9i ---9i -s + n+ni=l Z=ii = ~($gi+~g )-%gi = 4) +&#38;gz-n n) Because 
this quantity is independent of i, it can be taken outside the summation in the expressions for the estimators, 
and estimated completely indepen­dently (e.g., (off-line ) from the rest of the estima­ tor, where h 
and ~~=1 gi are the quantities which need to be estimated. They can be efficiently esti­mated by simply 
running one additional (relatively very short) simulation which starts from the initial condition with 
ages (O, 192) and ends when it first hits the regenerative point of both components being re­ placed. 
Of course, to get better estimates, this can be done for multiple replications. Example: For illustrative 
purposes, we now con­ sider an example for the N = 2 case to see the re­ sulting simplifications from 
the preceding analysis. If the components have uniformly distributed lifetimes, with 01 as the upper 
bound, then we have the follow­ ing for the hazard-rate-like functions that, appear in the estimators: 
f(v: + (?2 2/}) 1 J (v$, +qi) ~(~~ +02 vj) = mW j.,h 24 +vj.) 92 (recall that Y: = Y~, if - exists, 
where + will correspond to the component other than * ), and the estimators given by Equations (2) and 
(3) become the following easy to implement and computationally efficient estimators: Fu, Hu, * = (z= 
-EDNP-c~/n) x where ~~ = min(Y~, L91 v~+v~) and (~Pp ~D~p) is given by Equation (4). CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 Threshold parameters arise frequently in the opti­mizat ion of discrete-event systems, so the availability 
y of gradient estimates is an important area of research. As noted in the introduction, perturbation 
analysis is a gradient estimation technique which has been ap­plied to a wide variety of these types 
of problems. We have shown that it is possible to derive gradient esti­mates for replacement problems 
in maintenance the­ory; however, the estimators we have derived here do not appear to be computationally 
efficient except for the special cases N = 2 or 192= O, which are of limited practical use. The estimation 
of (~SP(i) ~~~p(i) ) requires in general on the order of one separate sub­simulation for each replacement 
epoch, so there might be on the order of n extra sub-simulations required per replication, though many 
of them would be quite short. For the special cases, this extra simulation is eliminated. An alternative 
approach which might be more successful for this problem is the standard clock approach (see, e.g., Vakili 
1991). Proofs for unbi­asedness of the gradient estimators derived here have been omitted, but as is 
usual for perturbation analy­sis estimators, the key tool would be the dominated convergence theorem, 
which allows the interchange of derivative (limit ) and expectation (integral); such a proof would proceed 
along lines similar to the ones in Fu and Hu (1992), though as we noted already, this simple system does 
not satisfy some of the assump­tions usually given for a GSMP framework. and Shi Finally we note that 
gradient estimation techniques from the discrete-event simulation community need not be restricted to 
the traditional models of oper­at ions research such as queueing, inventory, and re­liability. Another 
application to a threshold-like pa­rameter is considered in Fu and Hu (1993), in which is derived an 
efficient unbiased estimator (in contrast to the problem studied here, requiring only one ex­tra short 
simulation per replication) for the gradi­ent of an American call option price with respect to its early 
exercise threshold at an ex-dividend point. It is then demonstrated how this gradient estimator can be 
used to do option pricing for American-style (where early exercise is possible) options, for which heretofore 
the finance community had not considered Monte Carlo simulation as a viable alternative. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
