Troy,  Abstract A class of univariate polynomials is defined which make the Berlekamp-Hensel factorization 
algorithm take an exponential amount of time. The class contains as subclasses the Swinnerton-Dyer polynomials 
discussed by Berlekamp and a subset of the oyclotomic polynomials. Aside from shed- ding light on the 
complexity of polynomial factorization this class is also useful in testing implementations of the 
Berlekamp- Hensel and related algorithms. i. Introduction and Summary of Results This paper generalizes 
a class of univariate polynomials with integral co- efficients attributed to H.P.F. Swinnerton-Dyer by 
E.R. Berlekamp [BERL70, p733]. We use Galois theoretical methods to prove their properties of interest. 
 These polynomials are of particular  interest for the Berlekamp-Hensel factori- zation algorithm [KNUDSI, 
p433], which determines factors modulo p and lifts them to find the integral factors of a polyno- 
mial. Because the polynomials in the class we will define are irreducible over the integers but have 
a large number of factors modulo p for every prime p, the  Berlekamp-Hensel algorithm behaves badly 
 on them: In determining their irreducibili- ty it needs a number of operations that is  exponential 
in the degree and coefficient lengths of the polynomials. This was also true for the Swinnerton-Dyer 
polynomials,  This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant # MCS-7909158.

contains subclasses that, unlike the Swin- newton-Dyer polynomials would make an alternative algorithm 
(see Section 4) remain super-polynomial in its computing time. Let n be a positive integer and let 
r be an integer >_ 2. By ~r we denote exp(2~i/r), the first primitive r-th root of unity. Let PI''':'Pn 
be n distinct positive prime numbers. By f (x) r;Pi'''" 'Pn we denote the monic univariate polynomial

is a prime number the following will be shown: If the coefficients of f are r;Pl'''" 'Pn projected into 
a field of residues modulo any prime number q, henceforth denoted by Zq, the image polynomials fr;Pl,...,p 
n (mod q) factor into irreducible polynomials over Z which have degree at most r. q  If r = 2 this 
construction gives a slightly simpler version of the Swinnerton- Dyer polynomials which treat /-i as 
an additional prime number. But our Galois theoretical proofs can be easily extended to yield this special 
case. The condition of r being a prime num- ber is not crucial for the unpleasant running time behavior 
for the factoriza- tion of these polynomials. For composite r the degrees of the irreducible factors 
in the modular domain are then bounded by 2 r (we will actually prove a somewhat  better bound). 
A modified version of these polyno-  188 Proceedings of the 1981 ACM Symposium A Generalized Class of

of its closely related properties : By fr;Pl'''''Pn we denotei0 theilPOlynomial whose roots are ~r

com- mon divisor of i 0 and r is i. Again all fr;Pl,. "''pn are integer polynomials which factor modulo 
any prime q into polynomials whose degrees are bounded as for fr;Pl,...,p n. If r is 2, 4, 6 or an 
odd integer t f* is r;Pl,-..,P n also irreducible over the integers. Other- wise ~lese polynomials may 
be reducible but we can guarantee that all factors over the integers are of degree at least 2r n. If 
n=0 ' f*r;Z are the cyclotomic poly- nomials ~r(X). We will show that for certain composite r the maximum 
degree of factors in any residue field implies a super-polynomial running time for the Berlekamp-Hensel 
factorization algorithm This fact is discussed in [MUSD75, p302]. D. Knuth [KNUD81, p437] uses Berlekamp's 
algorithm to prove the modular factoriza- tion property for ~8" In section 2 we introduce the number 
theory and Galois theory required to prove our main theorems in section 3. In section 4 we give examples 
of these polynomials and additionally analyze the computing time required to factor them. We conclude 
in section 5 with a recap of the Galois theoretical considerations underlying our results. Notation: 
By Z we denote the integers and by Q the rational numbers. 2. Number Theoretical and Galois Theoreti- 
ca l Back@round Let r be an integer > 2. By U we --r  denote the set of residues modulo r which are 
relatively prime to r. This set forms a group under multiplication modulo r and there exists a minimal 
non-negative integer l(r) such that for each s e U :sZ(r)---1 r (mod r). l(r) is called the minimum 
uni- versal exponent modulo r. It is known (see [KNUDSi, plg]) that X(2) = i, ~(4) = 2, I(2 e) = 2 ~-2 
for e>3 c¢0 ~l q C~n) i(2 ql "'~ n = icm(Z(2e0)'~(ql el)' '''#(qn n)) where the qi are distinct prime 
numbers, is Euler's totient function and icm means the least common multiple. Let Pi be the i-th consecutive 
prime number. As a con- sequence of Tchebycheff's theorem Pi < 2i for all i > 1 [SIEW64, p138]. Actually 
Pi is of order O(i log i) [HAWR79, pl0] but in the following lemma we only need the previous estimate 
: Lemma i: Let j be a fixed integer > 2. Then there are infinitely many positive integers m (namely 
the product of the first k odd prime numbers with k sufficiently large) such that ~(m)/~(m) > (log2(~(m)))J 
 Proof: Let m = p2...pk. Then ~ (m) = (P2-1)... (Pk-l) < 2 k(k+l)/2 by the above estimate for Pi" Therefore 
(log 2 (~ (m))) j < k 2j. Also l(m) = icm(P2-1,..., Pk-l) < 2(P2-i)/2 "'" (Pk-l)/2 = 22-k ~(m). Hence 
 (m)/Z(m)> 2 k-2 > k 2j for k chosen large enough. Therefore for all sufficiently large k: ~(m)/Z(m) 
> (log2(#(m)))J. 0 In the proof of theorem 2 below we will make use of the fact that for every prime 
number r and for all s ~ Ur-{1}: (sr-l-l)/(s-l) is a multiple of r. This follows from the Euler theorem 
( a ~ (b) ---1 (mod b) for (a,b) = 1 ) and the fact that r is a prime number. In order to treat composite 
r we generalize this matter : Lemma 2 : Let r be a positive composite integer. By n (r) we denote 
the minimum exponent such that for each s e Ur-{l}: (sn(r)-l)/(s-l) is divisible by r. Then n (r) < 
r l(r). In fact, n (r) < dl(r) where-d = icm({(s-l,r) : s e Ur-{l}}). Proof: Since for any s, (s-l,r) 
divides r so must d and therefore d < r. We claim that (sdZ(r)-l) / (s-l) is a multiple of r: To prove 
this we first factor sdl(r)-i as (s~ (r)_l) (s (d-l) ~(r) +s (d-2) X (r) +...+i) . Now the left factor 
is a multiple of r. It is therefore sufficient to show that the right factor is a multiple of d since 
that means it can absorb any factor of r in s-i (by definition of d). But s kZ(r) (sZ(r)) k -= 1 (rood 
d) for 0 < k < d-i since d divides r and thus (s(d-l)Z(rJ+'''+l)~'~ =- d-I =-0 (mod d), as required. 
Therefore 189 A Genera/ized Class of Polynomials That Are Hard to Factor q(r) < d~(r) < rl(r). At 
this point the question arises what the actual value of q(r) is. %~e have not found an explicit formula. 
Theorem 2 could be improved if we knew that the q value of a divisor of r is bounded by q (r). (This 
is true for the function ~.) The following table indicates for some r t/le values of q(r) and its bounds 
from lemma 2: Let f and g be two m~Dnic polynomials whose coefficients lie in some integral domain R. 
Let ei' 1 < i < deg(f) and Bj, 1 < j < deg(g) denote their roots respec- tively? Since the polynomial

ties of the cyclotomic polynomials later and shall mention them now: Let r be an integer _> 2 and let 
~r be a primitive r-th root of unity. There always exist ~(r) distinct primitive r-th roots of unity 
in an extension field of Q or Zq provided that q is a prime number not dividing r. They are the powers 
of ~r whose exponents are relatively prime to r. Then r i ~r(X ) = ~ (x_~ r ) = ~ (xd_l) ~(r/d) i=l 
d I r (i , r) =i  denotes the r-th cyclotomic polynomial which has all integer coefficients (or their 
residues modulo q if the ground field is Zq) . By dlr we mean that d is a divisor of r and ~ denotes 
the Moebius function. (See lYdIA53, pl12].) If ~r = exp(2zi/r) (i.e. the ground field is Q) then ~ 
is irreducible over Z r [VeWA53 , p162] .  Lemma 3: Let q be a prime number and let m and r be positive 
integers such that r is relatively prime to q. Then ~r m (x) E ~r(X) ~(qm) (mod q). q  Proof: First 
we notice the fact that for any integral polynomial f and any integer i i  i > 0: f(x q ) £ f(x) q 
(rood q). Then by using the formulas for the cyolotomic polynomials with the Moebius function given 
above the stated congruence can be easily shown. [] By the Galois group of a polynomial we mean the 
automorphism group of its splitting field over the field of its co- efficients. Then the Galois group 
of r over Q is isomorphic to U r under multipli- cation modulo r [V~A53, p162]. is symmetric in both 
the ~i and the 8 i it follows from the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions [VdWA53, p79] that 
its coefficients also lie in R. There is a resultant method which makes it possible to compute this polynomial 
by operations in R: Lemma 4: Let R be an integral domain and let f and g be monic polynomials in R[x]. 
Then (_l)deg(f) deg(g) res (f(x-y),g(y))  Y is a menic polynomial in R[x] of degree deg(f).deg(g) whose 
roots are ~i+Bi where e i (I < i < deg(f)) are the roots of f and Bj (i _< j < deg(g)) are the roots 
of g. By res we mean the resultant with respect to Y the indeterminate y (see [VdWA53, p84]). Proof: 
See [LOOS73]. [] The next two lemmas will help explain why our polynomials split into so many factors 
modulo any prime number. First we show what happens to the Galois group when an integral polynomial is 
projected to a polynomial over a residue field. Lemma 5: Let f be a monic separable poly- no--in Z[x] 
and let f £ Z [x] be its q natural projection modulo a prime number q. If f is separable (over Zq) the 
Galois group of ~ over Z is a subgroup (as a per- mutation group onqthe suitably arranged roots) of 
the Galois group of f over Q. Proof: See [VdWA53, p190]. [] The above lemma has been generalized by 
[ZASH79] for the case in which f is not separable. But, f is inseparable only if q divides the discriminant 
of f, and one must avoid those primes in order to be able to perform the Hensel factor lifting algorithm. 
 Lemma 6: Let f e Z [x], q being prime. q Assume that all elements of the Galois group (as permutations 
on the distinct roots of ~) are written as products of dis- joint cycles. Then ~ does not contain an 
irreducible factor of degree higher than the length of the longest cycle. Proof: This follows immediately 
from the 190 A Generalized Class of Polynomials That Are Hard to Factor statement made about the generating 
element of the Galois group of T in [VdWA53, pl91] or likewise from theorem 14 in [GAAL73, p230]. [3 
The next two lemmas constitute the key for our irreducibility proofs. By [K:F] we denote the degree 
of a field K over a subfield F and by F(81,...,0n) we denote the field F extended by the elements 91 
, .. ,O n Lemma 7: Let r be an integer > 2, prz~ve r-th root of unity,-and Erleta Pl'''" 'Pn be distinct 
positive primes: a) [O (~Pl .... '~Pn ) :Q] = rn" b) If r > 3 then 2r n _~ [e(Er,~Pl ..... ~pn) : 
Q] < ~(r) r n. c) If r is odd or 2, 4, or 6 then [Q(~r,~Pl .... ,~pn ) :e] = ~(r) r n.  Proof: Partial 
statements of this lemma are usually shown by Kummerian theory [LANG71, p218]. Elementary proofs of 
part a) appear in [BESI40] and [RICI74], of part c) for odd r in [CAVB68, p50] and [RICI74]. Part b) 
follows immediately from part a) and the fact that for r > 3 every ~r is a non-real algebraic number 
of degree ~(r). If r = 2 part c) is the same as part a). For r=4 or 6 we combine part b) and the fact 
that both ~(4) and ~(6) are 2. [] Notice that part c) may not hold for even r >_ 8 depending on what 
primes Pi''""' Pn are chosen. Counterexamples may be con- structed using the fact that /2 e Q(E8 ) 
or /5 ~ Q(EI0 ) etc. Lemma 8: Let r be an integer > 2, ~r a primitive r-th root of unity, and let 
Pi' """ 'Pn be distinct prime numbers. Then ~Pn is not an element of the field Q (~r' %1 ..... ~Pn-i 
)" Proof: If r is 2 the fact follows from part a)~ lemma 8. By F k we denote the field O(Er,~Pl ..... 
~pk ) with 1 < k < n. Now assume that r is > 3 and ~Pn e Fn_ 1 which implies that F n = Fn_ I. Applying 
part b) of lemma 8 we get 2r n < [Fn:Q] = [Fn_i:Q] < ~(r) r n-l, which is impossible. 3. Main Results 
 Theorem i: Let r be an integer > 2 and let Pl"''Pn be distinct prime numbers. Then f and f have integer 
 r;Pl"'" 'Pn r;Pl"'" 'Pn coefficients and the following irreduci- bility conditions hold: a) f is irreducible 
over the r;Pl'''" 'Pn integers and each irreducible factor of , f over the integers with r > 3 r;Pl'" 
" " 'Pn has degree at least 2r n. * b) If r = 2, 4, 6 or odd then f r;Pl'" " " 'Pn  is irreducible. 
 Proof: Using lemma 4 inductively we see that the coefficients of fr;Pl,... 'Pn and f are integers and 
that their r;Pl"'" 'Pn degrees are r n and ~(r)r n respectively. (Notice that ~ has integer coefficients 
 r as mentioned in section i. ) First we prove bY induction that ~Pl +'" "+ ~Pn is a primi- tive element 
of Q(~Pi' .... ~Pn )" We make use of the construction of a primitive element given in [VdWA53, p126] 
: Let el = ~Pl +'" "+ ~Pn-I and e 2, ..., ern_l be the remaining roots of fr;Pl,... 'Pn-l" By the 
induction hypothesis Q(c~ I) = Q(~Pi"'"' ~Pn_l ) . The minimal polynomial of ~i is of n-i degree [Q(el 
) :Q] which is r by lemma 7. Therefore f is the minimal r;Pl'" " " 'Pn-i polynomial. Let 81 = ~Pn' 
82"'"' 8r be the roots of x r which is irreducible by -Pn Eisenstein's criterion. Then el+81 is a primitive 
element of Q(~i,Bi) = Q(~Pi"'"' ~pn ) provided that ~i+81 ~ ~i+8~ J for 1 <_ i < r n-I and 1 < j < r. 
For the sake of ~ontradiction assume that this condition cannot be achieved, namely there exist an i 
and a j > 1 such that ~l-CCi = 81-~ ~. Since 8j = ~rk ~Pn for some positive kJ < r it follows that el-ei 
= ~Pn (l-~kr) and therefore ~Pn = (el-ei) / (l-~kr) which is an element of Q(~r' ~Pl .... , ~Pn_l ) 
, in contradiction to lemma 8. Noticing that is irreducible we can prove in exactly r the same way that 
~r + ~Pl +" " "+ ~Pn-is a primitive element of Q(~r' ~Pl .... ' ~Pn )" However, the ei will be the roots 
of an irreducible factor of f r;Pl'''''Pn-l" We now conclude that the minimal polyno- 191 A Generalized 
Class of Polynomials That Are Hard to Factor mials of these primitive elements are of the same degree 
as the field extensions obtained by adjoining them to the rationals which we know by lemma 7, part a) 
and c). Therefore f and, in the case r;Pl'''" 'Pn that r = 2, 4, 6 or an odd integer, , f are these 
minimal polynomials r;Pl'''" 'Pn and hence must be irreducible. All irre- , ducible factors of f have 
degree r;Pl'''" 'Pn at least 2r n because all roots are primi- tive elements by the argument above and 
the lower bound of the corresponding_ field extension is known from lemma 7b). U Theorem 2: Let r be 
an integer > 2 and let Pi'""" 'Pn be prime numbers. For any prime number q the following factorization 
prop- erties hold for the projected polynomials f (rood q) and f r;Pl'''" 'Pn r;Pl'''''Pn (rood q) 
: a) The maximum degree of any irreducible factor of both polynomials over the resi- due field modulo 
q is at most r~(r). Special case: If r is a prime number the maximum degree is r. b) If n = 0 then the 
maximum degree of an irreducible factor of f~;@ (mod q) = Tr (mod q) is X(r). Proof : a~ first show 
that the length of the longest cycle in any permutation of the Galois group of fr;Pl ' 'Pn or f* "" 
r;Pl'''" 'Pn  is at most max(r,q(r)) , where n (r) is as defined in lemma 2. Let o be an automor- phism 
on Q(~r' ~Pi' "'"' ~Pn )" As such it has to map the roots of the polynomials r r  and x -Pi into roots 
of the same polyno- mials. In particular o (~r) = Cr sO where Cr is a primitive r-th root of unity 
and sG is relatively prime to r. Also o (~pi) = Cr mi ~Pi' where the m i depend also on o (1 < i < 
n). We now distinguish two cases: Case i: s = i. O (r) ~ Applying a r times we get o ( Pi ) = Pi 
for all 1 < i < n and therefore o (r) maps each root ~f f-~;Pl'r 'Pn and f* "" r;Pl'''" 'Pn  onto itself 
which is to say that the per- mutation corresponding to a has cycles of length at most r. Case 2: s 
O > i. n (r) ~ 1 By lemma 2 we know that both s o n (r) i)  (mod r) and (s o -/ (so-l) ~ 0 (rood r). 
 A short computation shows that then O (q (r)) (~r) = ~r and o (q (r)) (~pi) = ~Pi for all 1 < i < 
n. Therefore the cycle lengths of--the--permutation corresponding to o are at most q (r). Cases 1 and 
2 together prove the statement made initially. If the image polynomials are separable we are finished 
by virtue of the lemmas 2, 5 and 6. But we can repeat the above arguments for automorphisms on the splitting 
field of f (mod q) itself because as we r;Pl'''" 'Pn mentioned before the properties of r-th roots of 
unity carry over for ground fields of characteristic q, provided that q does not divide r. Finally let 
qm be the highest power of q dividing r. By using the identity introduced in the proof of lemma 3 and 
by using lemma 3 itself we can determine the multiplicities of the roots of ~r (mod q) r (mod q) (which 
lie in some Galois  and x -Pi field). Therefore f E r;Pl'" " " 'Pn (mod q) and  ( fr m qZmq /q ;Pl'" 
' " 'Pn ) f* _= (f* ~(qm) qmn r;Pl'" " " 'Pn r/qm;Pl .... 'Pn ) (med q). It follows from the formula 
for X given at the beginning of section 2 that X(r/q m) divides X(r). Then by lemma 2 and the already 
proven theorem for the case that q does not divide r we conclude that the maximum degree in this case 
is r/q m X (r/q m) < rX(r). If r is a prime number the above proof together with the remark made above 
lemma 2 actually gives the degree bound r. b) If Tr (rood q) is separable we know its Galois group 
to be a subgroup of U r under multiplication modulo r. (This by lemma 5 but one may verify it directly.) 
The definition of X and lemma 6 then lead to the statement. If ~ (rood q) is insepar- r able q necessarily 
divides r. Again putting together the above, lemma 3 and the fact that X(r/q m) divides X(r) proves 
 the theorem for this case. [] In many cases the above arguments re- veal that the bound rX(r) is too 
pessimis- tic: If the image polynomial is separable or more generally if q does not divide r we have 
proven that the bound max(r,q (r)) suffices which may be considerably smaller than rX(r) (see table 1 
below lemma 2). If q divides r a bound is rX(r)/q. 4. Computational Consideratiqns One may use lemma 
4 in connection with a method to compute cyclotomic polynomials [KNUD01, p440] to actually generate 
sample polynomials. In producing some of the following examples we used the computer 192 A Generalized

  Table 2 illustrates very well our results: All but polynomial (3) are irre- ducible over the integers. 
Since J2 c Q(~8 ) we also know that (3) must be com- posite. All the polynomials (1)-(9) factor in any 
modular field into polynomials of smaller degrees and make excellent test cases for implementations of 
the Berlekamp- Hensel factorization algorithm. E.g. polynomial (7) factors mod 7: (x3+x2+4x+3) (x3+2x2+5x+5) 
 (x3+2x2+4x+2) (x3+x2+3x÷5) (x3+2x2+2x+3) (x3+x2+x+2) mod 1979: (x2+1823x+1632) (x2+85x+6) (x2+828x+749) 
(x2+1069x+6) (x2+1069x+749) (x2+1069x+1632 (x2+1069x+878) (x2+85x+1744) (x2+828x+1744). The Berlekamp-Hensel 
factorization algorithm contains the following "bottle- neck" [KNUD81, p434]: If f is a polynomial of 
degree k and splits in a chosen residue field into j irreducible factors then one must perform at least 
2J-l-i trial divi- sions to prove its irreducibility over the integers. If we assume that r is kept 
fixed and that pl,...,pn are the first n prime num- bers we obtain for fr;pl,...,p n that k=r n and 
j ~ rn/rl (r) ~ rn-2? Thus at least 0(2 k) factor combinations must be tested. As we will show below 
the lengths of the coefficients under these assumptions are of magnitude O(k log log(k)) Hence the worst 
case time complexity of the Berlekamp-Hensel algorithm is indeed an exponential function in the degree 
and coefficient lengths of its inputs. Since the degrees of all irreducible factors of f are independent 
of n the r;Pl,-..,P n modifications of this algorithm suggested in [KNUD81, p434] do not eliminate the 
exponential running time behavior. However, additional possibilities have arisen: New probabilistic 
algorithms fac- tor polynomials over large modular fields sufficiently fast (see [RABM80]). There- fore 
the Hensel factor lifting step can be avoided and inseparable modular factor- izations used. It may then 
happen that there occur only a few distinct factors with high multiplicities from which, for example, 
certain irreducibility criteria can be inferred. (Cf. exercise 19 in [KNUD81, p626].) Unfortunately, 
these considerations are not applicable for the cyclotomic polynomials ~m with m=P2. "'Pk as in lemma 
 1 such that ~(m)/l(m) > (log ~(m)) 4. Then ~m (mod q) is inseparable only if q I m i.e. q=Pi for some 
i. Generally q is still too small to justify the omission of the Hensel lifting procedure Using lemma 
3 and the estimate for Pi above lemma 1 we can also show that ~m (mod q) has at least O((log ~(m))2) 
distinct factors which would make the factor combination step s uperpolynomial. Finally we establish 
certain bounds for the coefficients of our polynomials when the primes Pi are as small as pos- sible. 
For a polynomial f, let norm(f) denote the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of f. Theorem

inequality for the norm immediately establishes part a). b) Every root of T has absolute value 1 m 
and hence norm (~m) < (l+l) ~(m) [] 5. Remarks By way of summary, we attempt to abstract from our arguments 
about our class of polynomials an "intuitive" ex- planation of their unusual factorization behavior. 
Their irreducibility over the integers seems quite plausible because a set of roots of powers of primes 
is lin- early independent over the field of rational numbers. However, their Galois groups have very 
short cycle lengths and hence a modular projection will preserve very little structure of these groups. 
Therefore it seems that the extreme "compression" of the Galois groups by taking the remainders is to 
be blamed for the abundance of factors we then get. The average behavior of the Berlekamp- Hensel algorithm 
is quite well understood [COLG79]. But the density theorems used for its analysis degenerate in our 
case. Peter Weinberger's irreducibility criterion is based on the correctness of the Gener- alized Riemann 
Hypothesis and may consti- tute an algorithm for testing irreducibil- ity in polynomial time (see [KNUDSi, 
p632]). However, no polynomial time algorithm is known which computes the factors of reducible polynomials 
such as  f8;2,3,... 'Pn" RE FE RENCE S <RefA>[BERL70] E. R. Berlekamp, Factoring poly- nomials over large
