ABSTRACT A retrial queueing system with two types of customers and with feed back is considered. Type 
1 customers arrive in batches of size k with probability ck and type 2 customers arrive singly according 
to two Poisson processes with rates 8 .1 c¯= .1 kck and .2 respectively. Service time distri­ k=1 butions 
are di.erent for both type of customers. If arriving customers are blocked due to server being busy, 
type 1 cus­tomers are queued in a priority queue of in.nite capacity, while type 2 customers enter into 
a retrial group in order to seek service again after a random amount of time. For this system the joint 
distribution of the number of customers in the priority queue and in the retrial group is obtained in 
closed form. Some operating characteristics are derived and a numerical study is also carried out. Categories

retrial queueing theory. For detailed survey one can see Choi and Chang (1999), Yang and Tem­pleton (1987) 
and Falin (1992). Choi and Park (1990) in­vestigated an M/G/1 retrial queue with two types of cus­tomers 
in which the service time distribution for both types Permission to make digital or hard copies of all

r.kalyan24@rediff.com of customers is the same. Falin et.al(1993) investigated a similar model, in which 
they assumed di.erent service time distributions for the two types of customers. In 1995, Choi et.al, 
studied an M/G/1 retrial queueing model with two types of customers and .nite capacity. Kalyanaraman 
and Srinivasan (2004), studied an M/G/1 retrial queue with ge­ometric loss and with type I batch arrivals 
and type II single arrivals. In this paper we deal with a feed back retrial queue with two types of customers, 
in which type 1 arrivals are in batches and type 2 arrivals are in singles. The phenomenon of feed back 
in retrial queueing systems occur in many prac­tical situations like telecommunication systems, where 
failed messages to a destination are sent again and again until it reaches the destination. In section 
2, we describe the system with stability condition and notation. In section 3, we ob­tain the joint probability 
generating function for the number of customers in the priority queue and in the retrial group when server 
is busy as well as idle.The expressions for some operating characteristics are derived in section 4 and 
some particular models are deduced in section 5. A numerical study is carried out in section 6.  2. 
THE MODEL We consider a retrial queueing system with two types of customers, type 1 and type 2 respectively. 
Type 1 arrivals occur in batches of size k with probability ck and type 2 cus­tomers arrive singly, according 
to two Poisson processes with 8 rates .1c¯where ¯c = kck and .2 respectively. If a type 2 k=1 customer, 
upon arrival .nds the server busy, he enters in to an orbit in order to seek service again after a random 
amount of time. He persists this way until he is eventually served. All the customers in the retrial 
group behave independent of each other. The retrial time is exponentially distributed 1 with mean and 
is independent of all other stochastic pro­ a cesses involved in the system. The linear retrial rate 
policy is used in the analysis. Type 1 customers are queued in a priority queue of in­.nite capacity 
after blocking, when the server is busy. As soon as the server is free,the customer at the head of the 
priority queue is served, and the customers in the retrial group will be served only if there are no 
calls from the prior­ity queue. Therefore, type 1 customers have non-preemptive priority over type 2 
customers. The service time distributions of the two types of cus-tomers are independent and non-identical. 
In order to use the supplementary variable technique, the residual service time of a customer in service 
is taken as the supplementary variable. The service time density functions are bi(x),i = 8 1,2.Let C(z)= 
ck z k be the generating function of batch k=1 ' size distribution, and ¯c= C(1),be the mean batch size. 
Let 8 Bk *(s)= e -sxbk (x)dx,k =1,2 denote the Laplace trans­ 0  3. THEJOINTDISTRIBUTIONOFTHE NUMBER 
OF CUSTOMERS IN THE PRIORITY QUEUE AND IN THE RETRIAL GROUP We derive the joint distribution of the number 
of cus­tomers in the priority queue and in the retrial group in the study state. Usual argument leads 
to the following di.erential-di.erence equations. form of the service time distributions. The priority 
customer who has just received service de­parts the system with probability 1 -d1 or returns to the head 
of the priority queue for more service with probability d1. A non-priority customer who has received 
service leaves the system with probability 1-d2 or rejoins the retrial group with probability d2 . Using 
the mean drift argument of Falin (1984), we can show that the system is stable if .1 + .2 < 1where .1

with that of Choi and Park (1990). (ii) When B1(x)= B2(x)= B(x); d1 = d2 =0; .1 =0, the system coincides 
with that of Falin and Temple­ton(1997).  (iii) When d1 = d2 =0, the system coincides with that of Srinivasan 
(2004).  6. NUMERICAL STUDY In this section we analyze the operating characteristics of the system studied 
in this paper by assigning particu­lar values to the parameters corresponding to type 2 arrival rate, 
service rate, feedback probabilities, retrial rate and mean batch size and by varying the rate of type 
1 arrival. The corresponding mean values of the priority queue (Np ) and the orbit (Nr ) are given in 
.gure 6.1 (Type 2 arrival rate 0.1) and .gure 6.2 (Type 2 arrival rate 0.15). From the .gures it is clear 
that the mean value increases as the ar­rival rate increases. In .gures 6.3 and 6.4, the retrial rate 
is varied by .xing Type 1 arrival rate at 0.22 and 0.23 respec-tively. Here also the graphs represent 
the mean number of customers in the priority queue and orbit. The .gures show that in both the cases 
the mean orbit size decreases whereas the mean size of the priority queue is almost a constant for increasing 
values of retrial rate.   Figure 6. 4: Retrial rate versus the mean number of customers  7. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
