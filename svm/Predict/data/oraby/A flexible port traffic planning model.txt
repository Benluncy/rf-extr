 A FLEXIBLE PORT TRAFFIC PLANNING MODEL Randall R. Gibson Beth C. Carpenter Automation Associates, Incorporated 
512 Via de la Vane, Suite 209 Solana Beach, California 92075 ABSTRACT This paper reports on a comprehensive 
simulation model developed to assist in future growth planning for the Port of Long Beach, California. 
The model simulates truck, auto, and rail traffic in a single model, using techniques developed to control 
complexity and run time, allowing the model to be implemented on a 386 class PC. Traditional traffic 
modeling practices (based on queuing models from traffic flow and capacity research reports) were integrated 
with discrete modeling techniques, resulting in a hybrid model that tracks individual vehicles, yet produces 
system wide performance measures consistent with generally accepted traffic flow modeling and reporting 
practices. 1 INTRODUCTION The original concept for the model developed out of the observation that managing 
port growth in times of increasing urbanization and heightened environmental awareness is perhaps the 
greatest challenge facing ports today . There are few cases more illustrative of this than the Port of 
Long Beach in California. An early advocate of containerization, Long Beach had become one of the world 
s premier ports by the 1980 s, forming with the adjacent Port of Los Angeles the largest and most diversified 
cargo handling complex in North America. Together, these ports anticipate a doubling of cargo volumes 
in the next two decades. In early 1990, the Port Authority in Long Beach faced unique problems of multiple 
challenges: managing the continuing cargo Scott P. Seeburger Frederic R. Harris, Incorporated 6300 Northeast 
First Avenue Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33334 growth while at the same time planning for city mandated 
truck restrictions during rush hours, and additional traffic from a new Disney theme park complex proposed 
for the current location of the Queen Mary (situated adjacent one of the major port access routes). The 
limited access to the Port (bounded by water on three sides) and existing roadway network were already 
near saturation at peak times. The Port s planning staff sought an analysis tool capable of providing 
detailed, quantitative estimates of traffic system performance for a variety of projected scenarios and 
alternative solutions to problems anticipated by the year 2010. Consideration of the issues the Port 
faced lead to a search for a simulation modeling system with the ability to explicitly model or account 
for: 1: Trucks on roadways accessing each of the Port s major container terminal clients. 2: Effects 
of roadway characteristics on truck movements including signal and sign controlled intersections, laneage, 
intersection geometries. 3: Effects of differing ship arrival and departure schedules, and ship carrying 
capacities. 4: Effects of implementing on-dock rail facilities as a means to reduce truck traffic. 
5: Effects of imposing truck movement restrictions during peak commuting periods. 6: Effects of congestion 
on container truck movements including that related to the proposed Disney 1296 theme park. 7: Animation 
of model results using dynamic displays, showing truck behavior and movement as influenced by roadway 
and congestion effects. 8: Provision for statistics of system performance measures that are meaningful 
to Port engineers. 9: Provision for a user interface allowing for easy modification of frequently changed 
input data to expedite alternatives testing directly by Port planning staff. A review of existing transportation 
simulation models (see section 2) found no single model meeting a majority of these requirements. However, 
applications with similar requirements were demonstrated that had been developed using existing industrial 
simulation languages -programming languages commonly applied to manufacturing capacity problems (Carpenter 
and Ward, 1990). Based on the results of a pilot model, a project was commissioned to develop and validate 
an integrated discrete event simulation model (named TruckSim) to meet these requirements. The model 
is reviewed in this paper. 2 MODEL REQUIREMENTS The Port of Long Beach planning staff was particularly 
concerned that the resulting model support the container truck-specific performance issues, that the 
animation would allow port management staff to observe model operation, and that they would be able to 
independently use the model for on-going planning issues. 2.1 Background The project s model design team 
considered a number of approaches for addressing the Port s modeling problem and requirements. These 
considerations included application of existing software used by the transportation and traffic engineering 
community, modification of existing software to address the specific project requirements, and application 
of simulation software used in other fields, The existing traditional transportation software tools in 
general use can be classified into two general classes: travel demand software, and traffic operations 
models. A brief review of each class is presented here, with considerations for the project requirements. 
For a more thorough discussion, see (Byrne, et al. 1982) and (Santiago and Chen 1990) Travel demand software 
is used in gross-level analyses related to such measures as: determining lane deficiencies and requirements 
for roadway segments and corridors; levels of service (or congestion) of roadway segments; per-vehicle 
and total travel time and operating speeds on a roadway segment or corridor; or for the entire modeled 
area: vehicle emissions and fuel consumption aggregated over all vehicle trips. A number of travel demand 
software packages are available for mainframes, workstations, and especially microcomputers. Examples 
include TRANPLAN, MicroTRIPS, MINUTP, EMME/2, QRS, and TMODEL. The scope of travel demand models range 
from small areas of one square mile to entire metropolitan areas and even to entire states. These are 
static models -used to evaluate travel supply (i.e., roadway capacity) against anticipated travel demand. 
Travel demand models to not provide the types of detailed statistics relating to individual vehicle entities, 
required for the POLB project to measure intersection delays and level of service, and queue lengths. 
Further, dynamic animation is not possible since these are static models -they describe the behavior 
of the system at a single point in time, Traffic operations models, on the other hand, are very detailed 
since they are used to evaluate specific design features of roadway systems, including proper signal 
timing at signal-controlled intersections, specific lane assignments and number at intersections, and 
effects of large trucks, transit vehicles, and pedestrians on intersection level of service. Traffic 
operations models are of both the static and dynamic type. They can account for random events such as 
double parking and vehicle mixes throughout the modeled time period since they describe the behavior 
of the system over a period of time. The most applicable examples to the POLB project are network simulation 
models such as TRANSYT-7F and TRAF-NETSIM, which are also the most widely used traffic operations models. 
Both are discrete event simulation programs which work in one-second time updates. These traffic operations 
models provide for very detailed evaluation statistics including queue lengths by intersection approach, 
intersection delays and level of service, vehicle emissions and fuel consumption. Among the traffic 
operations-type software, the TRAF-NETSIM model was considered to be the most applicable to the POLB 
project. However, the model was found to be unsuitable for the POLB modeling for a variety reasons, the 
discussion of which is too lengthy for inclusion in this paper. Thus, the design team elected the third 
option -to develop a new model based on a dynamic, discrete event simulation language, with extensions 
added as required. This allowed the explicit portrayal of each truck entity , instead of aggregating 
traffic in somewhat less detailed statistical fashion.  2.2 Design Objectives The guiding design objective 
was to achieve a balance between the necessary detail needed to allow specific performance issues to 
be evaluated and a more high level or less detailed representation where possible to limit model complexity, 
data and run time requirements. The goal was to provide a tool with enough detail and accuracy to allow 
comparative performance analysis of dif f erent scenarios, but not necessarily the high level of complexity 
that would allow evaluating all system performance measures in an absolute sense, Specific design objectives 
established for the model included: o Represent truck activity related to major truck traffic generators 
within the Port with sufficient detail and accuracy to provide for meaningful assessments of impacts 
on truck traffic associated with alternative scenarios to be investigated, including peak period truck 
movement restrictions.  o Simulate traffic conditions for a 24 hour, peak activity day in the Port. 
 o Provide for analysis of truck movements affected by periodic  influences throughout the day (peaking 
characteristics of cargo loading/unloading operations, rush hour congestion, train movements, etc.) o 
Provide for the assessment of impacts related to auto traffic growth, including alternative major new 
traffic generators such as the proposed Disney theme park complex.  o Provide for the assessment of 
impacts related to assumptions of future cargo growth, transportation modes (rail vs. truck), terminal 
operating characteristics (gate hours, processing times, etc.), and train schedules. o Provide for the 
assessment of impacts related to development of the POLB Road and Railway Transportation Master Plan, 
and other reasonable roadway improvement alternatives.  o Provide output statistics meaningful for comparing 
the relative benefits and disadvantages of the above considerations.  o Provide a user interface which 
facilitates the changing of data associated with the principal analysis concerns of the Port.  o Implement 
dynamic animation with sufficient detail to allow traffic congestion and queues to be observed.  o Implement 
the model on a 386 class computer.  3 DESIGN METHODOLOGY 3.1 Overview The TruckSim model is regarded 
as a hybrid model because it mixes travel demand type modeling techniques (using averaged traffic flow 
rates and densities) with traffic operations modeling practice, in which vehicle entities are explicitly 
represented in a dynamic model. TruckSim merges the concepts of these two model types through the use 
of simulation software more typically used in industrial engineering applications. Refer to Figure 1 
for a presentation of the basic elements of the TruckSim modeling system. The software platform for the 
model is the SIMAN simulation language. Individual events, such as the arrival of a truck at a stop controlled 
intersection, trigger processes replicating the movement and behavior of individual truck entities .

Modeling System The various traffic flow and operations theories relevant to modeling POLB truck behavior 
are implemented through procedures in Siman and C-program proced~res linked to the model. These include: 
o Queuing, delay and flow formulations for sign controlled intersections including yield, two-way stop, 
and four-way stop sign control. 0 Queuing, delay and flow formulations for signalized intersections. 
 0 Queuing, delay and flow formulations for ramp junctions including merge and diverge points. 0 Queuing, 
delay and flow formulations for weaving sections. 0 Speed-density functions for arterial and freeway 
segments under uncontested and congested conditions. 0 Queuing, delay, and flow formulations for queues 
at at-grade railroad crossings, 0 Formulas for vehicle emissions and fuel consumption as functions of 
vehicle type and operating conditions. o Functions for replicating the effects of background auto traffic 
on truck movements. 0 Functions for allowing primary and secondary route selection for each truck trip, 
based on origin-destination pair (i.e., specific to each destination terminal).  3.2 Modeling Approach 
A complete description of the design and implementation of the model is beyond the scope of this paper. 
However, there are four primary modeling assumptions underlying the design of the TruckSim model system, 
which should be noted: 1: A well defined method to systematically sub-divide the roadway network into 
segments for representation and processing by a computer model. 2: The separation of simulated vehicle 
traffic into two categories to reduce the size and execution time of the model -roughly equivalent to 
those of interest to track explicitly (trucks), and those that can be treated in a less detailed fashion 
(automobiles); 3: Development of operational theory to translate established and accepted traffic density 
vs. flow rate equations into usable forms for use in assigning link traveling speeds for trucks. 4: 
Detailed and realistic modeling of truck traffic behavior at intersections is necessary to achieve the 
accuracy desired from the model.  3.2.1 Network Encoding The physical characteristics of the POLB study-area 
are encoded into a network of links and nodes for utilization by the model. This provides the information 
necessary for the processing of each truck entity through its assigned route. The representation of the 
study area into a network was possible after a survey of the existing site, Each link is unidirectional 
and assumed consistent in terms of its lane configuration, posted speed, and traffic behavior. Additional 
links are defined whenever one of these fundamental characteristics change or when a potential obstruction 
is encountered. Obstructions can be classified as controlled intersections, at-grade railroad crossings, 
or marine terminal entrance gates. A link is always bounded by two nodes which may be any combination 
of the following types: -Network entrances -Network exits -Intersections -At-grade railroad crossings 
-Diverges -Merges -Traffic flow control Network entrance nodes are origin points for truck routes and 
are boundaries to the network and POLB study area. These nodes allow for trucks to enter the network 
via designated major highways or from the water side of a marine terminal facility. For major highways 
that extend beyond the borders of the study area, it is assumed that trucks may attempt to access the 
network as soon as they are scheduled to arrive. Network exit nodes are similar to entrance nodes in 
that they are also boundaries to the network. Additionally, they serve as destination locations for the 
truck routes. Inbound trucks are destined for marine terminals and outbound trucks for major outbound 
routes. It is assumed that when a truck reaches an exit node to a major route, it will be able to leave 
the network immediately. Intersection nodes are the most complex type of node in the network due to the 
substantial amount of logic incorporated in the model to precisely process a truck through an intersection 
based on its turning movement, approach, and the control configuration implemented. To attain the desired 
performance accuracy for the potentially wide variety of physical geometries, the control type, and the 
allowable turning movements within in each lane for each approach is specified as a part of the network 
definition data. As a truck approaches an intersection the appropriate lane must be assigned based on 
its required turning movement and the defined and Seeburger approach lane configuration. If more than 
one lane is available to accomplish the turn, the truck will select the lane with the fewest number of 
trucks. This decision results in the placing of the truck entity into one of three queues for the approach: 
1) left movement, 2) general movement, and 3) right movement. The procedure as to how the truck gets 
serviced through the selected queue depends upon the control employed at the intersection. There are 
three general classes of control supported by the model: 1) signalized control, 2) all approaches are 
stop controlled, 3) not all approaches are stop controlled. Signalized control is implemented using actual 
signal patterns and timings that are typically utilized in traffic engineering. Each intersection that 
is governed by a signal may have a unique signal pattern associated with it. A signal pattern consists 
of a cycle of phases ; each phase dictates which lanes within each approach may allow traffic movement. 
Each phase has a time duration during which these movements are possible. The signal patterns along with 
the static intersection lane configurations allow for virtually every type of traffic situation to be 
modeled as required. This includes protected lefts, permissive lefts, right on red after stop, etc. Trucks 
processed through intersections that have all approaches controlled by stop signs are moved through the 
intersection on a first come, first serve basis. The only exception are trucks that can execute a right 
on red after stop.  3.2.2 Differentiation of Vehicles Trucks are introduced into the network as discrete 
entities, each with unique attributes. Each truck is assumed to execute a trip which consists of a set 
of routing instructions that explicitly describes a journey from an origin to a destination. At the time 
of entry, the following information is associated with a truck: -Cargo type -Truck size -Route number 
and destination -Time trip started -Various elapsed time and statistics collection registers There are 
four general classes of terminal operators that are included in the model. They are: 1) container, 2) 
petroleum coke, 3) non-container, and 4) container-freight stations. The cargo type indicates the type 
of terminal a truck is visiting. The behavior of a truck at a terminal in terms of gate processing delays, 
queuing at the gate complex is dependent upon the type of cargo being moved. Depending upon the terminal 
type, there are a variety of size classes that are typically handled. For example, container terminals 
accommodate fully loaded container trucks, bare tractors, and bare chassis while petroleum coke terminals 
exclusively utilize double bulk loaders. The size of the truck is considered in terms of speed calculations, 
emissions/fuel consumption and how it may traverse through congested links. The route number dictates 
the exact sequence of links and nodes that the truck must execute through the network. This information 
is critical to determine the turning movements required through intersections and to determine when an 
obstruction such as a railroad crossing is encountered. There is a substantial component of automobile 
traffic that is a part of the total traffic situation in the POLB study area. Because of the volume and 
the goal of maintaining the model on a 386 class PC, the model does not explicitly generate discrete 
automobile trips. This constituent is considered to be background traffic and is considered within the 
overall vehicle density levels on each link in the network. Each link in the network is defined to have 
a finite capacity in terms of passenger car equivalents (PCES). The capacity of each link is a function 
of the number of lanes and length. Truck entities have an assigned PCE value based on their size attribute 
when they enter the network. The model allows truck entities to traverse through individual links only 
if they can gain access to the link required. A truck is temporarily restricted to entry to a link if 
the current vehicle density has reached a level close to the calculated capacity. The vehicle density 
level is maintained by the model for each link and contains the current level of both automobile traffic 
and truck traffic. Trucks increase and decrease the density as they enter and leave the link. The background 
traffic levels are based upon a traffic engineering study which tabulates the levels anticipated and 
observed throughout the network. This study includes the background traffic levels for roadway segments 
during various time periods throughout a typical operating day. The timing aspect of the background traffic 
is critical due to rush hour behavior and the patronage profile that is projected for the Disney theme 
park. To include automobile traffic in the model, an independent process is built into the model to encompass 
this component. The influence of background traffic in terms of PCE levels is updated for each link in 
half-hour intervals. As a result of this process, the available capacity of each link is reduced for 
truck entities. This impedes trucks from entering links that are heavily congested with automobile traffic 
and has an impact upon allowable truck speed. The background traffic levels are also utilized by the 
model in the intersection processing logic. This is of particular consequence when considering the yield 
aspect for permissive left turns and two-way stop intersections. 3.2.3 Link Speed Assignments As trucks 
gain access to different links through their routing sequence, the model re-evaluates the current traveling 
speed for the entity, This is accomplished using a speed calculation that has been established in traffic 
engineering practice (see Figure 2). .. . 541 . ..- .. . . .. .. 30 -- - - - --- ­ 10 ---- -- - -

Figure 2: Speed/Density Curve Relation A linear relationship is utilized by the model that uses the 
posted speed for the link and a general jam density as constants. The variable component of the equation 
is due to the current total traffic density in PCES of the link. This equation is only used for truck 
speed calculations if the current traffic density is greater than the critical density. The critical 
density is a constant that is specific for each link and provides a theoretical threshold which is used 
to evaluate whether a speed reduction from the posted or free-flow speed should be assessed. Each time 
a truck entity enters a new link, the model calculates whether the current total traffic density is greater 
than the critical density. If it is, the speed equation is used to determine the new operating speed 
for the truck. It is assumed that the truck will travel at this speed throughout the distance of the 
link and will be maintained until an obstruction is encountered or a new link is accessed. This method 
is used for every facility type of found in the network. If a truck is stopped at an obstruction or is 
prevented from moving into an upstream link due to high levels of congestion, an acceleration delay is 
assessed. The magnitude of this delay is a scalar multiplier of the truck size of the entity. Any deceleration 
delays that may occur due to anticipated stops or slowdowns are assumed to be included in the overall 
traveling speed through a link. 4 DATA STRUCTURES The model allows for a port planner to experiment with 
a proposed network definition among a variety of port and terminal operating scenarios. The data structures 
and files used by the model consider this objective and have been intentionally designed to be easily 
modified by the port staff as infrastructure changes are proposed and terminal business conditions change. 
A significant advantage of having the input data for the model contained within easy-to-edit external 
files is that the port planner is removed from the process of changing model logic and recompiling files 
for many infrastructure and operation variations, The input files required by the model are of two broad 
categories: 1) network definition and 2) port and terminal demand forecasts. and Seeburger 4.1 Network 
Definition Data Files The network definition files are maintained in either a spreadsheet format or in 
standard text files. These files are: -Link characteristic definitions -Intersection configurations -Signal 
patterns -Origin to destination route sequences -Auto density rates The link definition file requires 
the following data elements for each link: 1) length, 2) number of lanes, and 3) posted or free-flow 
speed. This spreadsheet file also calculates and maintains the capacity and critical density for each 
link. Figure 3 shows an example of part of this file. Link Length Speed Numtw S@ Adj CaF+@ Crltialf From

configuration file contains information describing the physical geometry for each intersection node. 
The spreadsheet format provides a data-driven approach allowing for intersections to be re-designed with 
respect to many features including control type, number and type of lanes per approach, without any model 
logic revisions. The signal pattern file designates the light(s) actuated per phase within a cycle and 
the associated time durations. The quantity of phases per cycle is a variable allowing for a wide range 
of patterns to be implemented. Each phase is described by the approach and the lane(s) that may allow 
traffic movement. The lighting pattern may be specified in combinations of: 1) protected left, 2) permissive 
left, 3) green, and 4) right only. The route sequences are each specified by the series of links and 
nodes that must be executed for trucks to travel between an origin and destination pair. Additional routes 
or revisions to existing routes are possible by modifying the file with a text editor. The auto density 
rates are specified in a spreadsheet file which describes the static levels in PCES for each link within 
half-hour intervals throughout an entire operating day. 4.2 Port and Terminal Demand Data Once a network 
definition has been finalized, demands are imposed on it using a terminal operating scenario. This data 
is entered into a customized menu interface program which has been designed to support specific port-planning 
issues such as the impact of varying levels of truck restrictions during peak commuting periods. The 
menu provides a user-friendly interactive environment to organize, guide, and assist in changing values 
to create different operating plans. The interface also allows for sets of scenarios to be constructed, 
labeled, and archived for future use. 5 OUTPUT PRODUCTS The output products of TruckSim provide four 
general classes of performance statistics: -Overall port traffic performance -Roadway segments -Intersection 
nodes -Terminal operators The number of possible locations in the network for data collection is quite 
large; there are hundreds of links, nodes, and queue locations. To manage the size of output files, the 
user may select a set of links, intersections, and terminals to be tagged for each simulation run through 
a spreadsheet file which is read by the model at the beginning of each simulation run. The overall port 
performance report describes the fuel consumption for both autos and trucks during idle and in-motion, 
the emissions by pollutant for both autos and trucks, and the total count of trucks processed through 
the network. In computing both emissions and fuel consumption, the model logic considers the truck size/weight 
category, time at speed for various speed categories, idle time, and start/stop acceleration. Table 1 
shows summary fuel consumption data from model outputs comparing the alternative scenarios against the 
baseline scenario. For example, from the table we observe that Scenario 5 (peak period truck restrictions, 
with Disney) shows an overall increase in fuel consumption of 41% over Scenario 1 (1990 year baseline).

roadway network performance statistics provide the Level of Service rating for selected links for each 
30 minute interval. The method in which the rating is determined is based on the relationships defined 
in the Highway Capacity Manual. Also, the link traffic counts for the total number of trucks processed 
per 30 minute interval are reported. The intersection statistics supply the level of service and average 
delay for individual trucks processed through specified intersections for each 30 minute period. For 
the same set of intersections, the total truck delay time summed across all trucks processed, is reported 
for each 30 minute span. Table 2 shows how the simulated peak period intersection level of service varies 
over the five scenarios for a few selected network locations. The terminal statistics report the total 
individual trip times averaged across all trucks inbound and outbound to and from designated terminals. 
For the same set of destinations the total amount of travel delay time is reported. The travel delay 
time is the time greater than the free-flow time for each truck trip. The free-flow time assumes there 
are not any traffic delays due to congestion or obstructions. Table 2: Peak Period Intersection Level

the impact of infrastructure improvements considering the high volume and variety of truck traffic through 
the study area, an animation is provided. The animation uses the high-resolution version (HGA) version 
of the real-time CINEMA package in conjunction with the simulation model constructed in SIMAN. 7 MODEL 
VALIDATION Extensive debugging using the animation was performed to validate the logical correctness 
of the model code. The process included preparation of test input data sets providing for isolation of 
specific elements of the model for observation. The verification consisted of observation of the model 
animation as well as comparison of numeric output against actual data collected from field observations 
during the project. To gain confidence in using the model to gauge relative differences among simulated 
scenarios and improvements, a validation process using field data collected from the existing network 
was completed. This process is referred to as calibration. The purpose of the calibration was to define 
the parameters which are used in TruckSim to represent, mathematically, the behavior of traffic by the 
model. Through this effort, the model s mathematical relationships which describe vehicle movement are 
refined. The model was calibrated against 1990 conditions at the Port, as measured on a specific day 
of the week at various locations. Due to the magnitude of this project, there were many possible measures 
that could be compared. In addition, there was significant difficulty and expense in collecting the field 
data. Considering these issues, the following measures were selected: -Size of container terminal gate 
queues -Link truck counts -Link operating speeds -Truck travel times These standards were applied because 
they validate different assumptions and aspects of the model. Table 3 shows the calibration results for 
travel time comparisons for a few selected routes. Table 4 shows the calibration results for terminal 
queue lengths for five of the primary destination terminals. The comparison of simulated versus actual 
travel times were closely replicated especially in the heaviest traveled corridors. Table 3: Travel Time

By properly configuring the roadway network, truck trip demands, and background auto density, the model 
provides relative measures to estimate cost, air-quality, and delay impacts of different operating scenarios 
with a precision not possible with previous existing models. When making infrastructure changes to the 
network, it was generally observed that the effect of improvements may be advantageous to some terminal 
operators while they may impede the productivity of others. For example, when significant congestion 
and associated travel delays were observed at a particular intersection, it was found that simply modifying 
the design of that intersection (without regard to the overall network design) resulting in moving the 
problem elsewhere in the network -to the location of the next weak link . Several iterations of these 
runs were required to achieve a set of design modifications that balanced the traffic activity. This 
result suggests that port planners have a significant application of the model for examining the aggregate 
effect of modifications. After the global effect of network changes are resolved, the detailed animation 
and output reports provide quantitative measurements of the magnitude in which intersections, roadway 
segments, and terminal gate queues are individually affected. The port planner has the opportunity to 
adjust the applicable parameters for a critical area through the network definition files. There is considerable 
detail implemented in the model and input data especially within the realms of intersection behavior 
and link definition. During the model development phase, the appropriate level of accuracy to be represented 
in the model was debated in response to the project goals. The amount of detail implemented created a 
model that is surprisingly sensitive to variations in traffic generation rates and network changes. For 
example, this became evident when the projected traffic volumes for the year 2010 were imposed onto the 
existing area network. One of the signalized intersections adjacent to terminals with significant increases 
in cargo movement was unable to process the increased volume of trucks at an adequate rate, creating 
congestion levels with widespread impact. To correct this situation, the intersection was reconfigured 
in the spreadsheet files by adding left-hand turn lanes and adjusting the signal phase pattern for protected 
left turns. From this simple modification, the revised network was able to respond to the increased demand, 
showing dramatic improvement over the previous design. 9 CONCLUSIONS The objective to construct a hybrid 
model with enough detail to encompass the operations over a wide-ranging area was achieved. The model 
replicates reasonably accurate traffic behavior at both an aggregate and localized detail level. This 
was accomplished using the 386 class computing platform with an acceptable run execution time of approximately 
50% of real time. The external data-driven approach has been found to be flexible enough to allow significant 
variations of network design to be assembled reasonably quickly, and also for alternative overall port 
operating plans including truck restrictions during peak commuting periods, on-dock rail proposals, and 
others to be implemented. Maintaining the majority of the data outside of the model has produced an environment 
that removes the port planning staff from the simulation process and allows for emphasis to be placed 
on infrastructure and operation proposals. Despite the fact that the overall model integrates numerous 
activities across an extensive network area, the model is sufficiently sensitive to detect unstable traffic 
conditions imposed by inadequately configured intersections and increased cargo arrival rates at expanded 
terminals. These conditions can be monitored by a comprehensive set of animation screens as well as output 
reports specifically tailored to the areas under investigation. Finally, the model has been designed 
to be extendible to investigate issues that may be demanded in the future such as additional air quality 
issues and terminal operating cost impacts due to port improvements. Further enhancements currently under 
investigation include automatic generation of input data sets from an enhanced AutoCad drawing using 
an intelligent interface program; automatic route selection and dynamic re-routing of truck entities 
during run time based on congestion encountered; enhanced animation using more detail for zoom and pan
