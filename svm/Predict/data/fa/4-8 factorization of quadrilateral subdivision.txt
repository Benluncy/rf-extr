structures traditionally used for subdivision are de- rived from regular triangular or quadrilateral 
tilings. In con- trast, the 4-8 mesh is based on the Laves tilings of type [4.82], which is a triangulated 
quadrangulation [3]. The semi-regular 4-8 mesh is a hierarchical structure for subdivi- sion surfaces 
that has powerful adaptation capabilities [4]. In this work, we show how to construct Catmull-Clark [1] 
and Doo-Sabin [2] surfaces, using 4-8 mesh refinement. We de- compose the associated subdivision schemes 
into rules that are compatible with the underlying 4--8 mesh structure. Our motivation for developing 
such methods is to incorporate the power of 4-8 meshes into the above classical subdivision surfaces. 
 2 4-8 Mesh Refinement The refinement of 4-8 meshes is composed of two binary subdivision steps. In the 
first step, the mesh is refined in the horizontal and vertical directions, while in the second step, 
the mesh is refined in the two diagonal directions. This process is illustrated in Figure 1. One of the 
most remarkable features of the 4--8 mesh is that it produces, at the same time, both primal and dual 
re- finement of its (triangulated) quadrilateral blocks. At odd subdivision levels, the process induces 
primal refinement, while at even subdivision levels dual refinement is obtained. Permission to make digital

the old ver- tices are not discarded. They are kept, but don't influence the geometry of the mesh. Also, 
the new dual mesh is only completely defined in the beginning of the next cycle, after insertion of horizontal/vertical 
edges. 303 3 Catmull-ClarkFactorization The Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme is based on primal refinement 
and it is composed of face, edge, and corner rules. The principle for decomposing this scheme using 4-8 
meshes is to distribute these rules at the appropriate steps of 4-8 refinement. According to this principle, 
face and comer rules are applied at even steps, while the edge rule is applied at odd steps. At even 
steps, first the face rule is computed. New ver- tices at the center of each quadrilateral block are 
computed as the average of the four old vertices in their 1-neighborhood. Next, the comer rule is computed. 
Old vertices are updated using the information gathered in the computation of face rules. Note that, 
the star of every old vertex consists of an alternating sequence of new and old vertices. The new value 
of a comer vertex, a~, is computed as a linear combination of three types of vertices in the 1-neighborhood 
ofao: new ver- tices ci; old vertices hi; and the comer vertex itself, ao. There are 2n vertices in the 
star of a0, and thus, i = 1,..., n. The comer rule is ii Â¢1 i=1 i=1 where = and = = 1 n--'~ At odd steps, 
the edge rule is computed. The values of new vertices are obtained from values at their four 1-neighbors 
(Note that, the star of a new edge vertex consists of exactly 4 vertices: two of them, Co and cl, correspond 
to the centers of quadrilateral blocks created in the previous subdivision step. The two remaining vertices, 
bo and b] are comer ver- tices from two adjacent faces sharing the subdivided edge, for which the rule 
is being computed). The decomposed 4-8 edge rule for edge midpoint d is 1 d= ~ (bo +bl +Co -t- el) The 
decomposed masks for Catmull-Clark subdivision are shown below. 1 41 . A4 -_ -_ 4 4 ne (a) face ('0)

and it employs a single rule. For each n-sided face, new smaller n-sided faces are created by inserting 
new vertices in the interior of current faces and connecting these vertices across the edges of current 
faces. The principle to decompose the Doo-Sabin subdivision scheme is based on the observation that, 
in a 4-8 mesh, all dual blocks have a central vertex which is linked to each cor- ner of the block, as 
shown below: an_ 2 ~ ~ ~ ....  -~/~'.."I \ /\ s .z~/\ I , -~. n-ffl'~ \ I / tIP\ a~T/ a2 % So a 1 The 
decomposed 4--8 subdivision rule uses the old vertex ao, and the midpoints, {Si}i=O,...n_l, of the edges 
of the dual block. These midpoints are accessed through the center vertex c, because they are all in 
the star ofc. From ao and si, i = 1,...,n-2, we get the values ofai, i = 1,...,n -1. Since si : z , the 
value ofai+l = 2si -ai Once that is done, we simply apply rt-1 a 0 ~ Otiai, i=0 where ai are coefficients 
of the Doo-Sabin rule: ao = ~1 + and ai = 3-}-2cos(27ri/n) an ,i= 1,...n-1.  References <RefA>[1] <SinRef><author>E. Catmull </author>
