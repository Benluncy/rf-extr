 One Stop Shopping Getting Connected at Texas A&#38;M University Teresa Chipman Computing &#38; Information

The first few weeks of the fall semester are the busiest time of the year for Computing and Information 
Services. The entire help desk staff is focused on a single objective: introducing the computer resources 
available at Texas A&#38;M to new students. Because the students have a lot going at the beginning of 
the semester, and setting up computer accounts can be complex, we wanted a way to streamline the process. 
We came up with a service where these students could get their computing resource accounts set up and 
their personal computers ready to connect to TAMU network.  Keywords Setting up, new student, incoming 
freshman, networking software, computer resources, TAMU e-mail. 1. INTRODUCTION In the fall of 1999, 
the One Stop Shopping process was implemented. The students could come directly to Help Desk Central 
(HDC) located in the Teague Building on campus where Help Desk employees would help them set up or make 
changes to their BASIC computer account (Provides users access to the Open Access Labs account, as well 
as access to the UNIX system. These systems support e-mail, FTP, news and programming and web pages.) 
through the Computer Logon-ID &#38; Account Information Manager (CLAIM) program and also activate their 
e­mail account. In order to meet the needs of the first time users, new student computer account classes 
are held every 30-minutes at our largest Open Access lab located next door to the Teague Bldg. Next to 
the HDC area is the Networking Help Desk (NHD) where the students could bring their computers in and 
get them prepared for Internet access. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this

Easy as 1-2-3 Setting up computer resource accounts is as easy as 1-2-3. All registered students are 
given access to computer accounts and services through their Computing Access Fees. The resource that 
allows access to Open Access Lab computers, software and peripherals is called Computer Logon-ID &#38; 
Account Information Manager or CLAIM (http://cis.tamu.edu/help/handouts/general/TAMUCLAIM.html). New 
student computer account classes are held Monday-Friday, every 30-minutes, one-week before the fall semester 
starts (Freshman Orientation Week) and one week following the beginning of classes. A Senior Support 
Staff member of HDC or an Open Access Lab Supervisor conducts these new student computer account classes. 
In these classes, students activate their BASIC (Labs and Unix) computer accounts and computer services 
such as modems (required resource for dialing into TAMU modems), VPN (useful for remote ((outside of 
the campus firewall)) users who need the same internet access to TAMU campus resources as if they were 
directly connected to the campus network), and Xprint. During these short classes, the students also 
activate their TAMU e-mail accounts. We have a new IMAP e-mail system that allows students to check their 
e-mail from any web browser. Since this is a new e-mail system that ALL students are required to use 
in order to receive official mail from the University, all returning students will need to activate their 
accounts. They can do this by opening either MS Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator and typing in 
http://neo.tamu.edu/account. In order to accommodate the students that come directly to Help Desk Central 
for help, the Senior Support Staff reserve the classroom located in the Teague Bldg the first two weeks 
of the Fall semester and help these students set up their computer accounts. HDC student workers also 
man this classroom. New student computer account classes for incoming freshman in the Corps of Cadets 
is also scheduled during Freshman Orientation Week (FOW). These classes are held on the second floor 
of the Student Computing Center Open Access Lab. Once again a Senior Support Staff from Help Desk Central 
helps coordinate these classes for the Corps. If it is not convenient for the students to attend one 
of the above classes, then they can activate their BASIC computer account and TAMU e-mail account by 
going to any Open Access Lab on campus and asking a Help Desk employee for help. 1 Handouts with step-by-step 
instructions are available in any of the Open Access labs located across campus. Figure 1: Texas A&#38;M 
Campus Map  2.1 Preparing your computer for Internet access Students who are bringing a computer in 
the fall can utilize the Networking Help Desk (NHD), located next door to the HDC, to get their computers 
ready. (NOTE: We do not sell Ethernet cards or CAT 5 twisted-pair Ethernet cables with RJ-45 connectors 
on campus. The student should purchase these items before they start school.) Figure 2: Floor Plan of 
West Side of Teague Building The following services are offered by NHD: 1. Install Ethernet card for 
$10.00 2. Install the Ethernet card along with TAMUNet7.0 software for $30.00 (Explanation of TAMUNet 
7.0 software is listed below.) 3. Install TAMUNet7.0 software at a cost of $20/machine ($10.00 is the 
cost of the TAMUNet  7.0 CD and $10.00 is for installation.) The students can bring their computers 
into the NHD office and leave them. Tickets are filled out when the computers are brought in that state 
what is needed to be installed and a phone number where we can reach the student. The students are contacted 
when their computer is ready. Since ResNet registration is a must before you can have Internet access 
here at Texas A&#38;M, the students are asked to log into their computer and register their machines 
with ResNet at http://www.resnet.tamu.edu/registration. Once the student returns to their dorm rooms, 
all they have to do is plug their computer into the Ethernet line. The entire process normally takes 
about 30-45 minutes per machine. During the first few weeks of the fall we have a staff of six (6) student 
workers manning this area from 8am-6pm, Monday-Saturday. 2.1.1 On-campus users If the students are going 
to live on-campus, they will need to purchase and have installed an Ethernet card in their computer in 
order use the campus residential computing network (ResNet). These Ethernet cards should be a 10Base 
T or 10/100 Base T. The student will also need to purchase and bring a 20-25 foot, Category-5 (CAT5) 
twisted-pair Ethernet cable with RJ-45 connectors to connect their computer to the Ethernet wall connection. 
 2.1.2 Off-campus users Off-campus users are able to dial into TAMU for access to the Internet and campus 
resources through a modem bank of over 2,000 56K V.90 modems. Computing and Information Services also 
supports high-speed access through DSL and cable modems. 3. TAMUNET7.0 SOFTWARE TAMUNet7.0 is a compilation 
of Internet software programs designed for the convenience of the Texas A&#38;M user (1). The web page 
for TAMUNet is located at http://tamunet.tamu.edu. Following are the different programs that are included 
in TAMUNet: 1. Netscape Communicator: World Wide Web Browser, including an E-mail reader, a newsgroup 
reader, and a Home Page (HTML) editor. 2. Tera Term Telnet: Text only program that allows you to connect 
to UNIX, ACS and other servers. 3. QWS3270 Telnet: The aTm screen (BONFIRE, PHONBOOK, NOTIS, CLAIM AND 
VM). 4. An FTP program for transferring files between your computer and another computer. 5. Free Agent: 
A Newsgroup Reader 6. Pegasus: Graphical E-mail program for sending and receiving E-mail on LABS, UNIX 
or ACS servers.  TAMUNet is not necessary in order to obtain Internet access with Texas A&#38;M as your 
Internet provider. If you already have 51 the programs listed above, there is no need for the TAMUNet 
package. If at a later time you need TAMUNet, you may obtain it in one of the following manners: 1. By 
downloading the software from an on-campus computer, including lab computers, or from a computer connected 
to the Texas A&#38;M modem bank. 2. By obtaining a TAMUNet CD from the Networking Help Desk in the Teague 
Building for a fee of $10, or three of the five labs located across campus. 3. By borrowing the CD from 
another student, loading the software on your computer and returning it to the owner.  Instructions 
on how to install TAMUNet7.0 are also available at any of the Open Access Labs on campus; Help Desk Central; 
Networking Help Desk or from the handouts located at the following website: http://cis.tamu.edu/help/handouts. 
4. CONCLUSION This One Stop Shopping streamlined the entire process of getting connected at Texas A&#38;M 
for new students and returning students. During this time of the year, Help Desk Central and Networking 
Help Desk employees become one big family with the same goal in mind -- to help the students get their 
computer accounts and computers set up properly with as little difficultly as possible. This same service 
and goals are continued throughout the entire year. Placing large posters in each of the Open Access 
Labs across campus is one way we advertise these services. Also, 8 ½ x 11 flyers that list all of the 
above services are distributed to each dorm room on campus. 5. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Special thanks to Mike
