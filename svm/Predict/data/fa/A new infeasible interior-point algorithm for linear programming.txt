algorithm for solving linear programs using a relaxed notion of the central path, called quasicentral 
path, as a central region. The algorithm starts from an infeasible point which satis.es that the norm 
of the dual condition is less than the norm of the primal condition. We use weighted sets as proximity 
measures of the quasicentral path, and a new merit function for making progress toward this central region. 
We test the algorithm on a set of NETLIB problems obtaining promising numerical results. Categories and

for problems (1) and (2) if (x, z) > 0. For µ> 0, a point on the central path satis.es the per­turbed 
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions associated with problems (1) and (2) are 01 Ax - b Fµ(x, y, z)= @AT

X .z µe - XZe Now, the perturbed KKT conditions promote global con­vergence and avoids the procedure 
for converging to spuri­ous solutions. The central path has the property that runs through the strictly 
feasible set 2n+mT Fo = {(x, y, z) . IR: Ax = b,Ay+z = c, (x, z) > 0}, keeps iterates at an adequate 
distance from the non-optimal borders, and ends at a particular solution called the analytic center. 
Due to this property, most of the primal-dual interior­point algorithms are based on following explicitly 
or implic­itly the central path as a guide for obtaining a solution of the primal and dual problems. 
Contrary to this central region, we use a relaxed notion of the central path called quasicen­tral path 
introduced in nonlinear programming by [1, 2], and analyzed in [3]. The use of the quasicentral path, 
as opposed to the central path, yields a de.nite advantage. Speci.cally, for problems where the strictly 
feasible set Fo is empty. 2. PATH-FOLLOWING STRATEGY We present a general description of a path-following 
strat­egy as follows: For a .xed µ> 0, working from an interior point (x, y, z), apply a linesearch Newton 
s method to the perturbed KKT conditions until an iterate arrives at a spec­i.ed measure of nearness 
of the central region. If an optimal solution is not found, decrease µ and the process is repeated. A 
solution is found as µ approaches zero. The quasicentral path, introduced by [1, 2], is de.ned as the 
collection of points (x, z) > 0 parameterized by µ> 0such that Ax -b =0, and XZe -µe =0 . The quasicentral 
path is equivalent to the region of strictly feasible points for the primal problem. Now, let us de.ne 
the errors for the primal and dual equa­tions as k kT ep = b -Axk, and ed = c -Ayk -zk. Proposition 1. 
If the initial point is such that Ie 0 dI= 0 kk IepI, then the dual error, ed, is zero if the primal 
error, ep, is zero. Proof. By applying a damped Newton s method to primal and dual residuals at an infeasible 
starting point, then e 1 = b -Ax1 =(1 -a1) epo , and p 1 To ed = c -Ay1 -z1 =(1 -a1) ed. Iteratively, 
we obtain k Y epk = b -Axk = (1 -aj ) epo , and j=1 k Y kT o ed = c -Ayk -zk = (1 -aj) ed. j=1 The proof 
follows from the last two equations, and the fact that Ie 0 dI=Ie 0 pI. . This property suggests that 
the quasicentral path can be used as a central region to reach a solution of the problem. Instead of 
following the quasicentral path exactly, which re­quires high computational cost, proximity measures 
of the quasicentral path are de.ned. For µ> 0and . .(0, 1), we say that a point (x> 0,z > 0) .IRn+n is 
su.ciently close to the quasicentral path, if it is contained in the following neighborhood: 2 -1/22 
N(.µ)= {IAx -bI+ I(XZ)(XZe -µe)I=.µ}. To make progress to the quasicentral path, we use the fol­lowing 
function as a merit function: X 2 Fµ(x, z)= 1 IAx -bI+ n (xizi -µ ln(xizi)). 2 i=1 The Newton step is 
a descent direction for this function at any point that is not in the quasicentral path.  3. INFEASIBLE 
ALGORITHM We present an infeasible path-following algorithm for com­puting a solution that uses the primal-dual 
interior-point framework proposed by [4]. The quasicentral path is used Table 1: Numerical Results for

NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTATION The Algorithm 3.1, written in MATLAB, was run on a set of ten NETLIB problems 
using a Sun Ultra 10 machine. We report the number of Newton iterations it took for solving each problem 
on Table I. The perturbation parameter µ is updated by µ =10-2 *( IepI2 + I(XZ)-1/2(XZe -µe)I2) when 
the iterate (x, z) is inside the proximity measure set. We set the initial value of y = 0, and choose 
the initial point (x, z) using a standard procedure. Now if Ib-AxI> Ic-zI, we .nd a positive scalar . 
such that Ic -zI=Ib -A(.x)I, and let the initial point be (.x, z). 5. CONCLUSIONS We present an infeasible 
primal-dual interior-point algo­rithm for linear programming featuring a new central region called quasicentral 
path, a new merit function, and weighted proximity measures. The dual variable y does not play any role, 
at least explicity, in our procedure. The numerical re­sults indicate the quasicentral path is enough 
to guide the iterates to a solution of the problem. Further numerical and theoretical research is needed 
to establish the role that the quasicentral path plays for solving linear programming problems. 6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
