University of Lugano 6900 Lugano, Switzerland walter.binder@usi.ch  ABSTRACT The 4th Workshop on Emerging 
Web Service Technology (WEWST 2009), collocated with the 7th IEEE European Conference on Web Services 
(ECOWS 2009), addresses emerg­ing aspects of Web services. It features one invited paper and four regular 
papers. Categories and Subject Descriptors A.0 [GENERAL]: Conference proceedings  General Terms Algorithms, 
Design, Languages, Management, Performance, Reliability, Security Keywords Service-oriented architectures, 
Business processes, Web ser­vices 1. INTRODUCTION Web services o.er many compelling opportunities to 
ad­dress pressing problems in large IT infrastructures and en­terprise application integration. They 
promote a new ap­proach for building distributed applications by composing reusable services thanks to 
well-de.ned interoperation se­mantics based on standard protocols. This new approach to software development 
based on reuse and composition promises many bene.ts, such as extensibility, ease of main­tenance, and 
reduced development e.ort and cost. For these reasons, Web services have attracted much attention in 
both academia and industry. The 4th Workshop on Emerging Web Service Technology (WEWST 2009), collocated 
with the 7th IEEE European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS 2009), is the premier workshop for academic 
and industrial communities to dis­cuss innovative ideas and research contributions advancing the state-of-the-art 
in Web service technologies. Although Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this

dret@berkeley.edu  the advantages of Web services to allow businesses to in­teract with each other while 
maintaining a loose coupling are well known, there are still many challenges to be solved in this important 
.eld of research. The wide variety of tools, techniques, and technological solutions presented in WEWST 
share one common feature: they suggest new di­rections for Web service research by introducing new and 
sometime controversial ideas into the .eld. The workshop allows participants to gain new insights and 
to start collab­orations by discussing how their own work can be used in related but di.erent areas. 
WEWST 2009 took place on November 9, 2009, in Eind­hoven, The Netherlands. WEWST 2009 is the fourth in 
the series of WEWST workshops. The previous editions of WEWST were held in 2006 in Z¨ urich [2], in 2007 
in Halle [3], and in 2008 in Dublin [1]. Since the .rst edition, WEWST has been collocated with the European 
Conference on Web Services (ECOWS). 2. WORKSHOP THEMES The WEWST workshops address emerging aspects 
of Web services, including (but not limited to) topics such as self-organizing service-oriented architectures, 
 dynamic service discovery,  automated service composition,  dynamic service binding,  service evolution, 
 coordination and business transactions,  embedded devices and sensors as services,  streaming services, 
 event-driven architectures,  middleware for service-oriented architectures,  service-level agreements, 
 reputation mechanisms, and  technologies for social collaborations and service mar­kets.  1  3. 
ORGANIZERS Walter Binder is senior assistant professor at the Fac­ulty of Informatics, University of 
Lugano, Switzerland. He holds a MSc., a PhD., and a venia docendi from the Vienna University of Technology. 
Before joining the University of Lugano, he was a senior researcher at the Arti.cial Intel­ligence Laboratory, 
Ecole Polytechnique F´ed´erale de Lau­sanne (EPFL). His main research interests are in the area of dynamic 
program analysis, program transformations, vir­tual execution environments, aspect-oriented programming, 
and service-oriented computing. Erik Wilde is associate adjunct professor at the UC Berkeley School of 
Information. He holds a diploma in com­puter science from the Technical University of Berlin, and a Ph.D. 
from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z¨ urich, Switzerland. His general interest is Web 
architecture and Web-oriented information architecture. His research fo­cus is on XML and related technologies, 
Web services and REST, and loosely coupled architectures for exposing data and services in easily usable 
and accessible ways. 4. PROGRAM COMMITTEE The program committee of WEWST 2009 consists of: Luciano
