Imaging Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Michigan Abstract 
The problem of approximating the surface spanning a given set of 3D points as a polyhedron of triangular 
faces ("triangulation") is a significant one, and has many appli- cations in the fields of computer graphics 
and computer vision. In this paper, several solutions to this problem are reviewed. These solutions can 
be grouped into two classes, and particular emphasis is given to the class of surfaces spanned by parallel 
planar contours. For a con-tour pair Po, PI,,Pm_I and Q0,Q1, Qn-], a graph theoretic approach can be 
used to arrive at a class of solutions, each requiring exactly m+n steps to triangulate the pair. Existing 
methods (both rigorous and heuristic) for extracting a particular solution from this group are reviewed, 
and a new heuristic based on inter-contour coherence is proposed. This heuristic is being used in the 
field of Ultrasonic Non-destructive Evaluation to produce images of flaws in pressure vessels, and its 
performance is shown to compare favorably with methods of greater computational complexity. It is believed 
that this heuris-tic can also be used with success in industrial vision sys-tems where similar contours 
are obtained using a laser range finder. Keywords: Computer Graphics, Triangulation, Heuristic Methods,

paper we describe an efficient heuristic for tri- angulation of the 3D surface formed by spanning a set 
of planar contours. These contours can have arbitrary geometry, but are constrained to be planar. The 
algorithm imposes no restriction on the orientation of the contours in relation to each other, but seems 
to work best when the contours are nearly parallel. Such contours are typical of those one might obtain 
with a computer vision system that uses a laser beam to determine cross sectional data of arbi- trary 
curved objects. In determining the spanning surface formed by these contours there is an inherent assumption 
that the contours belong to a single object. The algorithm as presented in Section 4.3.3 has been used 
for obtaining the surface of flaws in the field of Non-destructive Evaluation. However, the heuristic 
is fairly gen- eral and robust, and is useful in other applications as well, notably industrial vision 
systems. 2. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM The general triangulation problem can be stated as fol- lows. Given 
a set of points in space, determine the most reasonable model for the 3D surface approximated by these 
points. Certainly the simplest model from a computational view would be the approximation of the surface 
by a polyhedron of triangular faces. A set S of n unique 3D points Po,P],..Pn-1 can be clas- sified in 
(at least) one of two ways. Each of these classifi-cations has properties not present in the other, and 
thus pose two distinct triangulation problems. First, S can be composed of n points distributed arbitrarily 
in space with no assumed connectivity between them, as illustrated in Figure 1. This is the general case, 
and presents a very difficult problem in triangulation. Two methods for solving this case have recently 
been pro-posed[1,2], and are reviewed in section 3.  2 o o + Permission to copy without fee all or part

$00.75 Figure 2. Alternately, S can be composed of n points distri-buted onto a number of parallel 
planar contours, as seen in Figure 2. This is a very important special case, one which has been studied 
extensively[3,4,5,6]. A methodology for defining a class of solutions for this case is given in section 
4, along with a review of methods, both rigorous and heuris- tic, for extracting a particular solution 
which has certain desirable features. A new triangulation method has been developed by the authors, and 
is being used in the field of Ultrasonic Non-destructive Evaluation. A detailed presentation of this 
method is given in section 4.3.3. 3. GENERAL SOLUTION A set S of distinct 3D points placed arbitrarily 
in space can be represented by a graph TIV.A], where the set of ver- tices V corresponds to S, and the 
set of arcs A represents the edges of some polyhedron formed by these points, as shown in Figure 3. Two 
algorithms for triangulating a set represented in this way, i. e., to determine a set of arcs A corresponding 
to a polyhedron of triangular faces, have recently been published. One method, proposed by Boissonnat 
and Faugeras[1 ], takes an iterative approach, making progressively higher-order approximations to the 
surface by recursively sub-dividing the graph and independently triangulating these smaller surfaces 
until an acceptable error level is reached. Another method, proposed by O'Roarke[2] is to shrink the 
convex hull enclosing a set of points S to a polyhedral approximation of the surface. Furthermore, a 
simple polyhedron formed in this way is the minima/ surface area polyhedron for S if no other simple 
polyhedron whose vertex set is precisely S has a smaller surface area. Two justifications could be given 
for choosing the con-vex hull as the starting point. First, the convex hull is the only simple polyhedron 
for its vertices, and is hence the minimum surface area polyhedron for its vertices. Second, physical 
objects have large convex areas which would coin- cide with the hull, so an algorithm starting from the 
hull would be fast and accurate on these objects. The above algorithms cannot be called "optimal" in 
the sense that they include a heuristic step to remove edges of the polyhedron after they have been added 
if such a step will "improve"[21 the surface. Indeed, it has been postu-lated that the problem of finding 
the optimal polyhedral approximation of the object described by a set of 3D points is NP-hard" [2]. However, 
restricting the kind of surfaces considered will not only make the task of finding the best triangular 
fit possible, but also can make available heuristic 1 2 4 1 Figure 3. methods which, while not finding 
the "optimal" surface, are fast and reasonably accurate. 4. SURFACE BETWEEN PLANAR CONTOURS A very practical 
and useful restriction is that points in S be distributed onto parallel planar closed contours. A methodology 
for solving the triangulation problem for this case is presented here, along with two "optimal" solutions. 
Heuristic methods which provide rapid, but not optimal, solu- tions are also presented. 4.1. METHODOLOGY 
The method for describing the outer surface spanning two adjacent planar contours is as follows. Let 
the "upper" contour be described as a series of m distinct points Po,PI.,.,Pm_]; the "lower" contour 
is described as a series of n distinct points QO,Q],..Qn_I. Unlike the general case described earlier, 
connectivity of the points is implied by their ordering. Furthermore, the contours can have no points 
in common. A contour segment is a linear approximation of the curve connecting consecutive points. An 
e/ementary tile is a triangular face composed of a single contour segment and two spans connecting the 
endpoints of a contour segment with a common point on the adjacent contour. The spans will be designated 
as "left" and "right" for obvious reasons (Figure 4). The set of elementary tiles which define a surface 
will, by definition, satisfy two constraints: (1) Each contour segment will appear in exactly one ele-mentary 
tile. The set will therefore contain exactly m+n tiles. (2) If a span appears as the left (right) span 
of some tile in the set, it will appear as the right (left) span of exactly one other tile in the set. 
   Po' . p'~-.~.~ contour / ~'~.~ segment/ n-1 ~  +o,,j/+..,. ; Figure 4, It has been shown]-3] 
that a set of tiles not consistent with these criteria cannot completely describe the outer surface between 
adjacent planar contours. A set of tiles which satisfies them is called an acceptable surface. The set 
of all acceptable surfaces for the contour pair Po,P]..+Pm_1 and QO,Q], Qn_j can be represented by a 
directed graph GIV,A ~. The set of vertices I/ corresponds to the set of all possible spans between the 
upper contour and the lower contour. The set of arcs A corresponds to all pos- sible elementary tiles. 
An arc will be incident from the ver-tex which represents the left span of the tile, and will be incident 
to the vertex which represent the right span of that tile. An arc Ivij,vij+l] joining columns j and j+l 
is called horizontal. An arc [vij,vl+],j] joining rows i and i+ 1 is called vertical. Such a graph is 
given in Figure 5. An acceptable surface is a path from vertex Voo to ver- tex Vmn. The number of acceptable 
surfaces for a contour pair of m and n points, respectively, is a function A~m,n], which can be reoursively 
determined as follows: Aim,n] = A[(m-l),n] + A[m,(n-1)] Aim,l] = i for allm All,n] = 1 for alln Hence 
i 0 1 2 m-1 1 ,,,.+~ --++ 2 v v vi j -# i ~ I "~ I T.? T T Aim,n] = ~(m-1) + (n-1)l~ /m-l~! (n-l)! 
A plot of Aim,n] is given in Figure 6 illustrating just how rapidly this function increases with m and 
n. With such a large number of acceptable surfaces avail-able, a method for selecting the "most acceptable" 
surface must be determined, and clearly an exhaustive search is prohibitively slow, even for exceedingly 
simple contour pairs. Consider a function p:A -* R mapping the set of elemen- tary tiles onto the real 
numbers. Associated now with every arc a is a weight ~a, which is the the value of ~ for that tile. The 
path of an acceptable surface will have exactly m+n arcs al,a2,...am+ n. The path chosen will be such 
that the function rn+n k= satisfies some predefined constraint(s). Two classes of functions are presented: 
First, functions which "optimize" some characteristic of the surface generated; second, functions which 
are computationally expedient and are rea-sonable approximations to the optimal case. 4.2. OPTIMAL METHODS 
Fuchs, etal.[3] defined the optimal surface between two parallel planar contours to be an acceptable 
surface such that ~ is minimal. Such a path is the minimal weighted path. Fuchs defined ~ to be the surface 
area of an accept- able surface, the optimal surface being such that this area is minimal. This is, for 
the important special case considered here, the minimal surface area polyhedron sought by thB O'Roarke 
method. Alternately, Keppel[4] proposed that the optimal sur-face be an acceptable surface such that 
~ is maximal. Such a path is the maximal weighted path. Keppel defined to be the enclosed volume of an 
acceptable surface. Sur- faces defined in this way have many applications, particu- larly in the fields 
of radiation therapy and plastic surgery. i + Jl la Figure 5. Figure 6. Neither the maximal nor the 
minimal weighted path can be found using local decision-making only. Efficient methods of global graph 
searching are needed, and many have been proposed[3,7]. However, approximations to these optimal methods, 
based on local heuristic decisions and never requiring more than m+n steps to triangulate a contour pair, 
have been shown to work very well on a large class of sur-faces. 4.3. HEURISTIC METHODS If some knowledge 
of the nature of the object being modeled is obtainable, then heuristic methods of triangula-tion, never 
needing more than m+n steps for a contour pair can be used. These methods come into play often when speed 
of computation is of higher importance than "optimal" results. Heuristic methods can be described in 
the same way as the optimal algorithms in the previous section. These methods still seek an acceptably 
weighted path from Vo0 to Vmn, but do not require that this path be maximal or minimal in any sense. 
The weighting function, however, must be: (a) based on local constraints only; (b) Computationally inexpensive. 
  Two known heuristic methods are reviewed in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, and a new heuristic is introduced 
in section 4.3.8. 4.3.1. Keppel's Approximation An approximation for the maximal volume method[4] can 
be determined as follows. Consider a function ;c h defined only for horizontal arcs and another function 
~v defined only for vertical arcs. We will define these functions as follows. Associated with every horizontal 
arc [vij,v/j+l ] is a tetrahedron  T~" IPjPj+ iQlOq} where Oq is any point lying on the interior of 
the lower con-tour. The value of ~h for this arc is defined to be the volume of T/~. Similarly, every 
vertical arc [vij,vi+l,j] has a corresponding tetrahedron T~j {PjQ/Q/+ 10/~ where Op is any point lying 
on the interior of the upper con-tour. The value of ~v for this arc is defined to be the volume of T/~.. 
The path of an acceptable surface will have m hor-izontal arcs ho,h],...hm_ 1 and n vertical arcs Vo,Vl,...Vn_ 
]. Define m--1 n--1 ~= j~=o~hJ+/~=o~V I This function is locally maximized as follows. At any vertex 
v U, compute ~h = VOI T~j and ~o v = vol T~" If ~h>~v mark the horizontal arc, and move on to consider 
vertex v/,j+ 1. Else mark the vertical arc and move down to consider vertex vl+lj. In this manner, a 
locally maximal weighted path can be found in exactly m+n steps. This method must be performed on sequences 
of con-tour points forming exclusively convex or concave seg-ments. Consequently, significant preprocessing 
must be per- formed on a contour pair before triangulating. Furthermore, the algorithm seeks to maximize 
the tetrahedral volumes for convex segments, while minimizing these volumes for concave segments. These 
implementational issues will be addressed further in section 4.3.4. 4.3.2. Christianson Heuristic It 
has been pointed out by Christianson and Seder-berg[5] that heuristic methods perform best on contour 
pairs which are coherent in size and shape, and mutually centered. More importantly, contour pairs not 
satisfying these criteria can be transformed such that they do, and the application of heuristics to 
such a transformed pair pro- duces good results. One method of achieving size, shape, and orientation 
coherence is to transform a contour pair to lie within a unit square centered at the origin. An approximation 
for the minimal weighted path, operating on contours transformed in this manner is as fol-lows. The weight 
~a for an arc is defined to be the length of the span, and the tile with the shorter span is selected. 
In this way, the function ~ is locally minimized at each vertex. 4.3.3. A New Heuristic A further improvement 
of coherence between a contour pair can be achieved by transforming the contours such that the perimeter 
of each is exactly equal to 1. A new triangu-lation method proposed by the authors is designed to operate 
on transformed contours of this type. This method is currently being used in Ultrasonic Non-destructive 
Evalua-tion of pressure vessels. Sample images are presented in Section 5. ~a of an elementary tile is 
defined here to be the length of the contour segment included in the tile, divided by the perimeter of 
the contour on which that segment lies. Two facts follow immediately from this definition. First, for 
the m horizontal arcs and n vertical arcs of an acceptable surface; m ~h = ~ahl~-1 ---- 1~ /= and n 
~v = j~=l~aVj = 1 Second, ~ = ~h+~ v is exactly equal to 2 for all acceptable surfaces. While ~ has 
equal value for all acceptable surfaces, all such surfaces are not "equally acceptable". The order in 
which the contour segments are visited is the determining factor, and has physical significance. For 
a pair of contours of close size and shape coherence, triangulation should proceed along each contour 
at approximately the same rate, eliminating the formation of surfaces possessing artificially exaggerated 
surface tension. Left to its own devices, a physical body will always assume the shape of least ten-sion, 
justifying such an approach. With this in mind, the heuristic can be stated as fol-lows: Tiles are added 
to the surface in such a way that the absolute difference between sum of the horizontal weights and the 
sum of the vertical weights is minimized at all times. When an acceptable surface is reached, this difference 
will be O. The converse is not necessarily true. A demonstration of a typical step in this method is 
illus- trated in Figure 7. #~h represents the normalized distance along the upper contour visited. ~v 
is similarly defined for the lower contour. The next tile to be added to the surface can only be PjPj+IQi 
or PjQ/Qi+1. PjPj+IQi is chosen if l~h'+~h--~v'[ < I~v"l-~v--ff#h ' ] 4.3.3.1 In this case, j is incremented, 
and we proceed along the upper contour. Otherwise, PjQJQi+] is chosen, i is incre-mented, and we proceed 
along the lower contour. This method will require exactly m+n steps to perform the Computer Graphics 
Volume 1 6, Number 3 July 1982 Figure 7, complete triangulation of a contour pair. Another heuristic 
conceptually similar to this one (and seemingly simpler) is to add tiles based on cumulative perim- eter 
visited only, rather than on the absolute difference. The two methods can be related, and justification 
for choosing one over the other can be made, in the following manner. If cumulative perimeter is the 
only criterion, the tri-angulation process can be stated thus, using the same notation as above. PjP.i+~Qi 
is chosen if ~h'+~Ch < ~v'+~v; else choose PjQ/QI+p Rearranging terms and taking abso-lute value yields 
the inequality I~h "l-~h--~2v' l < I~vI+ 4.3.3.2 Rearranging the right hand side of inequality 4.3.3.1 
pro-duces the new inequality  t't'h'+~h--'+,,"l < l~,,+C'+,;-">h')l+ 4.a.3.a Clearly inequalities 4.3.3.2 
and 4.8.3.3 are identical up to the term ~v'--~Ph'. In the ideal case, when the formation of the outer 
surface proceeds along each contour at exactly the same rate, this term is precisely zero, and the heuristics 
are identical. However, in triangulation this ideal case is hardly, if ever, obtainable, and this term 
must be incor-porated into the decision. Hence the method of absolute difference is chosen. The choice 
of which pair of points from which to begin the process must also be given consideration. Truly optimal 
methods regard the graph G[V,A] as a toroid[3], wrapping around in both the horizontal and vertical directions 
. In this way, any point pj on the upper contour and qj on the lower can form the anchor span for the 
triangulation. An expedient alternative to such a procedure is to select that point on each contour having 
the minimum x value (in the transformed coordinate system) to be the endpoints of the anchor span. 4.3.4. 
Comparison of Methods Some very desirable features of this new heuristic become evident when it is compared 
to other methods. The most striking of its advantages is that, while per- forming computation using local 
information only, previous actions influence present decisions. Specifically, a local tri- angulation 
decision is based not only on the lengths of the contour segments involved, but also on the distance 
previ-ously traveled along each contour. It is a heuristic with memory, in contrast to all other heuristic 
methods hitherto published. The amount of contour preprocessing inherent to any method must also be considered. 
The complexity of such a step should not be dependent on any feature of a contour other than the number 
of points approximating it. If this is so, preprocessing may be done in one traversal of a contour, as 
it is with this new heuristic. However, the Keppel method, whose segmentation of a contour into concave 
and convex runs is a function not only of the number of points approximating a contour, but also of the 
shape of that contour, requires multi-pass preprocess-ing. Decomposition of a contour into concave and 
convex "runs" is a well-defined, but tedious operation. First, the convex hull enclosing a contour must 
be obtained by elim-inating concave segments. Then each of these concave segments must be recursively 
subdivided into convex sub-sets, each of which must be subdivided in turn, if neces- saP/. The Fuchs 
method, while being a truly optimal method requiring no special handling of contours, requires a large 
number of steps [3]+The number of steps is of the order of ~rnn [ log2m ] (m<n) and is bounded by ~log2m](2mn 
+ m) + 3ran + m 2. This is significantly more than the m+n steps required to tri- angulate a pair using 
heuristic methods, and hence is not appropriate for applications where speed is of primary importance. 
Finally, this new heuristic imposes no restriction on how contours must be oriented with respect to one 
another. The constraint of having contours mutually centered, or even parallel, is eliminated, for the 
triangulation decision is based solely on features of the contours themselves, and not on the spans between 
them. This is clearly an advantage, as non-parallel contours would be a more natural surface approximation 
than parallel contours for a large class of objects. Consider the object in Figure 8. The most natural 
cross-sectional description of it is a set of contours fanning out in constant incremental angle with 
respect to a pivot located at the base, as in Figure 8a. This new heuristic would function well without 
modification on such a set. However, all other existing triangulation methods would require a set of 
contours such as that of Figure 8b. If such contours were not chosen properly, the pivot point would 
be missed, producing a poor description (and image) of the object. 5. EXAMPLES Figure g illustrates a 
set of contours typical of a flaw volume produced during ultrasonic non-destructive evalua-tion in the 
laboratory. These contours are obtained by thresholding envelope detected data after it has been pro- 
cessed using a synthetic aperture[6]. The inter-contour separation is typically 1/S of a wavelength. 
This interval is approximately 0.0125" for lOMhz, sampling. Contours obtained in this manner exhibit 
close size and shape a. b. Figure 8.   Computer Graphics Volume 16, Number 3 July 1982 coherence, 
and are natural candidates for triangulation. A complete triangulation of the outer surface of this flaw 
as obtained with this new heuristic is shown in Figure 10. A shaded picture of the newly-acquired surface 
is shown in Figure 11. Another application of this method in NDE is triangula- tion between successive 
lines of a raster data grid [u.v,f(u.v)], as shown in Figures 12-14. A pseudo-color image of an XZ slice 
through an inspection volume, showing the front and back surface echoes, is given in Figure 12. Figures 
1 3 and 14 show the image of bottom-drilled holes in shading and pseudo-color, respectively. The shading 
in Fig- ure 1 a is based on unbiased gradient estimation[8]. Figures 11-14 were produced on a RAMTEK 
9351 (512 x 512 x 12) display controlled by a VAX 11/780 running UNIX. 6. CONCLUSIONS We have presented 
the general triangulation problem, and have presented a methodology for defining a class of J Figure 
9. solutions for the practical case of planar contours. A new heuristic incorporating memory features 
hitherto present only in so-called "optimal" algorithms has been described. Unlike the optimal methods, 
however, this new heuristic requires only m+n steps to triangulate a contour pair. This new heuristic 
has been shown to perform well in Non-destructive Evaluation, and it is believed it would work equally 
well in industrial vision systems using non-parallel contours. 7, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work has been
