Abtraet In this paper, a non-standard hybrid gestetic algtithm is presented. The appb is non-stsmdanl 
in that it violstes some efthe cotmtmt attributes asscchd with gestetic algorithms in the literature. 
The algorithm presented uses 10CSImaxima to locate the global maximum value uses haploid chmmwmes with 
domimmce mating instead of crmsover, generates me offspring IM set of parents, has no spec~]c mutation 
operator, and is designed for rapid convergence. wheat applied to an NP-Complete problem, the mstdts 
of this hybrid algorithm are shown to be vety successful in reducing the canplexity of the problem. Ilttrodtsetkn 
 The Crozzle is a ccmtest published monthly in the Australian Womens Weekly magazine. The contest is 
open to the residents of Australia and New Zealand. It is a crosswccd puzzle problem of enomtotts Compkxity 
[Fo92]. Due to the challenges -ted by ~S complexity several automated attempts at solving the puzzle 
have been made ~2, HA292]. None of the automated attempts, however, have been able to cottsktattly match 
the scores genesztted by the winning human contestants. As discussed below, the Crozz.le appears to be 
an NPQrnpkte probletm and as geaetic algorithms have shown much promise in dealing with such problems, 
a genetic ~ to the Croz.zle is lltis~dkcusses the unusual pmbkms presented by the Crozzle, and a hybrid 
genetic algorithm developed and implemented to &#38;crease the size of the input kxieon, thus reducing 
the size of the search space to be traversed. (For an overview cf gatetic algorithms see, e.g., [GG89].)

CrozAe Gessede A@rithm Hybrid genetic algorithms are genetic algorithms which do not directly solve the 
problem under consideration. l%ey can be viewed as two stage systems. The fwst stage, which contains 
the gcstetic algorithm! pre pucewes the data from the problem domain. lk output of the fmt wage is that 
used as input to the second stage. The second stage takes the pre-processed data and directly xks the 
pmbktm The approach used for the Cmvzzle is the Hybrid Crozsle Genetic Algorithm (HCGA). The HCGA has 
two parts just as has any hybrid genetic algtxitbm [GGS9]. TIE fmt stage is the Cmxz.le Genetic Algorithm 
(CGA). The second stage is the Crozzle Solver (CS) itself. l%e output of ti CGA is the data set which 
wiilbeused bythe second stage. Thisdata setis intendedto provide a smaller seach P for the second stage

atly the CGA portion of the HCGA. The CS pottion, its effiiestcy and success rates have been presented 
in detail ~viously ~. etc.]. The GlolMIMaxkmtm Scttrc The global msximum score for any one particular 
Crozr.le is currently an unknown quantity. To date, no report has ever been made of a score h@r than 
that published as a contest winner by the Australian W&#38;sert.r Wee&#38;ly. These published scores 
will be refereed to as the human winning solution (HWS) for any Cror.zle. No sutomated attempt has ever 
exceeded this scorn. Therefore, although still the subject of ongoing reseam~ for the present ptupmea, 
the global maximum score is considered to be the score published as the winning solution for a Cmzzle. 
We use the tam HWS brodly to represent the score achieved by the winning contestant as well as the word 
list used in that soluticm and the geometry constructed with that word list If the HWS is considered 
the global maximum solution, then, for every Cmzzle puzzle, it is known what the highest scat is, which 
subset of the word list was used, and what the geomeby for the global maximum is. This observation is 
impormnt as it aUowsthe CGAsmgeofthe HCGA to reevaluated independently of thesemnd stage CS. Ifthe CGAis 
ableto output a word list smalkx than the original tknadc liic without losing anyofthe words usedinthe 
HWS, then because of its properties itcanbe assumed thatthe CScxndd locate thecorrect highest scaing 
Cror.zle solution. DMirslltie!s withthe CrOzzle The Crozzle is an NP-Complete problem at two levels. 
Given the grid is originally empty, it is an NP-CompWe problem to geneme all the possible geometries 
(wind slots) fca tlw grid [GA79,p. 258]. once my giVtXl &#38;unetry is detemnin~ the second NP-Complete 
problem is to fill those .dors with words [GA79,p. 2S8]. That is, fcx each solution witbin tlM f­problem 
(locating the positions of the black quams) a separate N P-Complete problem (determmm g solutions within 
a specifii geometry of black and white squares) must also be solved. l%esize of theseach s~ for atypical 
Crozzle has been estimated to be approximately I@ nodes for a typicai input lexicon FG92]. This size, 
coupled with the fact that the fastest known implementation can process 2000 nodes per secon~ makes the 
Crozzle intractable for a ccsnplete Iraversal of the seamh space. This requires the use of heuristics 
which* large portions of the search space [see, e.g., SM89]. AIthough the geormmies and word lists of 
each Crozzle were analyzed as a pmursor to this project no consistent features were detected which could 
be univrxsally applied to the reduction of the search space. For example since the letter 77 results 
in the highest interlocking letter score+ it would seem the winning mlution should have interlocked 2 
s whenever words containing Z are present. This is M however, always the case, at least as far ss the 
HWS are concerned. Another observation thatcan be made isthat the winning solutions frequently have highly 
interlocked blccks in them, resulting in high interlocking letter scores in a relatively small portion 
of the grid. (Here, we introduce the taminology basii block to indicate a set of words interlocked such 
that the removal of any one of the words wotdd mwdt in an incomplete (and thus not legitimate) block.) 
Thii is one portion of the problem that has indeed yielded successfully to automation: the genaation 
of basic blocks has not only been implemented [W] butis significantly more efllcient and etkctive than 
htunsnts competitors. However, not tdl human Wi.DDii S&#38;ltiOnS CJX@D b8sic blocks and, indee4 of tlwse 
that do, very few contain the highest secring baAc bhck that exists within the Iexican.   ~AIgorlthms

genetic algorithms require l-e populadons and a large number of generations. With an expensive evaluation

CGAistodimctly reducetbe seamhsptwofthe Crozzle problem without losing the global maximum score, The 
technique used is that of reducing tbe size of the original thematic Wod list without ~uiredin tnmrning 
anyofthewds the HSW. Specifically, the CGA attempts to ehminate words with lengths sreater than5chamctas 
fmm the original wmd list. From ea@icai tests mthe CS, it basbeen determined xfwevery 5 words of length 
greatrr than 5 characters eliiated from the input word lis~ one order cf magtitude has been eliminated 
frmn tbe seamh space. For example eliminating 20 weds of this length, would reduce the overall search 
space by 4 orders ti dtude. Words withlengtbs shcrtex than6chamxers areused in the ~80ftheCG~ ~Y=Qot8m~~outPuL 
however. From interviews with some Crozzle contestants, it appears that short words (lengths of 3,4 
and 5) are used as links to piece together disjoint word groups while wo&#38;ng towti a solution. ~ plus 
the fact that 3 letter words can fit into any convenient Space atanypoint inthepmcesa to increase thetotalsccm, 
suggested that all the sheet wads should be available to tbe stage 2 (Cs) process. bn~ WCM dSare nxme 
moublesonx to pke, but are also mcm strategic, in the sense that theii pkement in the grid can be cncial 
in fitting an accqtable solution into the 15 by 10 quare grid. Ttw longer words obviously provide more 
possible interlock locations and, thus require mcxe processing per word than a shorter wofd. Therefore 
eliminating longer worda also reduces rtmre of the seamh -e thM does the elimination of a shcxter Wd. 
As a result of these observations and interviews, it was decided to ignore tmy attemfxs by the CGA to 
trim 3,4, and 5 letter words h the wcd list. Althcmgh tbeae shorter words are available to the CGA while 
evaluating the c~ they are n~ subject to eliminadon as are the long= words in the list, and are always 
available to stage 2 of tk HCGA. Nmtmukd Operatomintbe CGA Sii the CGA is geared towards rapid convexgmce, 
the operators involved were IHMsarily altered accordingly. The two pm most ~=ted m those Of IX?@UCtiOIIand 
lXO$SOV~. Mutation, a common ~ in most genetic algorithms, was not used for the tests repmted here. l%e 
normal behavicx of reproduction is to select those chmmmoms &#38;an the population which will survive 
to the next generation for mating. The canmcm methods used for this m amstochastic sampling with replacement, 
and stochastic SSI@iI18with -al mplacemen~ although other methods exist [BA87J Tlwse methods gcmrally 
try to assure that each chmmoame gels its fair repmacnration in the next genrmtion. In the CCL%however, 
it is impemtbm+ due to the small number of generations which can be pmcewed, that convergence to a maximum 
lw rapid. To assist rapid convcq~ the CGA reproduction opemtor assures that every high quality individual 
survives into the next generation. The CGA detemines tbe highest fitness score in the entire populadon. 
Allchmommm wirhtbat score are automatid y canied over to the next generation. The balance cf thepopuladonforthe

each having the gened of Oru cbmmmmx fmmoneparent up to the crossover site combd with the genes of the 
second parent after the crossovcx site. For example, given the two chmmomea X and Y, below, represented 
in binaty form and the crossover site 4, therealdtingoffspringx andY areshown. X=111111 y.~ X=lllloo 
Y =(NX)O11 (hssover in the CGA uses I@oid (single strand) chmmmmes but kl OwS fmrn the diploid (dual

Wh they are SCtUSlly mated, only a single offs~ng is prod~ having the most dominant gene in every prmition 
tkom the two parents. For example, if two chmnmmms X and Y existed with5genes, andthedominance values 
for each gene were as shown below, the single offspring Z would be produced with the &#38;minamx values 
shown. ~= 1040457621 Y =322044S020 z = 3240458021 Since in position 1, the ~ gene was dominant (with 
the higher value of 32), it would be carried on to Z in position 1. In position 2, the X gene is dominant 
(with the higher value of 40), Soitwould becamiedontoz and soon. The dominant e factm used is called 
Average Potential Word Score (APWS) which is the sum of the letter values in the word represented, divided 
by the word s length. This function was selected as a large @on &#38; the words in the Crozzle word lists 
with high APWS are generally used in the wiming solution.  The changes in tbe crossover and qwoduction 
opemtom are the primary diatinguiahing featumaofthe CG4 andproved tobe Crucial to the success of the 
project. Whm the normal implementations of these operators were used, results, although better than a 
purely random appcodh were not sufficiently refried to be conaidemd successful. The possibility, if not 
the probability,exists that this Ixk d success could be directly tied tothesmallpopulationsize andthesmall 
numberofgenerations. These parameteraihowever, as dkcuased above, were relatively freed. fherefme, * 
operatm themselves needed to be changed to WCd within the freed parameters of popukticm size and number 
of generations. Implementation The implementaticm issues involved in the CGA revolve strongly around 
the neceaaity of converging rapidly to soluticma. As discussed, the operators were altered ft ull their 
normal behttviw. Asevere hnitwasre quiredon bothpopulation aize and the numbex c# generations which could 
be pmcesed. Externally imposed constraints were that the CGA run on machines readily available (10 netwakd 
N= computers), and finish in leas than24hours. Due to the procdng time fequired forwodlists of any substantial 
leng@ the CGA attempts to fmd a series of local maxima involving short wcsxi lists. when a local maximum 
is found, the word list producing that local maximum is recorded. Attheend of theentire process, all 
the word lists producedby local maxima are combiied. Thii cambined list is the output of the CGA and 
would be the input to stage 2 (CS). The opemtion ia as follows: l) Tenword lists amrandomly generated 
fromthethemadc word list, Mh of the ten word lists contains approximately23 WtXdS(duplication is dbved

list which repmaenta the highes scoring chmmmome in the population over the 15 generations. These word 
lists am combined without duplication into the GA8 master list. 3) Tat new word lists are generated as 
in step 1. 4) Ten new instances of the CGA p ocess the ten new word liStS. Each of these illSWiCC9(called

was retained in 9 &#38; the 10 Crozr.lea. Grdy January 1992 did not succeed axordiig to this criteri~ 
missiig a single word. Thii means that the original ida nf combining the two master lists into a Union 
List resulted ina90% success rate. The GA8 master lists, by themselves, retained the global maximum in 
7 of 10 Crozzles. I&#38; GA1O master lists did the same. Therefore, ewt sepamtely, the master lists each 
retained the global maximum 70% of the time. The imptance of these results, howevex, lies in the numbex 
of words eliminated from the word list while retaining those words in the global maximum. From empirical 
tests [IU92], it has been determined that, for each 5 weds eliminated, one order of magnitude has been 
eliminated frcin the search space. By looking at Table 2, the number of words eliminated can be seen. 
Gn the July 1991 Crozz.le, for example, GAS retained the global maximum while ~g approximately 30 words 
from the wmd list. This results in 6 orders of magnitude smaller search space. GA10, for titober 1989, 
retained the global maximum while trimming nearly 50 words, or 10 orders of magnitude, from the search

rates of the GA8 and GA1O master lists may prove to be more valuable than the 90% success rate of the 
Union List in practice. Each of these lists is obviously shorter or equal to the Union List in length, 
and therefore, results in a smaller search space. If tbe 70% retention rate of the global maximum is 
wceptable to the user, then a more vigorous search may be done ovtr the smalJer seamh spaces, providing 
a greater chance of locating the maximum within that space. If the maximum is located, the test results 
indicate a 70% chance that the maximum of that space is, in fiwt the global maximum for the. entire word 
lisL As shown, tbe average was approximately 35 words trimmed fturn the word list, resulting in an estimated 
7 orders of msgnitude smaller search space for stage 2. These huge gains in efficiency allow the stage 
2 portion to do tighter traversals of the seamh space than before without losing the global maximum acme 
in the process. Conduzdon and Future Reaearcb A genetic algorithm for an NP-Complete problem known as 
the Crozzle has been presatted which makes use of rapid convergence along with unusual variants of the 
reproduction and crossover operators. The lack of art inexpensive evaluation function for the genetic 
algorithm required that small populations and few genemtions be procd. Fa the same reason, a series of 
lad maxima were collected and combkd to attempt the generation of the global maximum score from the search 
space. The hybrid CGA retained the global maximum score 90% of the time. More impnrtdy, the smaller GA8 
and GA1O master lists retained the global maximum scorn 70% of the time while eliminating approximately 
7 ordcm of magnitude from the overall seamh space. Ilis reduction, combined with other heuristics in 
the stage 2 portion d the hybrid CGA allow for much fuller traversals of the enormous smvh space. At 
least two avenues nf future research directly involving the Cmzzle are suggested by the success of this 
project. First, the number of instances of both GA8 and GA1O were determined by the hardware resounxa 
available. It is unknown bow changing the number of instances would atkt the results and what the optimal 
number of such instanca might be. Second, through empirical analysis, it cart be determined, without 
even ruining the CGA that certain Crozzle wotd lists are not likely to be successfully timmed. These 
predestined failures relate directly to the number of 3.4, and 5 letter wads in the original input wcxd 
lisL even thnugh such words are not subject to pruning by the CGA. Various attempts to solve this particular 
problem have failed to date. At the preaertt time, the explanation for this phenomenon has not been detenninexl
