classification This poster presents experimental results of three face recognition methods Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP)-based, and Sparse Represented-based Classification (SRC). We 
will show the experimental results based on AR face database and on home photos. The experiments show 
that the three algorithms can achieve over 85% recognition rate in AR database. However, the recognition 
rate is extremely reduced in home photos. SVM and SRC-based method encounter challenges of selecting 
training model while LBP-based method encounters the challenge of merging over scattered clusters. Our 
goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency especially in home photos based on the three methods. 
Researches on face recognition have been presented in many publications. SVM-based face recognition has 
been introduced by Jonathon s work [1]. In our implementation, 87 feature points extracted from each 
image are SVM training data. Afterwards, face images are classified by SVM with trained model. In the 
future, an automatic face alignment step with Bayesian Tangent Shape Model (BTSM) will be adopted [2]. 
LBP-based face recognition was proposed in [3]. The LBP operator assigns a label to every pixel of an 
image by thresholding the 3x3 neighborhood of each pixel with the center pixel value and considering 
the result as a binary number. Then the histogram of the labels is used as a texture descriptor. For 
face images, each image is partitioned into several regions and LBP histograms are combined as the face 
descriptor. Weighted chi square static is used to classify faces into groups. LBP-based face recognition 
method has been proven to be robust to illumination changes. SRC-based face recognition was proposed 
by Wright et al. in 2008 [4]. The basic idea of SRC indicates that the new face image is a linear combination 
of images in the face database and the coefficients are sparse since non-zero coefficients are only contributed 
by face images of the same individual. Based on the sparse representation computed by L1-minimization, 
the face classification algorithm is proposed. The major advantage of SRC-based algorithm is robust to 
occlusions AR face database and home photos are both tested with the three algorithms. In AR database, 
881 frontal face images from 120 subjects are selected. Each subject has 6 or 7 images. For one subject, 
4 out of 7 images are used as training data (480 images in total) while the others are used as testing 
data (401 images in total). The table listed below shows the results. Runtime of image normalization 
and alignment excludes the training time and testing time. Table 1 Results on AR database Algorithm Recognition 
Rate Training Time Testing Time SVM 87.5% 255.2s 1.1s LBP 94.0% 52.3s 58.5s SRC 89.7% - 2147.4s  
Home photos with 334 face images from 5 subjects are selected to test the three algorithms. Experiments 
are separated into two parts, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, 
SVM-based algorithm is excluded since our face alignment module is currently inefficient in handling 
non-frontal faces. The results are shown in Table 2. The recognition rate of SRC-based algorithm is reduced 
15.1% to 74.6%, while that of LBP-based algorithm is reduced 23.8% to 70.2%. Table 2 Results on home 
photos (supervised learning) Algorithm Recognition Rate Training Time Testing Time LBP 70.2% 11.1s 16.5s 
 SRC 74.6% - 442.2s  Unsupervised learning means that the algorithm classifies faces into clusters by 
its own decision. Only LBP-based algorithm is available for unsupervised learning in our implementation. 
Table 3 shows the results. The error rate grows while reducing the number of clusters. The same experiment 
is also performed on Google Picasa Web Album, which gives 100% accuracy with 117 clusters. Table 3 LBP-based 
algorithm on home photos (unsupervised learning) Clusters 328 314 262 191 Accuracy 100% 99% 95% 83% 
 The improvement in recognizing home photos can focus on illumination normalization, face alignment, 
and runtime. High speed with some user-aided improvement of recognition rate is preferred in our future
