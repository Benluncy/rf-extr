1A4 1 Introduction Distributed systems are rapidly becoming the most prevalent form of computing today. 
As large-scale dis­ tributed systems become more common, distributed file systems are faced with the 
challenge of providing ef­ ficient service in systems with hundreds, or even thou­ sands, of hosts. The 
performance of techniques for man­ aging resources in large-scale distributed systems are largely dependent 
on the workload of the system. In this paper, we present the results of a workload study conducted in 
a large-scale distributed industrial environment. This environment consists of several thou­sand workstations/users 
organized into project-oriented workgroups connected together by a hierarchy of local area and wide area 
networks and spread across several metropolitan areas. The primary activity of the users in this environment 
is software development. This case study examines the file system activity of users involved in the development 
of one large software product. In this subsystem, there are about 75OO users organized into over one 
hundred workgroups, with each workgroup comprising 20-25 workstations and a file server con­nected by 
a local area network. The type of clustering of workstations (into workgroups) found in this environ­ment 
is typical of large-scale distributed environments. In the workload study presented here, we focus exclu­sively 
on inter-cluster, or inter-workgroup, file system activity. Due to the nature of the environment, we 
are lim­ited in this study to using high level measurement tools that do not modify the operating/file 
system and do not interfere in any way with the normal use of the system. The result is that this study 
characterizes file accesses at a coarse granularity, at the level of whole files accessed Permission

types of files that are analyzed in this study: source files and object files. Source files contain program 
source code, and ob­ject files are compiled binary files. Source files are both read and write accessed 
by users, while object tiles are only read accessed. Other types of files exist within the system but 
are not captured in this study because they are accessed only from within a workgroup.  2 Measurements 
The measurements presented in this paper show a num­ber of significant differences from those of past 
work­load studies conducted in academic environments (for instance, [2]). The following table shows the 
static file system attributes: ( File l#of size distribution 1% Type files mean 50th% 90th% active Source 
63,052 29.7 1 12.0 72.0 37.4 Object 366)943 24.9 12.0 66.5 4.0 Files are much larger in size compared 
to files found in academic environments, The fraction of files that are active during a series of l-week 
study periods is rela­tively high too. However, as in past study environments, the fraction of files 
that are modified is relatively low (10-12% for source files). It was found that the files that have 
been accessed during the study period have higher average sizes than those that were not accessed. The 
size distribution of active files is shown in Figure 1, which shows that the average size of write-active 
source files is larger than that of read-active source files, An examination of the file sharing characteristics 
between workgroups shows that there is a significant amount of sharing of files. Figure 2 shows that 
50-60~0 of the source files and 4070 of the object files are shared by two or more workgroups. Shared 
source files are found to be relatively unsta­ble, being modified on a daily or weekly basis. This is 
in stark contrast to earlier studies which have found sharing limited to read-only system files. This

sharing can be attributed to the collective project-oriented na­ture of industrial environments in general, 
as opposed to academic environments where users tend to, work on individual projects and rarely share 
data. Figure 3 shows that 50% of the write active source files are shared among two or more workgroups. 
However, files that are shared among a large number of workgrotlps ac­count for a smaller fraction of 
writes and receive fewer updates. In other words, as the sharing level increases the updates to the file 
decrease. 55- . . . . . . . % of write active files (avg: 2.3) 50. ------+ % of total updates 4s 443

from academic environments. The large-scale and extensive inter-workgroup sharing of user files in the 
system are some of the key differences. Files are gener­ally larger in size and are extensively read-write 
shared in comparison to small files (few Kbytes) and negligi­ ble read-write sharing reported by academic 
workload studies. This workload study is complementary to existing studies in two senses. First, it 
looks at a large dis­tributed industrial environment, rather than an aca­ demic or small industrial environment. 
Second, it fo­ cuses on cluster level characteristics, rather than those of individual workstations in 
small clusters. Our obser­vations are in many ways consistent with existing ones, suggesting that many 
characteristics at individual work­station level recurs at cluster level. On the other hand, new characteristics 
emerge at the cluster level. Our work therefore adds an important piece to the overall puzzle of distributed 
file system workload characterization. References <RefA>[1]<SinRef><author>Deepinder S Gill</author>, <author>Songnian Zhou</author>, <author>Harjinder S Sandhu</author>,
