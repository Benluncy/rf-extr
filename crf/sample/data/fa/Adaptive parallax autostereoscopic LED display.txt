 Shigeki Imai Sharp Corporation Osaka, Japan imai.shigeki@sharp.co.jp Introduction Autostereoscopic 
3D displays using static parallax barrier or lenticular lens are commercially available in these days. 
In these methods, however, the number of viewpoints is fixed at the time of manufacturing. Active parallax 
barrier [Perlin, 2000] anddynamic parallax barrier [Peterka, 2008] have been proposed toimprove the resolution 
and number of viewpoints by moving theposition of the parallax barriers. To implement an autostereoscopic 
display, with dynamic parallax barriers, dual­layered LCD panel is a common approach as is mentioned 
by [Hirsch, 2010]. And a method of optimizing the parallax barriers [Lanman, 2010] has been proposed 
to represent more perceptually-acceptable imagery. Remaining limitations of thedual-layered LCD method 
are the refresh rate and brightness of the LCD panel. Commonly used high-speed LCD has 120Hz in refresh 
rate and around 500cd/m2 in brightness so that conventional systems did not have enough quality to be 
used in public. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive parallax autostereoscopic display composed 
of a high-density/high­frequency LED panel and a high-speed/high-contrast LCD panel. Implementation 
!!We implemented a novel 38inch high-density LED panel that has 240Hz refresh rate and 1500cd/m2 brightness. 
More than 160,000full-color LEDs are arranged on the panel with 1.5mm pitch. A moving image rendered 
on the basis of a particular parallax barrier pattern is displayed on the LED display, and a 240Hz VAtype 
LCD panel with HD resolution, which works as dynamic parallax barrier, is placed in front of the LED 
panel. The distance between the LED panel and LCD panel is 45mm and both theimages on the LED and the 
LCD panels are displayedsynchronously. Consequently, appropriate rays of light aredelivered to each viewpoint 
as shown in Figure 2. As the barrier pattern can be varies arbitrarily, the number and direction of motion 
parallax can be flexibly controlled according to theviewer s condition. Figure 3. (Left) Construction 
of the 3D display using a LED panel as light source and a LCD panel as dynamic parallax barrier. (Right) 
Our developed high-density LED module When a viewer stands in front of the display, the systemrecognizes 
the rough position of the viewer s head by a camera,and then the viewpoints are densely arranged around 
the viewer shead so as to maximize the range of the horizontal motion parallax. When the viewer lies 
down in front of the display, the parallax would automatically changed to vertical. Further, when there 
are multiple users in front of the display, the number and angle of horizontal parallax would be changed 
according to the distribution of the people. This proposed system enhances the viewing style of 3DTV 
from individual use as gaming to public use as digital signage. References <RefA><SinRef><author>Perlin, K., </author><author>Paxia, S. </author>and
