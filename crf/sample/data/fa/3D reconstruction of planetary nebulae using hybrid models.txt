astrophysical objects like planetary nebulae can normally only be observed from a single point of view, 
which makes deduc­ing plausible 3D models a hard task that usually involves a lot of manual work [Nadeau 
et al. 2001]. However, additional physical assumptions can be used in order to estimate the missing depth 
in­formation. In previous work [Wenger et al. 2009], a certain axial symmetry was assumed which is present 
in many planetary nebu­lae, so that tomographic methods could be used for the reconstruc­tion. However, 
this assumption obviously fails for many of the most complex and interesting objects in question, and 
it only leads to un­ambiguous results as long as no absorption occurs within the neb­ula. Our new approach 
models the underlying physics of planetary neb­ulae more closely by making use of the fact that they 
often consist of nested gaseous clouds or shells which contain the remains of sub­sequent eruptions of 
a dying star. Within such a cloud, the volume is likely to homogeneously emit light due to recombination 
pro­cesses in the ionized gas, while the surfaces of each cloud may con­tain dust or debris that can 
either absorb radiation that was emitted elsewhere or be excited to emit additional radiation by themselves. 
While off-line renderings of such phenomena have been feasible in the past [Baranoski and Rokne 2006], 
our work deals with the prob­lem of creating suitable models using a minimum amount of user interaction, 
and of visualizing the results interactively. 2 Our Approach As a .rst step, the geometry of the different 
shells has to be speci­.ed. Since the identi.cation of a shell in a planetary nebula usually involves 
a lot of physical reasoning, this task cannot be entirely au­tomatized. However, software can assist 
the user in various ways in this initial step, depending on the amount of control the user *e-mail: wenger@cg.cs.tu-bs.de

to exercise. Either an entire mesh can be created using suit­able modeling software, or only the outlines 
of distinct objects are traced by the user, while our program automatically generates a smooth closed 
mesh satisfying the given border conditions, similar to some 3D drawing tools, e.g. [Igarashi et al. 
1999]. As soon as the geometry of the model is determined, the volume emission density of each mesh can 
be estimated so that the average squared difference between the volume-rendered model and the ob­served 
image is minimized. Then, the surface emission and absorp­tion layers have to be determined. Since this 
problem is inherently ambiguous, it is further constrained by demanding that each surface layer is self-consistent, 
that is, it has a unique texture that does not change throughout the layer. We achieve this by taking 
a sample of each surface layer in a region where no other layers are present and by extrapolating this 
sample into the rest of the layer using a texture synthesis method. The residual intensity can .nally 
be distributed among the layers without disturbing the visual continuity. The resulting models are rendered 
at interactive frame rates using a depth peeling algorithm for depth-sorting of surface layers and volume 
rendering techniques for the volumetric and surface effects (Figure 1). References <RefA><SinRef><author>BARANOSKI, G. V.
