 Accurate Skin Deformation Model of Forearm Using MRI Kentaro Yamanaka. Shinsuke Nakamura Shota Kobayashi 
Waseda University 1 Introduction This paper presents a new methodology for constructing a skin deformation 
model using MRI and generating accurate skin de­formations based on the model. Many methods to generate 
skin deformations have been proposed and they are classified into three main types. The first type is 
anatomically based modeling. Anatomically accurate deformations can be reconstructed but computation 
time is long and controlling generated motion is difficult. In addition, modeling whole body is very 
difficult. The second is skeleton-subspace deformation (SSD). SSD is easy to implement and fast to compute 
so it is the most common tech­nique today. However, accurate skin deformations can t be easily realized 
with SSD. The last type consists of data-driven ap­proaches including example-based methods. In order 
to construct our model from MRI images, we employ an example-based method. Using examples obtained from 
medical images, skin deformations can be modeled related to skeleton motions. Retar­geting generated 
motions to other characters is generally difficult with this kind of methods. Kurihara and Miyata realize 
accurate skin deformations from CT images [Kurihara et al. 2004], but it doesn t mention the possibility 
of retargeting. With our model, however, generated deformations can be retargeted. Once the model is 
constructed, accurate skin deformations are easily gener­ated applying our model to a skin mesh. In our 
experiment, we construct a skin deformation model which reconstructs pronosu­pination, rotational movement 
of forearm, and we use range scan data as a skin mesh to apply our model and generate accurate skin deformations. 
 2 Image Acquisition One healthy adult male subject underwent the MRI scanning. MRI scans containing 
thin axial slices were obtained. The slice thick­ness was 5 [mm] and the pixel size was 1.0*1.0 [mm]. 
We meas­ured a right arm and forearm with three postures, pronated, supi­nated, and intermediate position 
(Figure 1). The subject was at­tached markers while the scanning. Markers were also attached while range 
scanning was performing. 3 Modeling We model skin deformations on those of contours of forearm ex­tracted 
from MRI images. In our experiment, the contours are extracted by means of snake [Kass et al. 1988]. 
Several feature points are set on MRI images. Using these feature points, a local coordinate system and 
rotation angle . are defined. The local coordinate system normalizes postures as a common criterion and 
rotation of upper arm is also normalized with this coordinate sys­tem. Because . is rotation angle by 
which the radius spins around the head of the ulna, it is an indicator of relative motion of radius and 
ulna. The radius is the forearm bone of the hand and it runs along the thumb side of the forearm. By 
contrast, the ulna is the forearm bone of the elbow and it runs along the little finger side. After normalization, 
each set of contours of an example pos­ture is related to . . Deformations are linearly interpolated 
with . for pronation and supination phase respectively. For this in- .email: kentaro.05-27@suou.waseda.jp

Pronosupination (left: supinated position, meddle: intermediate position, right: pronated position) terpolation, 
registration within several examples is estimated from movement of markers attached while MRI scanning. 
We define this interpolated deformation of contours as the skin deformation model. Accurate skin deformations 
are realized applying this model to forearms of characters. 4 Generating Skin Deformations Fitting our 
model to a skin mesh is based on the markers attached while MRI and range scanning. Then, accurate skin 
deformations are generated by means of RBF: N (1) v'=.{Wk f(xk - v )} k=1 where N is a number of vertices 
on our model, v is vertex posi­tion on a skin mesh, v' is deformed vertex position and xk is the position 
of vertex k on our model at an intermediate position. We use f= x2 +s 2 as the basis function. s is the 
minimum distance between the vertex k and another vertex on our model. In order to calculate a weight 
Wk, we solve Equation (1) where the position of vertex i on our model at an intermediate position ( xi 
) and at an arbitrary position ( x' i ) are used instead of v and v' respectively. The result is shown 
in Figure 1. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a method for constructing a skin deformation model from MRI 
images and generating accurate skin deformations with the model was explained. We show the capability 
of our model by generating highly realistic motions using range scan data not only of the subject who 
underwent MRI scanning but of two more male as shown in a video. However, generating accurate pronosupina­tion 
of females or children may be difficult with this model be­cause we use MRI images obtained from one 
male subject. In order to construct a universal skin deformation model, it is neces­sary to increase 
data. Modeling accuracy should be improved to realize more accurate skin deformations. References <RefA><SinRef><author>KASS,
