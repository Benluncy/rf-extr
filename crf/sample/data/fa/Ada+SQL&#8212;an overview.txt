environment for Ada capabilities available cover about 90% of the core language 95 extended with basic 
SQL single user specification. In addition, a set of packages have been capabilities. It incorporates 
a very fast compiler added to easy programming tasks such as screen and 2D and interpreter, with debugging 
options, library basic grap~cs operations. A MS-DOS console controlled generator and browser, syntax 
template editors, by the PE carries out compilation and execution of programmer wizard, two-dimensional 
graphics, programs, including SQL commands. The compiler and SQL interactive interface and hypertext 
interpreter are assembled into one independent 32 bits program. Therefore, it is also possible to compile

components include the usual basic modules such that scanner, parser, symbol table management, error 
handling, and intermediate code generation. Besides these components a library module keeps track of 
source files and the program units they contain. The library manager tells the compiler the source file 
that contains a given program t, nit such that a package. A source file may contain any number of program 
units. For instance, when a compilation A finds a with clause that refers to a package P, the compilation 
makes a pause with the current source file, a. A new compilation, B, is started to process source file, 
b, which contains package P. When compilation B concludes, then compilation A resumes now accumulating 
the program units stored in source files b and partially a. Therefore, no intermediate code is ever stored. 
Only source code is used. 4.1 Scanner Lexical analysis operates mostly under parser's conlrol. Some 
subprograms belonging to predefined packages also use some scanner operations at run-time. To increase 
compiler speed, the entire source file is read into a memory buffer by one low-level input system call. 
A token look- ahead buffer of varying length is used to provide the parser with a means of inspecting 
the source code in order to identify specific language constructs. Examples of such constructs are aggregates 
and SQL commands. The use of context clauses and generic units cause the parser to switch its focus 
among a number of source files. Subprograms that store all scanner information into its local storage 
are used to deal with this problem. The scanner parameters are then initialized with the information 
needed to compile the new coming compilation and the parser is then called to act on it. When the parser 
returns these subprograms restore the scanner information with the previously saved local storage allowing 
the parser to resume its work with the source file that caused this type of action. 4.2 Parser Syntax 
analysis is performed by a recursive descendant parser (k) where k stands for any number of look-ahead 
tokens. As pointed out before, language constructs such as aggregates and SQL commands require a number 
of look- ahead tokens in order to be identified properly. SQL commands are parsed by context. SQL commands 
may be also coded anywhere an Ada statement is allowed. As mentioned before, instantiation of generic 
units cause the parser to save the scanner state and redirect its input to the generic unit components 
making text replacements among generic formal parameters and generic actual parameters. Internal code 
generated is associated with information on both source file and line number that originated each instruction 
(see figure 7). When either a compile or run- time error is detected this information is used to report 
the exact error location. The SQL select command was extended to allow, as an option, the inclusion of 
a block statement. Each time a select command retrieves data, that satisfy a where clause when present, 
the block statement is executed. 4.3 Symbol Table The symbol table uses a nested hash table scheme. Each 
compiler instance contains a global hash table. Program units such that packages, main programs and SQL 
tables are common entries within this scope. These types of entries have descendant hash tables. For 
instance, a descendant hash table for a procedure will contain all elements that belong to its declarative 
part. Figure 6 shows the symbol table representation considering the compilation for the code fragment 
within figure 5. An outer square represents a scope. Each scope contains 20 fields. Only two of these 
fields are being shown: the father and the bucket vector. The father field stores a pointer to the ancestor 
scope. Each bucket entry points to a linked list of table entries that share the same hash value. Figure 
6-(a) shows the entries Ada and ST. A full symbol table entry contains 65 fields from which many are 
pointers into other data structures. Only two of these fields are being shown:/d and son. The id field 
stores the characters that represent the symbol. Names, all forms of literals and temporaries are common 
symbol table entries. The son field stores a pointer into its descendant scope for entries like packages 
subprograms and records. Figure 6-(b) shows the descendant scope for procedure ST. Figure 6-(c) shows 
the descendant scope for package Ada. Experiments have shown that this structure is responsible for part 
of the compiler speed. w~:h Ada.Text_IO; uee Acla.Text_IO; pEOC~Et ST ~S ~=yIMn Date As .t'm~O~l. Month

and des.laction, line. text~ pixel, ellipse and circle. It uses the Windows MFC CDialog and CDC classes 
from a console application. Other complementary MPC classes are also used. These resources and related 
types are accessed from Ada programs by using the implementation-defined package Windows_2D. 5. INTERPRETER 
The symbol table and the intermediate code represent any set of compiled program units. This representation 
together with a non empty set of run-time stacks are used by the Ada+SQL abstract machine which is implemented 
by an interpreter. Each task and protected units have their own stack. The tasking model implementation 
uses a round robing scheduler. The user can change the quantum as a way of experimenting different concurrent 
program behavior. When a dead state is detected among a set of tasks these tasks are placed in the abnormal 
state and the exception Tasking_Error is raised. The stack model is used as the run time storage management 
strategy. Two exceptions are the allocation of dynamic memory, requested explicitly by the programmer, 
and the occurrence of unconstrained arrays. For instance, the bounds of an unconstrained array declared 
within a subprogram may be taken from parameters. Only when such subprogram is executed the array storage 
area is allocated. These arrays make use of descriptors that point to memory allocated from the heap. 
Special memory controls are used to avoid memory leaks when a block containing such arrays leaves the 
stack. Aria 95 and SQL commands are interpreted as the same level. The current version treats tables 
as independent disk files with special headers that contain information on tuple utilization. 6. Aria 
95 &#38; SQL CONSTRUCTS Most core conslructs of Ada 95 are operational. Variant parts, access to subprogram 
definition, dynamic dispa¢l~ng, abstract types and subprograms, named array aggregates, user-defined 
assignment and finalization, requeue statements, asynchronous "ansfer of control, shared variables, praginas 
and a number of attributes are cons~'uets under implementation. SQL commands available are create, insert, 
update, select, delete, alter and drop. 7. DOCUMENTATION Full hypertext documentation is provided on 
the environment, the Ada 95 Referenc~ Manual V. 6.0, SQL. In addition, a tutorial on basic Ada 95 is 
also provided. The E95.I-ILP compressed file is accessed from within the PE and also fTom the winhelp 
utility program. 8. PERFORMANCE Running the compiler/interpreter on a COMPAQ Presario 300MHz under Windows 
98 with 502 Ada source files, where some sources contain more than one program unit, with a total of 
61,000 LOC.s takes less than two minutes to compile and interprete. A few of these programs use delay 
statements which increased the overall elapsed time. 9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Ada+SQL has been 
used as a tool to assist novice programmers enrolled in Data Smlcmres and Concurrency classes for several 
years at undergrsduate CS programs in the "Universidade Luterana do Brasil" located in the cities of 
Canoas and Gravataf both within the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Students' reactions indicate 
that Ada+SQL has been helpful to them. Future work will continue to implement additional Ada 95 and SQL 
consu'ucts as well as improving the PE. Special attention is being given to incorporate some Visual Basic 
features that could make its usage easier as well as CGI capability. Version 3.0 of Ada+SQL will be distributed 
upon request for a limited period of time. 10. REFERENCES <RefA>[1] <SinRef><author>Hawryszkiewycz, I. T.</author> <title>Database Analysis
