of large cDNA clone hbranes based on ohgonucleotide fingerprints The goal of most large-scale EST projects 
is the generaUon of a umque set of sequences describing either the complete gene set (OFPs). The main 
advantage of this technique lies m that, of an organism or the subset of genes being expressed m awithout 
sequencing, each clone is tagged in an almost unique specific ussue or developmental stage. Most of the 
EST dataway, which has a couple of interesting apphcauons, e.g. pubhshed so far origanate from human

which reflects the number of different genes being expressed in the respective tissue and their relative 
abundance as well, should be in the order of 100,000-200,000 cloned sequences (clones). Therefore the 
analysis-tools we 165 developed and employ are designed to cope with very large data- sets and therefore 
most data-production steps, e.g. p~cking, spotting and amplification of clones have been automated to 
a high degree [6,10-13] The clones are amphfied by PCR, immobilized on nylon-filter membranes (approx. 
25,000 different clones per filter) and hybridized m parallel to a radioactively labeled oligomer probe 
of known sequence. After a scanning procedure ~mage analys~s evaluates the hybridization experiment by 
assigning each clone a numerical value that is proportional to the amount of bound radioacuvely labeled 
probe. By repeating this experiment with a set of different probes (200-300) each clone is described 
by a characteristic vector of numerical values -its fingerprint. Detailed protocols of the procedure 
have been published recently [14-16]. Once the OFPs for a cDNA library are generated no additional hybridization 
steps are necessary, which is a clear advantage over subtraction methods. Based on the OFP information 
all clones from a library, or even clones from different libraries, can be clustered with specialized 
algorithms, and sequencing ns performed only for one representative clone per cluster to generate a low 
redundant EST set, which saves a lot of sequencing efforts. Besides the economical aspects OFPs can be 
used at later stages of a project to identify clones similar to an already sequenced one, which nught 
help in getting full length cDNA sequences from single EST data, or might provide an easy way to generate 
sub-hbraries for specific genes or gene famlhes. The latter will be of great importance in ongoing projects 
for gene expression profiling. Finally, data base mining for a specific clone can be performed without 
sequencing, just based on the OFP, since the sequences of the matching oligos is known. By that techmque 
~t could be possible to exclude known, highly expressed genes" a priori from any sequencing step, or 
to find novel genes in a directed manner. B]onnformatncs is an indispensable Ingredient in the OFP method, 
and in section 2 we will outhne the basic algorithms and software tools used in our department. In section 
3 selected results are presented, and in section 4 we describe very recent results and g~ve some prospect 
to interesting future applications. I lmalgÂ¢ mmly~ I t fcpr t~eeu ~ cD~ i~ I-110~ tlCt~ ~ Nter = Fmrl~r

description of the'relevant components ~s gaven in the following subsections 2.1. Selection of probes 
The crucial assumption of the OFP-approach ~s that the fingerprint ~s characteristic for the individual 
clone sequence although there ~s a certain loss m information by representing sequences by fingerprints. 
However, by using a large number of probes that differ enough among their sequences we think that tins 
assumption ~s justified. The choice of probe sequence-length (essentmlly octamers m our case) ~s a trade-off 
between matching frequency, which ~s high for short probes, and experimental stabdlty of the match, wh=ch 
is h=gh for long probes. In general probes should have a good experimental quahty and high matching rates. 
We estimate that the number of positive s~gnals of the probes in use is between (5%-20%). Addmonally 
probes should be selected m a way that the d~scnminat~on of cDNA sequences is good. For that reason an 
algorithm has been ~mplemented (A.Schmm, pers. comm.) that selects a set of probes according to ~ts ability 
to partition a training set of sequences m an opumal way using entropy as quahty criterion. G~ven a set 
S of probes to select from: 1.) Start with the probe m S that best partitions the training set mto 2 
groups. 2.) G~ven a selected set of k probes that best partitions the training set into 2 k parts, add 
to the hst the probe that together w=th the prewously chosen probes -best partitions the training set 
into 2 TM parts using the entropy of the partitions as quahty criterion 3.) Stop ff k exceeds a certain 
number. This procedure leads to a set of probes that ~s highly mformat=ve for d~scnmmatmg the training 
set Therefore it ~s recommended to use different probe sets when analyzing e g. hbranes from different 
orgamsms. 2.2. Image Analysis Rehable ~mage analysis is a fundamental component of the p~pehne Global 
and local rotations of the filter w~thm the ~mage must be detected and a very dense agglomeration of 
spots on the filter must be detected. To help data analysis clones are spotted m a rectangular grid of 
blocks each of which contains the same number of clones, and a so-called grade spot, Le. a spot that 
originates from a pool of salmon sperm DNA that hybridizes to all probes, ~s spotted at the center of 
each block. Clones are spotted mult=ple times (twice in this example) to allow quality control procedures 
winch assess the reproducibihty of the hybrtd~zatmn. The whole filter contains 2,304 different blocks 
which corresponds to 57,600 spots that have to be quantified. A total of 27,648 different cDNA clones 
are immobd=zed on the filter. Image ana]ys~s =s a two-step procedure. In the first step the rectangular 
grid is found (grid finding) and adjusted using s~mulated annealing, and m the second step (quanUficat~on) 
the intensity of each spot is calculated by fitting Gauss~an spot shapes. The ~mage analysis ~s able 
to process a typical filter ~mage m less than 5 minutes which means that a representative cDNA-library 
(~ 800 ~mages) can be processed w~thin 3 days using a single processor umt. The spotting of duplicates 
allows several quahty checks. Correlation of duplicate signals is calculated either within the whole 
filter or w~thm parts of the filter (block correlatmn, field correlation). Images w~th a poor global 
correlatmn (below 0.6) are discarded Clone signals that are poorly reproduced are d~scarded only for 
that spec=fic hybrid~zatson. 2.3. Clustering The task of the clustenng procedure ~s to classify the 
clone- fingerprmts m order to group s=milar fingerprints together and to separate d~ss~milar ones. The 
calculated partmon reflects the number of different genes active m the t~ssue (number of clusters) and 
their relative frequencies (s~ze of clusters). (')el*m*% 1881;3 " clt~e L~9117 " [~t~l]~llt~!||t)l!l!i|H|)ltltlt[l|ti[IIli~)!tll)[Iti-q

data are somewhat error-prone. There are several existing normahzatlon strategies that can be used and 
that are adjusted to different biological questions, e.g ohgo-fingerprinting and complex-cDNA hybridizations. 
Clustering is based on a sequential k-means algorithm [17] improved and modified inhouse [l 8]. This 
procedure sequenually assigns each data-point to its nearest cluster center among the set of currently 
available cluster centers. Unlike commonly used k- means algorithms this procedure is enriched by heuristics 
that allow changes in the number of cluster centers by merging of centers and introducing new centers 
(unsupervised clustering). The algorithm is very fast because it allows parallel processing of data-points 
on multiple processors and re-clustering of the calculated initial partitions. Using this procedure it 
has been possible to cluster e.g 76,032 clones with very good results within 20 hours using 4 processor 
units in parallel. A quality check of the clustering results is done by hybridization of long-probes 
to the filter, i.e. cDNA-clones that have been identified and sequenced. Clones on the filter that are 
copies from the same gene hybridize to the specific long-probe. A set of different long-probes (15-30) 
is used to tune algorithmic parameters, check clustering quality and choose the optimal clustering. Figure 
2 shows a calculated cluster of 20 clones. 19 of the clones hybridized to a long-probe coming from the 
heat shock cogD90 protein gene, only I clone (marked with (*)) has been assigned falsely to this cluster 
The cluster has been calculated from a total of 76,032 clones hybridized with 200 probes. It is observable 
that a small proportion of probes (approximately 20) are common for all clones in the calculated cluster 
but that each clone shows additional signals with other probes due to e.g false positive error. However 
as this error is spread randomly among the set of probes, clustering is not affected seriously so that 
the procedure shows a good robustness to this kind of experimental error. 2.4. Database search based 
on experimental fingerprints An interesting question is if experimental fingerprints can be used to identify 
their clone with regard to sequences in public databases (e.g. Unigene). For that reason a binary fingerprint 
is assigned to each database sequence, i.e. a ! if the corresponding probe or its reverse complementary 
sequence matches with the sequence and a 0 if not For each cluster an experimental consensus-fingerprint 
is calculated (e.g the mean of all cluster members) and a p-value is calculated describing the significance 
of the similarity of each pair of consensus/database fingerprints using a combinatorical argument. This 
program gives e g. for the above calculated cluster an output of the following format: /*** cluster 296 
size 20 1.) p-value=l 360e-13, 21 probe hits, /gene= Human 90-kDa heat-shock protein gene, cDNA, complete 
cds, 2.) p-value=2.760e-12, 20 probe hits, /gene= Human 90-kDa heat-shock protein gene, cDNA, complete 
cds, Only the most significant matches are stored. In this case the consensus-fingerprint has been compared 
with the Unigene database and three sirmlar entries of varying sequence-lengths have been correctly found 
what reflects the redundancy within this database. 2.5. Sequence Analysis Following the clustering step 
(2.3) representative clones -typically from small clusters -are selected for sequencing, since these 
should correspond to moderately or rarely expressed genes. EST sequences are mainly produced lnhouse 
as 5' reads using standard ABI 377 and 3700 sequencers. An exception is the Zebrafish EST project, where 
most of the sequencmg part is performed at Washington University, St.Louis [19], and clones are sequenced 
from both sides routinely 2.5.1 Cleaning of raw sequence data The raw trace data have to pass several 
filtering steps before they can be used for intense data base comparisons. All the relevant operations 
are handled by a single script, which as input takes a set of ABI trace files, and on output generates 
a cleaned sequence set, which is forwarded then to the next step in the analysis pipeline (2.5.2). We 
will describe the detmls briefly in tabular form' ABI traces are transformed to SCF format and quality 
vah:es calculated by PHRED [20,21] PHRED quality values are read by a program and sequence bases with 
quality values less than a threshold value set by the user (default 10) are masked automatically.  A 
small vector data base is parsed by BLAST [22] and sequence regions with significant matches are masked. 
 repeats including simple repeats and low complexity regions are detected by RepeatMasker [23], and 
the respective regions are masked.  In each masking step the respective bases in the sequence file are 
replaced by N's, i.e. they won't be used in subsequent BLAST searches. All the results of the single 
cleaning steps are stored, sequences of very low quality, which did not pass the filtering procedure 
are tabulated for potential re-sequencing. 2.5.2 Data base mining and handling of results The next step 
in the analysis pipeline is computationally the most Intense part: All data, which survived the cleaning 
procedure have to be compared against a collection of common and internal data bases stored locally including 
Genbank [24], Swlssprot+Trembl [25], Unlgene[2], dbEST [1], GeneCards [26], and a lab-internal EST data 
base containing our own sequence data as well as some data from collaborators. Data base comparisons 
are performed in batch using the WU-BLAST package [27,28], where except for Genbank and dbEST the Organ~m

names, protein families, organisms or tissues, accession nrs. etc. They are also used in the final sequence 
clustering steps (3.3). Of special importance are the highly curated and annotated data bases like SwissProt 
or GeneCards, since a wealth of information can be gained for clones, which show significant homologies. 
In case of GeneCards, which currently (Sept 99) contains information about more than 8500 human genes, 
among those are approx 1300 known disease-related genes, the user is provided with detmled reformation 
about chromosomal location, product, similar genes, umgene cluste< medical applications or disorder, 
etc. However, GeneCards is an lnformanon retrieval system and provides no sequence data. We therefore 
downloaded all the relevant gene sequences from common data bases and compiled them into an internal 
GeneCards blast data base. 3. Results 3.2. Clustering efficiency and novel genes The easiest way for 
testing the efficiency of our clone selecnon based on OFPs is clustering of the EST sequences and measuring 
the redundancy of the EST sets. After testing various algorithms we finally used the PHRAP program [29], 
which was developed originally for assembly of shotgun data. PHRAP runs on most UNIX platforms, and zs 
able to assemble large batches of data in a few minutes on a standard workstation Using CONSED [30], 
a graphical tool for viewing and editing PHRAP's,assemblies, the sequence alignments can be checked and 
corrected, if necessary. From the PHRAP assembly results we deduce a global OFP clustenng efficiency 
of 53-69%, i.e. the number of detected singletons compared to all ESTs ( each EST represents one representative 
clone of a specific OFP cluster ). Table 2 shows the results for each EST project together with examples 
from the literature. Theoretically one could expect a percentage of singletons near to 100%, since each 
OFP cluster is represented by a single EST 3.3 Sequence clustering across organisms sequence. In practice 
the filter images building the basis of the OFP cluster analysis always contain noise, which reduces

the final result is excellent compared to EST projects, which rely on normahsation/subtraction methods 
Another important aspect is the development of an EST project through the course of time. With our method 
we obtain an almost linear increase of the number of clusters throughout the running sequence production, 
which is demonstrated in Figure 3 for the ZF data. Comparison to external projects shows again, that

scanned on the protein level against a data base containing all internal EST data, and the relevant information 
for all ESTs in the set ( clone name, blast E-value, matched clone in data base ) is stored in a flat 
table file. Based on that input data we developed a greedy algorithm, which clusters the ESTs iteratlvely:

at a specific cutoff E-value. Amphioxus Sea Urchin 28 3 21.5 71.7 79.5 In order to guess the number of 
unknown genes In our EST sets we partitioned the data into groups having stringent/no stnngent matches 
to common data bases. The result ( Table 3 ) shows that the number of novel genes should be very high, 
which also underlines the effectiveness of the OFP method, since the respective clones were selected 
from small OFP clusters, which should correspond to rarely expressed genes For our total set of ESTs, 
which also contains human and mouse ESTs from various internal projects or from collaborators, we calculated 
the following statistics: 47% fall into singletons, among the clustered ESTs 51% belong to clusters of 
size < 7 and 36% to clusters of size < 4. The cross-cluster information is extremely valuable, since 
parallel experiments (whole mount in situ, knockouts,etc.) on clones from other species can be performed, 
which might be too difficult or prohibitive e.g. for human or mouse clones (see 3.4).  than 30% for 
p>l.0e-7 ( i.e. the clone was predicted to have no homolog in the data base, and the respective EST indeed 
had no significant sequence match ). It seems that we have a method at hand, which provides a directed 
way either to find novel genes out of a large cDNA library or to identify clones homologous to known 
gene sequences with a remarkable success rate. These studies are being continued and wdl be described 
in detail in a forthcoming paper. 4.2 Gene expression analysis The screening of cDNA-libranes using the 
OFP approach offers the choice of agglomerating a vast amount of different genes that are acnve in a 
specific tissue under analysis on non- or low- redundant high density filters. These filters can be the 
basis for tissue-specific gene expression analysis studies (e.g. disease specific filters, development 
specific filters). Using these filter instead of general gene-cinps increases the chance of analyzing 
relevant genes for a spectfic disease or developmental stage and thus of extracting meaningful quahtauve 
knowledge. Several approaches m our lab are pointing in that direction. 5. Summary The OFP approach has 
proven to be an excellent strategy in large scale EST projects, since the redundancy of the resulting 
data is very low compared to other standard techniques. Moreover the OFP of a clone library can be used 
at any stage of a project to retrieve complementary information e.g. about slmdar clones in the same 
library or even different libraries, about potential sequence homologs m pubhc data bases or even about 
novel genes m the sample clone set without additional experimental work, since most of the desired reformation 
can be ginned from specially tmlored computer algorithms The data-analysts pipeline from image-analysis 
and clustenng to sequence analysis of EST data outlined m this article is essential for our ongoing projects, 
and nicely demonstrates the important role of Biomformatics m large EST projects. Interesting genes found 
by sequence analysis m our model orgamsms can be investigated by in vivo techniques, which cannot be 
employed for humans, and which provide a detmled view On the gene expression. Moreover, genes with completely 
unknown function could be assigned by in situ studies in model organisms hke the Zebrafish. References
