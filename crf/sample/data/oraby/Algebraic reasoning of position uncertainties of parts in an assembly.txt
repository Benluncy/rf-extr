part position uncertainties in an assembly caused by part shape errors. Shape errors are treated as small 
expansion displacement and inclination of nominal form features! Possible contacts between assembled 
partx are synthesized based on the analysis of motion of the parts. Aeeordingly, a system of linear equations 
dating shape errors and displace­ ments of parts from their nominal positions is obtained. They are algebraically 
solvti and part position uncertainties zaederived. 1. INTRODUCTION Machine parts have shape errors due 
to production. A shape error affects positions of other parts in an assembly and con­sequently influences 
the machine function. A designer must control such part position uncertainties by assigning ranges of 
allowable deviations of shape errors as tolerances. In order to properly specify tolerances, he/she must 
understand the effeet of shape errors on assembled part positions. 1.1 Related Works Many lines of researeh 
on the shape error analysis have been explored in the field of geometric modeling. Algebraic ap­proaches 
are recently proposed which allow to treat the shape error effect in a symbolic manner. Such treatment 
is expected to give designers valuable suggestions to achieve proper tolerancing. Hillyard and Braid 
have dealt with the shape error by introducing imaginary sliders between geometric elements of a solid 
model [1]. Requicha proposed to treat tolerances as spatial zones determined by offsetting the object 
s nomi­nal boundary [2]. Based on this framework, Fleming formul­ated shape errors and part position 
uncertainties as inequali­ties [3]. His method does not consider contact states be­tween parts and tends 
to overestimate the shape error effect. Permission to copy without fee atl or part of this material is

proposed a tolerancing framework based on the virtual boundary requirement (VBR) [4,5]. Based on VBRS, 
they derive algebraic conditions to be satis­fied in some speeific assemblies. 1.2 Basic Approach and 
Paper Overview In this paper, we propose an algebraic method to solve part position uncertainties caused 
by shape errors. Since derived solutions explicitly show the shape error effect on the part positions, 
further shape error analysis on machine functions is possible. Part shape errors ean be considered as 
small deforma­tion of form features. According to [3,4,5], we treat such shape errors by imaginary features 
which are similar to the nominal features and are positioned to tit the real features as closely as possible. 
Fig. 1 shows this approximation with 2 dimensional figures. The effect of two real features RF] and RF2 
in contact on the position of part P2 in regard to P] (a) is approximated by a contact of two imaginary 
fea­tures IF] andIFz, which are fitting the real features (b). Such imaginary features are treated as 
small expansion, displacement and inclination of the features with nominal geometry (NF1 and NF2 in Fig. 
l(b)). Therefore, real geom­etry of a flat face feature is approximated by small displace­ment and inclimtion 
of the nominal flat face. Real geome­try of a pin is approximated by small displacements and in­clination 
of a pin having a slightly different radius. Based on this approximation eoneep~ our shape error analysis 
proceeds in the following steps. (l)Solid models of parts with form feature description, ex­pected contacts 
between nominal features to realize an as­sembly, and shape error description according to the ga metric 
tolerance are initially given. Solid models are re­garded as nominal description of the part geomeIry. 
(2)Based on the nominal features and expected contacts, nominal positions of the parts in the assembly 
are de­rived by RAPT [6]. Basic mathematics of RAPT is given in section 2. (3)When parts have shape errors, 
contact states between real features become different from the ones expected on the nominal features. 
In section 3, we give classifications of possible contacts between features with shape errors. (4)Part 
sha~ errors are represented by linear equations and inequalities based on the nominal features. This 
algebraic interpretation is explained in section 4. (5)For each contact state classified in (3), algebraic 
con­straints representing the state are derived as linear equa­tions and inequalities. Section 5 explains 
this derivation. (6)Each part has several contacts with other parts. Possible combinations of contacts 
between assembled parts are synthesized based on the analysis of part motion. This method is discussed 
in section 6. (7)According to (4), (5) and (6), a system of equations relat­ing shape errors and displacements 
of parts from their nominal positions is obtained. The algebraic method for solving this system is briefly 
explained in section 7. Section 8 gives an example and section 9 is our conclusions and future work. 
2. RAPT [6] RAPT algebraically infers positions of parts when several contacts between form features 
of the parts are given. 2.1 Basic Mathematics When a coordinate frame is assigned to a part, its position 
in the world is determined by giving a transformation which transforms the axes of the world frame into 
the axes of the part frame in the world.  Any transformation can be composed by several rota­tions and 
translations, If we describe a vector V in 3-space by a homogeneous row vector v =(x y z 1) where x, 
y and z are the components of V. then the product v * rof(X, @ where 10 00 COSf3 sint?O 1 ro((X,O) = 
0 -sin@ cost10 00 01 (1) gives a rotation of V about the X axis by f?. In the same sense, r10001 0100 
trans(a,b,c) = 0010 1] Ubcl (2) gives a translation by a vector (a b c). A matrix M is also defined to 
represent a rotation about the Y axis to turn the X axis to its negative direction. A coordimte frame 
can be represented by three axes OX, OY and OZ. We can form a matrix W representing a set of standard 
axes as follows: r10001 LO OOIJ (3) When a transformation p is given, W * p represents a set of axes 
transformed by p. The small change of position from ( to t+ dt can be expressed in terms of a small translation 
by (~ 4 4) and small rotations c%, &#38; and &#38; about the X, Y and Z axes of tas follows [7]: r+df=t*(Z+ 
At) (4) At is called differential motion matrix and is defined as: o &#38; -($o -( 506.0 At = 6,-8. 00 
d.dy~O II (5) We refer to this matrix by A [dt,d,&#38;&#38;, &#38;, &#38;] in the follow­ing discussion. 
2.2 Form Features We recognize a part as a set of form features. In this paper, we consider flat faces, 
cylindrical pins and holes as form features. Each form feature has its boundary composed by edges and 
vertices of the solid model. We assume that the mouth of a hole or the tip of a pin has a complete circle 
rim. A form feature has its own coordinate frame. Therefore, position of a feature F in a part is defined 
as a transformation ~ which transforms the axes of the part into the axes of F in the coordinate frame 
of the part. A function owner(F) returns the part owning F. We also define a function p-pos(f ) which 
returns the position of part P in the world. Another function &#38;po,s(F) gives the position of F in 
the frame of owner@). Therefore, positions of the axes of F in the world can be expressed as W * ff­pos(F) 
* p-~os (owner(F)). We assign the axes of a featureF as follows: (l)Flat face: Axes are given as its 
origin is lying on F, and its X axis is normal to F and is pointing out from it. (2)Pin: Its origin is 
at the tip of F and the X axis is point­ing outward along the axis of F. (3)Hole Its origin is at the 
mouth of F and the X axis is pointing outward along the axis of F. 2.3 Algebraic Interpretation of Spatial 
Relations Two types of contact named against andjlts are considered in this papec (l)Two flat faces are 
considered against if they are coplanar and their normals are in opposition. (2)Pin and hole are in fits 
if their X axes lie on the same line but in opposite direction, If a feature FI of a part PI is related 
to a feature F2 of another part P2, the position of P2 can k described in terms of PI. Let pi = p-pos(Pi) 
tindfi =fl-p~s(Fi). (l)If F~ is against F2, we cart derive the position of the axes ofF2intheframe ofF] 
asW *f2 * p2 *prl *frl. The algebraic relation between the axes of FI and transformed axes of F2 is: 
w *f2 * p2 * p]-1 *f,-1 = w * M * KX(X, 9 * tms(o,Y,z) (6) where y, z and 8 represent the displacement 
and rotation of the axes of F2 with respect to the FI axes (Fig. 2). M * rot(X, 9) * tra?do,y.z) I h\ 
 1 Fig. 2 Flat face F1 against flat face F2. (2)If FI fits F2, the following equation is derived in 
the same mannen w *f2 *p2*pi-l *fd = W * M * rot(X, 9 * trans(x,(),o) (7) Accordingly, a set of equations 
concerning the posi­tions of the parts is derived. If some parts are fixed in the world, RAPT algebraically 
solves the equations and deter­mines the positions of other parts. 3. CLASSIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CONTACTS 
When parts have shape errors, contact state between two features is different from the one expected with 
their nomi­nal geometry. In this section, we give classifications of possible contacts based on our approximation 
concept. 3.1 Internal Feature and Extended Feature We first give a definition of internal features and 
extended features. Suppose two features FJ and F2 in contact, the in­ternal feature is calculated as 
a regional intersection of the nominal features corresponding to FI and F2. On the other hand, the extended 
feature is an infinite surface on which the nominal features of F1 andFz are both lying (see Fig. 3). 
Any point on the boundary of the internal feature can be classified according to its onginaf feature, 
which is either FI, F2 or both FI and F2. When vertices VS are given, a function origin(vs) returns FI 
if all the Vs are originally from either FJ or both Fl andFz, otherwise it returns F2. Suppose IF12 is 
an internal feature of two flat faces in against condition. If IF12 has a concave in its boundary, edges 
composing the concave are replaced by a new line edge to fill the concave. This process is applied repeatedly 
until the kmndary includes only convexities. If a curved edge with substantial length is found, new vertices 
are in­serted to divide it into several short edges. If lF12 is an internal feature of pin and hole in 
fits con­dition, ZF12 must be a cylinder with two end circle rims. Several new vertices are inserted 
into each rim edge as they become vertices of a perfect 2n-gon internally touching the rim (see Fig. 
3(b)). We usually use a perfect square, howev­er, hexagon or octagon are used instead if more precision 
is required. Such polygons on two rims are aligned as we can connect vertices of two polygons by lines 
which are parallel to the axis of IF12. new in tices Hole ~~ ,, ,: ,, 6 R !Y axis of the n internal

Contacts We approximate the contact state between two real features by contacts of some vertices of their 
internal feature and their extended feature. We name such vertices corresponding to the contact contact 
vertices (CVS). Fig. 4 shows an ex­ample of this approximation. Real features are approximated by imaginary 
features which are similar to their nominal shape, therefore, instead of against, three contact states 
named against], againm and against3 are recognized as possible contacts. Againstl is a single vertex 
contact. Aguinsr2 is a two vertices contact. Such Yertices are adjoining on the boundary of the internal 
feature and composing a confact line (CL). Against3 is a three or more vertices contact or plane contact 
and is the same as the original against. In the same manner, three contact states named fitsl, /f-contacI

instead of fits. Fitsl is a single vertex contact. Fits2 is a two vertices cott­tact. These two vertices 
must not align to the axis of the internal feature. Fitsj is another two vertices or line contact. Such 
line is also called CL and is parallel to the axis of the internal feature. Fig. 5 shows the above classification 
graphically. CL are such CV(S) and CL, CF is positioned according to the contact type as follows (l)Against~:

to interpret contact states algebraically, we int.m duce some new coordinate frames. We assign a coordinate 
frame to each vertex of the im temal feature IF12. Suppose V is such vertex, its coordinate frame named 
ver[exframe (W?) is defined as follows: (l)If IF12 is a flat face, VF is given as its origin is on V, 
and its axes are oriented in the same direction as the axes of origin((V]). (2)If lFn is a cylinder, 
VF is given as its origin is on V and its X axis is in the same direction as the X axis of F = origin({ 
V ) ). Its Y axis is orthogonal to F and pointing outside if F is a pin and pointing inside if F is a 
hole. In addition, we define a coordinate frame named con­tactfrume (CT) to CV(S) or CL of the contact. 
If CV(S) and Shape errors are given according to the geometric tolerance definition. Two major types 
of errors are considered in Japanese Industrial Standards [8], which are form errors and positional errors. 
In geometric tolerancing, the form or po­sitional error is controlled by the zones within which this 
feature is to be contained. In defining the errors of form or position, it is assumed that the considered 
feature has no other deviations than those to which the definition refers. Positional errors are measured 
by using other features named dawn as basis. It is assumed that the geometry of the datum feature is 
sufficiently accurate for its purpose. 4.2 Treatment of Positional Errors Algebraic interpretation of 
positional errors is explained first. This type of error is treated as a small displacement and inclination 
of the nominal feature with reference to the datum. To position a feature, at most three datum features 
are given. These features are ordered and compose a datum sys ­tern. Spatial relationships between the 
datum features must be the same as those between the features established on the nominal solid. When 
a part and its datum system are given, the part is positioned with the first datum is located as closely 
as possible to its associated feature. Then the part is further positioned with the second and third 
datum features touching their associated features in the same manner. To interpret the above constraint, 
we introduce an imaginary object composed by datum features. A part with shape errors is positioned against 
this datum object to real­ize proper contacts with datum features as discussed. This positioning is achieved 
by the method to be explained in section 5 and 6. When the part is properly fixed, position of a feature 
FPE with a positional error is determined by its correspond­ing feature FNPE with no such deviations 
and the datum F D. Let pPE = p-pos(owner(FPE)}, $PE =fl-pos(FPE], fNpE = ff­PDS(FNPE),pD = p-pos(DwncY(FD)) 
and fD =fl-pos(FD). pPE, pD andfD zm determined when the part is positioned against the datum object. 
fNPE is calculated with reference to the datum. According to the RAPT definition, we can derive the fol­ 
 lowing algebraic constraint betweenfNPE, pPE, pD andfD. W *fNPE*PPE*f?D-l*fD-l =W*lD (8) where tD is 
a transformation which transforms the axes of FD into the axes of FNPE with respect to the coordinate 
frame of FD. Since FNPE has no positional errors, we can calculate tD by using the solid model description. 
Accordingly, we can detertrtinefww. We then determine the positions of the axes of FPE based on the axes 
of FNPE. Since FP.E and FNPE are in the same part, the following constraint equation can be derived W 
*fPE *fNPE-l = W * tP (9) where tpis a transformatiort which transforms the axes of FNPE into the axes 
of FPE with respect to the frame of FNPE. rP is determined according to the positional error type and 
FD. Here we give an example of tP. Example: tP for position errors of the axis of a pin (see Fig. 6). 
When FNPE is properly positioned by referring to the datum, tpfor position errors concerning YE and ZE 
di­rections of the datum ix tP = rot(X,9 * (Z + A [0,uj,4,0,0,0]) * ro@,-@ (10) where rot(X, 9 rotates 
the axes of FNPE to orient its Y and Z axes in parallel to YE and ZE directions. Small dis­placements 
by uj and d place its origin on the origin of FPE. Finally, r&#38;(X,-@ orients its axes to the axes 
of FPE. If position tolerances Ty and TZ are given in YE and ZE directions, the following inequalities 
must be satisfied. (11)(141 ~Ty/2)A(141sT,/2) 4.3 Treetment of Form Errors The effect of form errors 
in an assembly is also approximat­ed by imaginary features which are similar to the nominal features, 
but their sizes and positions are a bit different. Suppose to position an imaginary feature FFE for 
inter­preting a form error based on the feature FNFE with no form errors. Let f%E =fl-pos(F~E) and fN~E 
=f-pos(FNFE). fNFE k already determined as explained in 4.2. FFE and FNFE are in the same part, therefore, 
the following relation is derived: W * fFE* fNFE 1= W * tF (12) where m is a transformation which transforms 
the axes of FNFE into the axes of FFE with respect to the frame of FNFE. To evaluate rhe form error effat 
through contact, we consider the CF given in 3.3. Now we can represent t~as tF = tFE1 * tNFE. (13) where 
tFE and tNFE express the position of the axes of the CF with respect to the frames of FFE and FNFE. We 
approx: mate tfmand tNFE by using the form feature with nominal geometry. Therefore, both tFEand tNFE 
ate approximated by tmr which is calculated based on the solid model. When above approximation is applied, 
(13) is changed to tF=tNFE -l * (Z + AI+ * tNFE (14) where AF is a differential motion matrix with respect 
to the CF. AF is determined according to the contact type as fol­lows. If a form tolerance TF is imposed 
on the real feature, we can define additional inequalities to be satisfied. (l)Agaim~: AF = A [dt,O,O,O,O,O]

then the X coordinate Vi. of Vi in the CF is calculated as follows (see also Fig. 9): Vix=Viz&#38;-Viy

INTERPRETATION OF CONTACTS In this section, algebraic constraints to interpret contact conditions are 
given. 5.1 Equation Constraints In the following explanation, we refer to two features con­cerning a 
certain contact by FI and FE. FI k the feature given by origin(CVs) where CVS are CVS of the internal 
feature. The other feature is referred to as FE. Let fi = ff ­pos(FJ), fE = ff-pos(FE), pI = p-pos(owner(Ft)) 
and pE = p ­pos(owner(FE)). fr and fE are defined in consideration of shape errors as explained in section 
4 and may include some differential motion variables representing shape errors. Accordingly, the following 
algebraic constraint can be de rived W *fE*PE*PI_~ *fI-~ =W *tc (22) where tcexpresses the positions 
of the axes of FE in the co­ordinate frame of FI. If we consider the CF, we can represent tcby the fol­lowing 
transformation: tC=tE l * tl (23) where tI and L?express the position of the axes of the CF with respect 
to the coordinate frames of FI and FE. We approximate tland t,?by using the form features with nominal 
geometry. t] is approximated by tfwhich is a transformation expressing the position of the CF with re­spect 
to the frame of the nominal feature of FI. tE is also approximated by tE which is derived based on the 
nominal feature of FE. When these approximations are applied, (23) is changed to cc = t~ -l* (Z+ Ac) 
* U (24) where Ac is a differential motion matrix at the CF. The position of a part with influences 
of shape errors can be expressed as small displacements and rotations from its nominal position. Therefore, 
we can apply differential approximations to replace pr andpE with p =pI * (Z + AI) (25) p,z =pE * (Z 
+ AE) (26) where pI and pE represent the nominal positions of the parts. AI and AE are differential motion 
matrices for pt and pE . Consequently, the following equation is derived based on (22) -(26): tE *fE 
* pE * AE -tI *fI*pI *AI =Ac*tl *f[*pl (27) Ac is defined according to the contact type: (l)Agairm: Ac

CVS, Suppose CFJ and CF2 represent CFS at two CVS. Let tll ,and ACI are transformations for CFI lEl and 
tn , tm and Ac2 are for CF2. If the direction of the X axis of CF2 in the world is in the negative direction 
of the X axis of CFI, m and tm are changed to M * tn and M * tE2 . ACI = A[&#38;,O,&#38;, &#38;I, C5yl,6ZI] 
and Ac2 = A [&#38;,0,42,&#38;,&#38;2,&#38;2] where dil = h, &#38; = &#38;, 61 = &#38;2, and &#38; = -&#38;. 
If the angle between the Y axes of CFJ and CF2 is q, the following constraints are addition­ally given 
(see also Fig. 13): e= ~,d=21r-r lc0s6 (28) where lx is signed distance from the origin of CF2 to the 
origin of CFI along the X axis of CF1. (6)Fim: Ac = A[&#38;O,d,&#38;,O,O] (see Fig. 14). 5.2 Inequality 
Constraints When CVS are touching the extended feature, other vertices of the internal feature must be 
locate above the extended fea­ture to avoid the interference (see Fig. 3). This condition is interpreted 
as inequalities. Suppose a vertex V of the internal feature and FI = origin({V )). FE is determined in 
the same manner for the equation constraints. If we consider the VF of V as defined in 3.3, we can represent 
tc of (23) by tC = tVE-l * tVI (29) where tw and tvE express the position of the axes of the VF with 
respect to the frames of FI and FE. We approximate tvI and tvE by using the form features with nominal 
geometry and use tvl and WE instead. Now (29) can be approximated by tc = tVE -l * (Z + Av) * tVI (30) 
 where Av is a differential motion matrix at the VF. &#38; ,! !, ACI = A[dxI,O,dzl,&#38;I, &#38;,&#38;I]

several contacts with other parts in an assembly. In this section, we give a method to synthesize all 
possible combinations of such contacts based on the amlysis of the part motion. 6.1 Assumptions for Contact 
Synthesis The following three constraints are assumed for synthesiz­ing the contact combination. (l)A 
part is assumed to be positioned in stable condition. We define a predicate + as re13 e reb meaning retz 
is a stabler contact than reh. Thus, aguinsfl d ugainsn e agahsts and fits] G fits2 G fitsJ. When two 
sets Si and Sj of contacts are given, we can ignore Si if any contact in Si is smaller or equal in G 
to its corresponding con­ tact in Sj. (2)A contact is assumed to be realized in a step by step manner. 
For example, before realizing three vertices con­tact (againm) between Ff and F 2, two vertices contact 
(agtukm) must be realized, and before realizing two ver­tex contact, single vertex contact (againstl) 
must be real­ized between the same feature pair. In the same way, be fore realizingjitw or fits2, fitsl 
must be realized. (3)The displacement or rotation of a part from its nominal position to achieve a certain 
contact should be small enough. This assumption restricts the geometry of a fea­ture to make a contact 
when a certain relative motion is possible. For example, if a flat face FI is permitted to ro­tate about 
Ax, itcan realize againm contact with an edge E] by a small rotation (see Fig, 15(a)), however, it must 
rotate nearly 90 degrees to realize a contact with E2 (b). (a) @) Fig. 15 Motion wnstraint to realize 
agatitj contact. 6.2 Primary Contact When a force is applied somewhem on a part, according to where it 
is applied and its direction, some specific contacts are more easily realized than others. It is a difficult 
problem to determine proper contacts automatically by evaluating the effect of the force. Instead, we 
permit the user to specify some contacts cakxl primary contacts explicitly on account of the force effect. 
The sys­tem determines other unspecified contacts automatically tak­ing the primary contacts into consideration. 
6.3 Analysis of Part Motion Our contact combination synthesis is based on the analysis of relative motion 
of parts in an assembly. When the initial position of part P is given asp, the smatl change of the part 
position top + @ can be expressai asp * (1 + AP) by using the differential motion matrix AP. Thus AP 
can be considered to represent the part motion. When an assembly composed by n parts Pi (1 S i S n) is 
given, we assign a differential molion matrix A [&#38;i,c$i,dZi,&#38;i, &#38;i,&#38;i] toeach Pi. If 
there is a pm in the as­sembly whose position is fixed in the world, we give null matrix O instead for 
its differential motion. These parts may have several contacts each other. For each contac~ we can determine 
FI and FE by using the CVS realizing the contact as explained in 5.1. Based on the equa­ tion (27), we 
can derive a linear algebraic constraint be­tween differential motion matrices of parts mwte@O &#38;l 
OWW(FE). We can ignore small shape errors for calculating the part motion. Therefore, we use the following 
equation instead of (27): tE *fE *PE *AE-tl *fi *pI *AI = AC * tI *fI * JX {32) where fI and fE represent 
nominal positions of form fea­tures FI and FE in their owner part s frame. Other variables are the same 
as the equation (27). All the transformations except A], AE and Ac are calculated by using the nominal 
geometry of the parts. Accordingly, a system of linear equations relating dif­ferential motion matrices 
of all parts in the assembly is constructed. We can eliminate some variables of A1, AE and A c by applying 
algebraic variable elimination method (for example, Buchberger algorithm [9]) on the system. If we eiiminate 
such variables as much as possible, we can repre­sent differential motion matrices AP of part P by some 
lim­ited number of motion variables, which represents the pos­sible motion of P in the assembly. 6.4 
Motion Constraint for Realizing a Contact We approximate the real contact as the contacts of some vertices 
of the internal feature and its corresponding extend­ed feature. Here we consider a motion constraint 
to realize such vertex contacts. Suppose Vs are the vertices of the internal feature pro­posed to approximate 
a contact between FJ and F2. If F] = origin, we assign FI = FI and FE = F2, otherwise, FI = F2 and FE 
= FI, According to the assumption (2) in 6.1, we assume that a set of vertices CVS c Vs are now retilzing 
contacts with the extended feature. As explained in 6.3, by using currently available contacts, which 
include the con­tacts realized by CVS, we can compose a set of linear equa­tions relating differential 
motion matrices of the parts based on (32) and can derive the possible motion of owner(F~) and owner(F@ 
in the assembly. NOW we select a vertex v ~ (vs -CV~) and consider whether V can achieve an additional 
contact. If we consider the VF of V, we can derive the following constraint equa­tion based on (3 1). 
tVI? *fE * pE * AE * pi -l *fI -l * tvI -l -tv{ *fi * @ * Ar * PI -l * fI -l * tvi -~ = AV (33) where 
tvl , WE , pI and pE are the same as the equation (31).fi and fE are used instead offl andf!?, which 
represent nominal positions of FI and FE in their owner part s fkune. These transformations are all determined 
by using the solid model. AE and Al are differential motion matrices of OWW(FI) and owner(FE) and are 
already derived As the re­sult, a differential motion matrix Av is determined which represents the possible 
motion of V with respect to the VF. Based on the assumption (3) in 6.1, in order to realize a contact 
near P on the extended feature, V must have a rela­tive motion toward P (see Fig. 16). Therefore, if 
origirt({ V ) ) is a flat face, A v must have a relative motion along its X axis. If origirt([V}) is 
a pin or hole, Av must have a relative motion along its Y axis. Fig. 16 Motion constraint for acideving 
a contact at P. 6.5 Contact Combination Synthesis Algorithm Based on the motion constraint for realizing 
a contact, we developed an algorithm for c#culating atl possible contact combinations. In the foIlowing 
explanation, c-rel-list is a list of c-rel which is a structured data with expected contact type (either 
against or fits) and two nominal features concerning the contact. We can refer to the contact type by 
a function c­type(c-rel) and two features byfl~(c-ref) andjj2(c-ref). p-c-info-list and c-info-list are 
lists of c-inJo which is also a structured data with possible contact type (either againsnm or fits~/2/J) 
and various contact information (e.g. CV and CL of the contact) required for calculating the pos­sible 
motion of the parts. Contact Combination Synthesis Algorithm Outline input: c-rel-list of expected contact 
relations and p-c­info-list of primary contacts. Output: All possible contact combinations. Method (l)Prepare

contact combination, we can derive a set of linear equations based on (27) which relates shape errors 
and differ­ential motion matrices of the parts. If we assign null matrix O as the differential motion 
matrices of the parts fixed in the world, we can solve the equations by eliminating the variables representing 
the differential motion in AI, AE and Ac of (27). We developed variable elimination programs based on 
the Buchberger algorithm [9]. If such variables are successfully eliminated, differential motion matrices 
of the parts are represented only by shape error variables. Therefore, we can show the effect of the 
shape errors on the part positions by substituting differential motion matrices in (25) or (26) by the 
solution. 8. EXAMPLE We applied our shape error analysis method on an example problem to evaluate its 
applicability. Fig. 17 shows two parts named Plate and Base for ex­ample assembly. Shape error specifications 
are also shown in the figure, We consider only radius changes of pins and holes as possible form errors. 
We assume that Base is fixed in the world and a downward force is applied on PMe. Expected contacts between 
Plate and Base are (against Top Bottom), (fits HoleI Pin]) and @ts Holez Pinz). RAPT first determines 
the nominal positions of the parts. Then the system synthesizes possible contact combinations. To eval­uate 
the force effect on Plate, we explicitly assign against3 [ downward Frame for ~forcePlate ­P[atet Bottom

of the shape errors on the part position is explic­itly shown in the solution. A differential motion 
variable 6xI remains in the soltt­tion, because our approximation of contacts is correspond­ing to the 
state shown in Fig. 19. Therefore, manual reex­amination of the solution is needed. The system is now 
rtm­ning on a MacIvoryz lisp machine. It takes 1 CPU second for calculating the solution (34). jitsl

algebraic method is proposed to calculate part position uncertainties in an assembly. We are now planning 
to verify the method by comparing the analysis re­sult with measurements of the actual parts. Future 
work to­ward a CAD system for tolerancing is also planned: (l)Based on the analysis result, we can calculate 
a possible range of machine function deviation. Therefore, we can verify the tolerance specifications 
whether the calculated range is included in the acceptable range of the function deviation. (2)When the 
tolerance verification fails, we can apply the sensitivity analysis method of linear programming to ob­tain 
suggestions for improving the tolerance specifica­tions. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was supported
