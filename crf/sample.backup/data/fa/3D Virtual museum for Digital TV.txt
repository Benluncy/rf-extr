heritage are fundamental for individuals education and contribute in establishing the cultural identity 
of nations. However, despite its importance, a number of cultural heritage collections have been lost 
because the mechanisms of preservation did not follow the technology, causing irreparable losses due 
to var­ious factors such as the action of degrading agents, weather, inadequate handling and storage. 
Worldwide, invaluable pieces need to be cataloged, so that they can be exposed to the public, which often 
may come too late. The development of culture heritage preservation projects has led more researchers 
to explore strategies to make the preserved objects available in the digital world, for example, by creating 
virtual collections [1] and virtual tours of historic sights [2]. One of the main concerns focused on 
this subject is to develop robust techniques to preserve the original char­acteristics of a given asset 
as much as possible [3], [4]. Currently, the use of 3D scanning techniques is become increasingly important 
in research projects regarding cultural heritage [4], [5]. The 3D digitization can be used to preserve 
cultural heritage assets in their smallest details, in a safe way, allowing the construction of replicas 
even when the original no longer exists as well as the creation of virtual collections accessible through 
the Internet. Usually, the 3D digitization process begins with acquisition of views of the object by 
using a 3D scanner, under different angles while keeping overlapping regions between views. Once obtained, 
the views are aligned in a same 3D coordinate system andthenintegrated toproducea3Dmodel oftheobject 
(i.e. given by a 3D modeling from images process). After this integration procedure a texture can be 
applied over the 3D model to provide a more realistic visualization [6]. This paper presents a 3D visualization 
system designed for usein low-performanceandhardwarerestricted platformssuch as set-top-boxes for Digital 
TV. The system was developed at the IMAGO Research Group1 and used in a 3D virtual 1http://www.imago.ufpr.br

assets project, with the following goals: Development of a 3D reconstruction pipeline for digital preservation 
of objects from natural and cultural heritage collections;  Development of an interactive photo-realistic 
visualiza­tion system as an application for the Brazilian Digital TV System.  These goals are complementary 
and represented the .rst experiments in implementing applications for 3D visualization to spread knowledge 
and culture through the Digital TV in Brazil. The main purposes of this project are: 1) provide social 
inclusion through digital inclusion; 2) develop applications with a high degree of interactivity, to 
be used for cultural her­itage education and dissemination; 3) explore support mecha­nisms to enable 
the use of Digital TV for disseminating such information. The rest of this paper is focused on presenting 
and discussing the developed 3D visualization system for the Brazilian Digital Digital TV System. II. 
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT A. Brazilian Digital TV System The digital standard of content provided by Digital 
TV enables a great exchange of information between the tele­vision system and the Internet, with a great 
potential for education [7], entertainment [8] and cultural applications [1], [2]. This trend tends to 
intensify with the evolution of mobile phones [9] [11] and recent developments in 3D TV [12], [13]. The 
Digital TV system combines several technologies to improve image quality, also enabling a signi.cant 
increase in the number of available channels [14]. The reception and decoding of the signal is performed 
by a highly compact system known as set-top-box. Aiming at portability, the Brazilian Digital TV System 
was developed based on the Java applications model [15]. The environment in which applications are executed 
is called middleware. It consists of several modules, including a compact Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
for the execution of applications [15]. In the case of Brazil, the middleware has been developed in a 
joint work of researches from Federal University of Paraiba and Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, 
called Ginga2. An application to run on Digital TV follows a pattern called Xlet, which is a simpli.cation 
of the applet model. Thus, a Xlet is a Java 2Additional information in http://www.gingancl.org.br (a)

in different ways by the user. Several brazilian research groups were gathered in a con­sortium with 
the aim of developing technologies for the deployment of Digital TV in the country. The objective was 
to develop the following: a) hardware technology; b) software infrastructure (middleware); and c) applications 
to run on the system. Also, it was considered the following scenarios for the Brazilian Digital TV applications: 
1) TV without return path (i.e. back channel to connect to the Internet); 2) TV with intermittent return 
path (i.e. dialup, cable, ADSL); 3) TV with permanent return path, such as a broadband IP connection. 
When available, the return path can be used to provide interactivity in applications, such as real-time 
live voting, for instance. The work presented in this paper was developed as an application of this consortium. 
Also, in order to allow social inclusion, it wasestablishedinthisworktheapplicationshould have a minimal 
cost to consumers, and therefore the .rst scenario was choosen as more appropriate for the proposed application. 
 B. 3D Virtual Museum One of the biggest challenges of this project was to develop a 3D application that 
could run in the restricted hardware for the Brazilian Digital TV System. Given the impossibility of 
3D real-time rendering on the set-top-box, the alternative for 3D visualization of objects from a 3D 
Virtual Museum was to simulate a 3D environment by using 2D images. By considering an imaginary sphere 
around the 3D model, where a set of images are taken from different view angles (as shown in Figure 1), 
it is possible to obtain a discretization of a 3D model. With this set of 2D images one can provide to 
the observer the sensation of a 3D visualization by displaying them in a particular order. This technique 
allows to show high quality images with low response time while preserving high level of interativity, 
which are ideal conditions for Digital TV applications. To obtain these images, it was built a renderer 
capable of producing photo-realistic images taken around the object at regular angular intervals, as 
shown in Figure 2. These generated images are visual representations of the 3D model, from different 
points of view, to be used in the visualization system. Also, they are arranged in a graph representation,

graph, in which the user can navigate and visualize the object as shown in Figure 3. The visualization 
of two adjacent images produces the feeling of rotating the object in the case of an external view (see 
Figure 5). In the case of an internal view, the graph contains images generated from an internal sphere 
to the object (see Figure 4(b)). The system has two modes of visualization: external:the object can be 
seen from outside (as in Figure 4(a)); and internal: the object can be seen from the inside out (as in 
Figure 4(b)). In Figure 4, the green sphere represents the referencesurface fortakingtheimagesof theobject(Figure1). 
The visualization graph contains all the necessary informa­tion to allow the visualization of an object. 
Strictly speaking, this graph represents a discretization of a real 3D visual­ization of the object, 
in with a step is a regular angular interval, which the value is de.ned by the content producer. Assuming 
that the user is in a given position, every time a Fig. 5. Visualization graph representation containing 
arranged images in order to simulate a 3D ambient. Fig. 6. Position links: allows the navigation between 
objects of the scene. movimentation action is activated in the system interface, the position on the 
graph is updated to display the corresponding image to the moviment direction, in accordance to the rules 
of external/internal visualizations modes (see Figure 5). Thus, when the users visualize the image sequences, 
they have a sensation of movement in a three-dimensional ambient. The visualization system was developed 
using very basic Java resources, to allow full consistency with several Digital TV patterns, including 
JavaTVD, and uses a con.guration .le to de.ne scenes, by including information of the correct image arrangement, 
possible moviment actions, among other interface parameters. The advantage of this method is that the 
content producer can freely create the scenes, the paths between objects, the visualization modes of 
each object, and so on by de.ning the characteristics of the scene in the con.guration .le, withoutthe 
need to re-compile thevisualiza­tion system. In this sense, it was de.ned several mechanisms for navigation 
and control, as the concept of position link, which allows access paths between the visualization graph 
of the objects and gives to the user the possibility to travel inside the virtual environment. The set 
of possible positions is composed by a combination of all possible paths between graphs of each object 
in the scene (see Figure 6). In the application prototype for the Brazilian Digital TV System, the user 
can make movements (i.e. 3D virtual museum navigation) by pressing left, right, up, down and OK buttons 
from the remote control. With this, one can make a huge range of possible paths between objects to provide 
more user interactivity and expe­riences. When the user choose a position of an object which (a) (b)

the users. has a link to another object, a button is enabled on the system interface. This button gives 
to the user the possibility to follow the link and to navigate through the virtual environment. To build 
the scene in the con.guration .le, it was developed a proper syntax, which is interpreted by the application. 
An important aspect for the visualization is the experience offered to the user s senses, not the process 
itself. In this case, although the process is a 3D simulation, the visualization is really three-dimensional, 
albeit with some restrictions (Fig­ure 7). A major problem that emerged during the development was the 
amount of memory occupied by the data. The traditional way to store images on Java-based applications 
consumes too much memory, what makes it impracticable for restricted plataforms, such as set-top-boxes 
for Digital TV, which has only 32 MB for the operating system and applications. In our experiments, by 
using 13 objects the average of occupancy is around 35 MB of memory where: 8 objects were composed by 
60 images each, 2 objects with only one images; and 3 objects composed by 24 images. The images are around 
5 KB in size. When loading images, the Java classes use a lot of memory, because the image .les are converted 
to an uncompressed image format in memory. So, it was necessary to work with compressed images in memory, 
in order to keep in memory approximately the same size as in the .le system. Then, the images are loaded 
to memory using a binary format (i.e. com­pressed jpeg), and unpacked only at the visualization moment. 
With this, we reduced the memory occupancy from initially 32 MB to acceptable 8 MB. The use of compressed 
formats for information has been useful not only for the application in the set-top-box environment, 
but also for transmission of information in the Digital TV signal. The Digital TV signal has a smaller 
range in the electro­magnetic spectrum, which means that, it .ts four or .ve sub­channels instead of 
only one as in analogic TV. Thus, several groupsofinformationcanbesentintheoldchannelspace.The data are 
sent in successive sets of packets periodically, base on a process called datacarousel [15]. Thesystemwasstructured 
to allow the user to start the applicaiton without having all the data loaded into memory. Loading models 
according user navigation was not implemented, due middleware limitations at development time. A line 
of execution (thread) is in charge of making the data loading via the signal antenna, and another line 
of execution is responsible for running the application itself. And thus, the application is displaying 
as fast as possible. The images that describe the 3D model from the actual position of the user images 
are loaded and the visualization graph is generated. Also, even with a image decompression in real time, 
the applicaiton response time is around tenths of a second. After the success of the visualization system 
in the Brazilian Digital TV System, a second version of the system was developed for the Internet. This 
new version is based on the same principles, but with an improved interface, which includes the possibility 
of interaction through the mouse. Both versions presented good performance with low consumption of memory 
and processing while preserving high level of interactivity. The internet version of the system is available 
at the IMAGO Research Group website3. The main disadvantages of the system is absense of some real-time 
characteristics, such zoom, viewing object from any angle and dif.cult viewing of dynamical systems. 
And some interesting characteristics are: Scalability: the only limitation to the number objects is 
the amount of available memory.  Flexibility: the content producer can easily create and change scenes 
without need to re-compile the system.  Economy: low memory requirement and saves resources for more 
important tasks.  Effectiveness: the system can display photo-realistic images from 3D models in a constant 
response time, independently of the complexity of the model being displayed.  Reusability: the system 
is organized into reusable mod­ules, which can be used by other more complex applica­tions.  Usability: 
the user needs only the arrows and OK buttons to use the system.  These characteristics make this system 
an ideal laboratory for testing and developing new applications for Digital TV. III. CONCLUSIONS The 
proposed system represents one of the .rst initiatives to develop 3D visualization applications in the 
Brazilian Digital TV System. The mistakes and successes during its develop­ment were worthwhile to de.ne 
limits between applications and the middleware, and to generate guidelines to be adopted in future projects. 
Obviously, these limits are changing every day since the Brazilian System of Digital TV is constantly 
evolving. For this project, the main contributions were: Develop an three-dimensional visualization 
application to be used in the Brazilian Digital TV System;  Propose a novel paradigm for 3D visualization 
in Digital TV;  Providewaysofsocialinclusionthroughdigitalinclusion, due to the choice of the most restrictive 
scenario for using the application (i.e. set-top-box without return path).  3http://www.inf.ufpr.br/imago/pt 
museu3d prototipo.html The use of the techniques of 3D scanning and reconstruc­tion, as well its visualization 
(from Internet or Digital TV) has proved to be a effective alternative as a way of preserving and disseminating 
culture. Besides the contribution of the project as a whole, the project provided an alternative way 
to create 3D visualization applications for restricted plataforms while preserving high interactivity, 
image quality and ef.ciency. With this, the proposed system can provide the basis for a number of other 
applications for Digital TV and Internet. The balance between processing and memory usage makes the system 
ideal for use in embedded systems, in which these two factors are critical, specially for Digital TV 
applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Federal University of Parana, for the
