 An NP-Complete Number-Theoretic Problem Eitan M. Gurari and Oscar H. Ibarra Department of Computer 
Science University of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Abstract Systems of nonlinear equations 
of the form D: Ay = ~(x), where A is an mxn matrix of rational constants and y = (Yl.....yn) , $(x) = 
(Ol(X) ..... Om(X)) are column vectors are considered. Each ai(x) is of the form ri(x ) or Lri(x)J, where 
ri(x ) is a rational function of x with rational coeffi- cients. It is shown that the problem of determin- 
ing for a given system D whether there exists a nonnegative integral solution (yl,...,Yn,X) satis- fying 
D is decidable. In fact, the problem is NP- complete when restricted to systems D in which the maximum 
degree of the polynomials defining the gi(x)'s is bounded by some fixed polynomial in the length of the 
representation of D. Some recent results connecting Diophantine equations and counter machines are briefly 
mentioned. i. Introduction Hilbert's tenth problem [7] is the problem of determining for a given polynomial 
P(Xl,...,Xn) (or a system of polynomials Pi(Xl,...,Xn), 1 i ! m) with integer coefficients whether it 
has a nonnegative integer solution, i.e., nonnegative integers el,...,~n such that p(el,...,~n) = 0 (pi(~l 
.....an) = 0 for 1 < i < m). Hilbert's tenth problem is undecidable for: (i) polynomials of degree 
4 [14,18],  (ii) polynomials in 13 unknowns [15] (it was reported in [13] that this has been reduced 
to 9 unknowns), and  (iii) systems of quadratic polynomials [3,9]. On the otherhand, Hilbert's tenth 
problem is decid- able for: (iv) polynomials in 1 unknown and  (v) polynomials of degree 2 [17].  
 It is not known whether the degree 4 in (1) and the 9 unknowns in (li) are minimal. Also, the minimal 
number of quadratic polynomials needed to prove the undecidability is (iii) is not known. A decision 
procedure for a large class of polynomi- als in 2 unknowns is known [3] but not yet for the general case. 
For 3 unknowns very little is known. Pinpointing the precise boundary between decidability and undecidability 
of Hilbert's tenth problem with respect to the degree, the number of unknowns, and number of quadratic 
polynomials in the system remains an interesting research problem. A related problem which is of practical 
interest is that of finding special classes of polynomials (or systems of polynomials) for which Hilbert's 
tenth problem is decidable. This paper studies one such class. Consider a system of nonlinear equations 
of the form D: Ay = ~(x), where A is an mxn matrix of rational constants and y = (Yl.... 'Yn )'~(x) 
= (~l(X) ..... ~m(X)) are column vectors. Each a.(X)l = r.(x)l or __Iri(x)|, where r.(x)l is a rational 
function of x with rational coefficients (i.e., r.(x) is a ratio of 2 polynomials in x). Thus, D i is 
an instance of the nonlinear integer program- ming problem [4]. (Note that by (iii) above, the general 
nonlinear integer programming problem is undecidable even when the equations contain only quadratic constraints.) 
Here, we show that the problem of determining for a given system D: Ay = ~(x) whether there exists a 
nonnegative integral solution (yl,...,Yn,X) satisfying D is decidable. In fact, the problem is NP-complete 
when re- stricted to systems D in which the maximum degree of the polynomials defining the ~i(x)'s is 
some fixed polynomial in the length of the encoding of D. The difficult part of the NP-completeness 
proof is showing that determining if a nonnegative inte- ger solution exists is decidable in nondetermin- 
istic polynomial time. In most of the NP-complete- ness proofs in the literature (see, e.g., [2,10, 16]) 
this part is trivial while the NP-hardness proof (i.e., the polynomial time reduction of anNP- complete 
problem to the problem under considera- tion) is the difficult part. The NP-completeness of some very 
simple number-theoretic problems has earlier been shown in [13]. For example, it is shown in [13] that 
the problem of determining if a Diophantine equation of the form ay = c -bx 2 (where a,b,c are nonnegative 
integers) has a non- negative integer solution in y and x is NP- complete. (Note that this equation is 
a very special case of the system D.) The result is interesting since this problem is one of the sim- 
plest number-theoretic problems which have been shown NP-complete. The problem is clearly decid- able 
in nondeterministic polynomial time since any solution (y,x) must satisfy y ~ I~] and x ~ [~]. The NP-hardness 
proof (the satisfiability problem was the one used in [13] in the reduction) is the difficult part of 
the NP-completeness proof. We should also mention that [3] contains a proof of the decidability of systems 
of equations of the form [ri(x) j = [ui(x)J, 1 < i < m, ri(x) and ui(x) are rational functions of x 
with rational coeffi- cients. Such systems are obviously special instances of the systems considered 
here. For systems of the form [ri(x,y) j = [ui(x,y) j (i.e., systems in two variables x,y), the problem 
is un- decidable [15]. Let E be a fixed binary encoding of systems of the form D: A T = $(x). Clearly, 
any such encoding has the property: IE(D) I = length of E(D) ~ max{m,n,log2a, log2b, log2d}, where a 
= a 1 max{abs(al),abs(a 2) I aU is a rational constant in A} (abs(x) = absolute value of x), b = max{abS(bl) 
, b 1 abs(b 2) I b~2 is a rational coefficient in ri(x), 1 < i < m}, and d = max{degrees of polynomials 
 defining ri(x), 1 < i < m}. We shall have the a 1 convention that.if a rational constant--is 0, a 2 
then a 2 is taken to be i. Similarly, if a rational function rj(x) = ~i(x )si(x) is 0, then si(x) = 
0 and zi(x) = i. Thus, a,b ~ i. Also, to avoid trivial cases, we shall assume m,n ~ i. We are interested 
in the following problems: Problem R: Given input E(D), determine if D has a non- negative integral solution. 
 Problem F: Given input E(D), output 0 if D has no non- negative integral solution; otherwise, output 
 bin(Yl~ ... #bin(Yn)#bin(x), where (yl,...,Yn,X) is some nonnegative~integral solution of D. (bin(y) 
= binary encoding of y.) Let I be any positive integer and let Rl and Fl be the problems R and F restricted 
to systems D satisfying IE(D) I ~ ~ d. We shall show that F is solvable and for any positive integer 
~, Rl is NP- complete. We shall also see that F% is solvable in deterministic polynomial time if and 
only if P = NP. (P and NP are the classes of languages accepted by deterministic and nondeterministic 
polynomial time-bounded Turing machines, respec- tively.) In contrast, F has exponential time com- plexity 
for infinitely many E(D)'s. To see this, xd+l consider systems of the form DI: Yl 2 i. Then the 'smallest' 
solution to D 1 is (Yl,X) = (2d-1,2). Any reasonable encoding E will have IE(DI) I ~ c logd for some 
c (independent of d). But the time to output the binary encoding of (2d-1,2) is 0(d). Thus, the time 
to solve F is exponential in IE(DI) I for infinitely many systems D 1 (obtained by varying d). We are 
unable to show that R is in NP since at present the only method we know of determining if a system D 
has a non- negative integral solution is to 'guess and check' a solution. However, systems of the form 
Yl = xd+l --~---1 make the process exponential. The paper has five remaining sections. Sec- tion 2 
consideres the special case of linear Diophantine equations and proves an interesting property of linear 
equations needed in the proof of the main theorem. Section 3 derives some bounds on small solutions for 
systems in which ui(x) has the form Pi(X) or [Pi(X)], Pi(X) a poly- nomial in x with rational coefficients. 
Section 4 extends these bounds for the general case. Sec- tion 5 contains the solvability and NP-completeness 
 proofs. Finally, Section 6 briefly mentions some recent results connecting Diophantine equations and 
counter machines. 2. The linear case In this section, we shall derive an interest- ing property of 
linear Diophantine equations which is very important in subsequent development. We begin by recalling 
some fundamental concepts in linear programming. Let Ay = a be a system of linear equations, where A 
is an m x n matrix of real numbers (posi- tive, negative, or zero), ~ = (yl,...,yn), and ~ = (Ol,...,Om), 
each o i a real number. An n-tuple of real numbers r = (rl,...,rn) is called a feasible solution to the 
system if each r. is nonnegative 1 and A~ = $. Suppose that n > m and m is the rank of A (i.e., the 
rows of A are linearly independent). Let 1 < £i < ~2 < "'" < £ < n be some column --m -- indices of 
A such that the submatrix B formed by columns £1,...%m is nonsingular (determinant of B # 0). The variables 
Y£1 '''''y£m are called basic variables while the remaining n-m variables are called nonbasic variables. 
If in the system Ay = ~ we set each nonbasic variable to zero and solve for the basic variables, the 
solution obtained for the yi's together with the zero's for the nonbasic variables form a basic solution. 
Clearly, a basic solution has at least n-m vari- ables that are zero. Also, there are at mostC~~ basic 
solutions since there are these many choices of the submatrix B. If in a basic solution each basic variable 
is nonnegative, the solution is called a basic feasible solution. The following is a fundamental theorem 
of linear programming (see, e.g., [12]): Theorem I. Let A T = ~ be a system of linear equa- tions, where 
A is an m x n matrix of real numbers, 7°= (yl,...,yn) , and ~ = (~i ..... Om) , each a i a real number. 
Let n > m and m be the rank of A. Then the system has a feasible solution if and only if it has a basic 
feasible solution. The next theorem is a generalization of a similar result given in [ii]. There~ only 
systems with nonnegative integral matrices A and nonnega- tive integral vectors $ were considered. Our 
proof follows the lines in [ii]. We give a separate proof since important details were omitted in [ii], 
and the discussion in [ii] does not suffice to make it clear that our generalization holds. In particular, 
the use of the fundamental theorem of linear programming in our proof supplies a very importnat detail. 
 Theorem 2. Consider a system of linear Diophan- tine equations: A T = ~, where A is an mxn integral 
matrix and $ = (Ol,...,Om) is an integral vector. Let n > m and m be the rank of A. Denote by A the maximum 
of the absolute values of all m x m subdeterminants of A. If the system has a nonnegative integral solution 
(91 .... ,yn) then it also has a nonnegative integral solution, (91,..., 9n ) such that for some set 
of indices L = {ZI''''' £m } c {i .... ,n}, yk < A for each k ~ L. Moreover, the submatrix formed by 
columns £i,...,£m of A is nonsingular (i.e., it has rank m). Proof. If n = m there is nothing to do. 
So assume that n > m and a nonnegative integral solu- tion (91.... ,gn) exists. We shall show how we 
can find the solution (yl,...,gn). We consider cases. case i. n = m + i: Clearly, (yl,...,yn) forms 
a feasible solu- tion to Ay = ~. By Theorem i, we can find a basic feasible solution (y~ ..... y~), 
i.e., (i) (Yl ..... ') satisfies A T = $, (ii) yj ! > 0 for 1 < j < n, Yn (iii) for some t, Yt ' = 
O, and (iv) the submatrix B formed by columns I, .... t-l,t+l,...,n is nonsingu- lar. Let ~t denote 
the determinant of B. If Yt is fixed, then the values of the other variables are uniquely determined 
by AT = 5. Using Cramer's rule, we can get the following form for the other variables: dj + ejy t yj 
= ~ , j=l,...,t-l,t+l,...,n t d. where 6t, dj, ej are integers and yj V = ~ 0 for j = l,...,t-l,t+l,...,n. 
By changing the sign of ej, if necessary, we may assume that dj, ~t ~ O. Now since (91 ..... yn) is 
a nonnegative integral solution, we have d.+ ~ = 3 eJ yt Yj ~ , j=l .... ,t-l, t+l .....n . t Let 
m t be the largest nonnegative integer such that Yt = mt~t + Yt for some nonnegative integer 9 t < 
8 t Then yj becomes d. + ^ 9j --J ejYt-" + ejm t , j=l ..... t-l,t+l .... ,n . 8t Since ~j, dj, ~t' 
Yt and m t are nonnegative integers, dj + ej~ -~-is also a nonnegative integer for t j=l,...,t-l,t+l,...,n. 
The desired solution is 91 ..... 9 n case 2. n > m + i: Arbitrarily choose m+l columns such that the 
submatrix formed by the columns has rank m. For notational convenience, let the columns chosen be l,...,m+l. 
Let A = (aij). Form the m equations: m+l m+l j=[laijyj = j=~laijyj , i=l .....m . Clearly, these equations 
satisfy the conditions of case i. Hence, there is a nonnegative integral solution (y~.... ,Ym+l such 
that for some t, y~ < )* 8t = determinant of the nonsingular submatrix formed by colums l,...,t-l,t+l,...,m+l. 
Let Yt = y~. Then we can fix the value of Yt at Yt and write the original system Ay = ~ as n j=[laijYj 
= °i -air Yt ' i=l,...,m . j#t The new system has n-i unknowns and rank m. It also has a nonnegative 
integral solution (y~,..., ,yn ) Hence, we can ' * .. ,Y~+I,Ym+2,*. . . Yt-i Yt+l ' . . ~ iterate 
the process n-m times and use Cramer's rule to obtain the desired solution (Yl .....Yn )" [] If Ay 
= ~ is a system of linear Diophantine equations and m is the rank of A, m < n, let A(~) denote the maximum 
(minimum) of the absolute values of all nonzero mxm subdeterminants of A. Let ~(F) be the maximum of 
the absolute values of all non- zero ( m x m) subdeterminants of the augmented matrix formed by A and 
vector 5. Clearly, i < S < A < F < ~. It was recently shown in [I], using a ~ different technique, that 
if Ay = ~ has a nonnega- tive integral solution, then it has a nonnegative integral solution (YI'''''Yn) 
such that Yi < m~(n~ + 1 -~) for i < i < n. A straightforward analysis of the proof of Theorem 2 yields 
a smaller bound : Corollary. Assume the above notation and that of Theorem 2. If Ay = ~ has a nonnegative 
integral solution, then it has a nonnegative integral solu- tion (Yl.... ,yn) such that Yk < A for each 
k ~ L _ ^ ~ F . . . (n-m-l)&#38; 2 . ana yj ~ ~ ~ a t ~ ~or each j eL. 3. The case when oi(x) = Pi(x) 
or LPi(x)J , Pi(X) a polynomial in x with rational coefficients We begin with the following lemma. 
Lemma i. Let p(x) = ClOl(X ) + ... + Cm+lOm+l(X), where Cl,...,Cm+ 1 are integers and for 1 < i < m+l, 
o.(x)l is either Pi(X) or Lpi(x)j, pi(x) a polynomial with rational coefficients. We can effectively 
 find nonnegative integers ~ and B such that for all x > e, p(x) is negative, zero or positive if and 
only if p(x+B) is negative, zero or positive, m+2 respectively. Moreover, ~ ! 2d(m+l)cv and B v (m+l) 
t , where c = max{abs(ci) I i < i < m+l}, d = max{d i I d i = degree of Pi(X), 1 < i < m+l}, v 1 v = 
max{abS(Vl),abs(v 2) I v~ is a coefficient in Pi(X), 1 < i < m+l}, t = max{t i I t i = number of nonzero 
coefficients of Pi(X), 1 < i < m+l}. Proof. If c = 0, then there is nothing to prove.  ui(x) = -- 
 So assume c > O. Write Pi(X) e. , where e i I is the least positive integer such that ui(x) is a polynomial 
with integral coefficients. (If Pi(X) = 0 then ui(x ) = 0 and e i = i.) Let qi(x) = el... ei_lei+l...em+lUi(X) 
and B = el...em+ I. Since e. < v t, it follows that B < v (m+l)t. If r = i -- --X remainder of abs(qi(x)) 
divided by B, let =Jr x if r x --0 or qi(x) >_ 0 mod(qi(x),B) l 8-r x if r x > 0 and qi(x) < 0 Then 
we have qi (x) Pi (x) = B =IPi (x) if Oi(X) = Pi(X) m°d(qi(x)'S)B if oi(x) = LPi(x)J,  %(x) [ pi(x) 
 m+l (x) = ciPi(X) -h(x), where i=l mod(qi(x), B) h(x) = [c i B i such that  O.l(X)= Lpi(x)J  -208- 
m+l abs(h(x)) < [ abs(ci). i=l We consider 2 cases. m+l case i. ~ ciPi(X) is not a constant. In this 
i=l case, we can find an ~ such that (*) either O(x) > 0 for all x > ~ or p(x) < 0 for all x > ~. 
To see this, we note that there exist a positive integer k < d and rational coefficients al,...,~+l 
 with a I # 0 such that m+l i=lciPi(x) = alxk + a2xk-i + ... + akx + ak+ 1 Clearly, 1 abs(al) >__ 
~ and abs(ai) <__ (m+l)cv for v 2 < i < k+l. Hence, there exists a nonnegative integer e such that 
for x > ~, re+l abs( [ ciPi(X)) = abs(al xk + a2 xk-I + ... + i=l akx + ak+ 1) 1 k k-i > --~ x -k(m+l)evx 
v (x -k(m+l)cv(m+2))x k-I m+l v and m+l k-i abs(h(x)) < abs(ci) < (m+l)c < (m+l)cx i=l It follows 
that for (*) to hold for all x > ~, it is sufficient to have (x_k(m+l)cv(m+2))x k-I v(m+l) ~ (m+l)cx 
k-l, i.e., x > (m+l)cv (re+l) + k(m+l)cv (m+2) . Since k ~ d, we see that e ! 2d(m+l)cvm+2" m+l case 
2. [ ciPi(X) is a constant, say f. Then i=l p(x) = f -h(x). Choose ~ = 0. Then for all x > and 1 < i 
< m+l, mod(qi(x+8),8 ) = mod(qi(x),8). Hence, p(x+8) = p(x) for all x > ~.[] Example. Consider p(x) 
= [31 + t2-~l--J -[x~] _ [-~] . Then p(3n) = O, p(3n+l) 1, and p(3n+2) -1 for all integers n > O. We 
can choose ~ = 0 and 6 = 3. The next lemma considers only one equation and  shows how a 'smaller' solution 
can be found from a given solution. Lemma 2. Consider an equation of the form 6y = 0(x) = ClOl(X) 
+ ... + Cm+lqm+l(X) where 6 is a positive integer and p(x) is as in Lemma i. Let e and 8 be the integers 
defined in Lemma 1 and y be a positive integer. Suppose e' >__ is an integer and there are nonnegative 
integers > s' and y satisfying ~y = p(x). Then for any  integer r > 0 such that x = x -r6~y > e', x 
and p (Xr)-- r --r Yr = ~ also form a nonnegative integral solu- tion to 6y = 0(x). Proof. For notational 
convenience assume that ui(x) each o.~(x) = [Pi(X)]. Write Pi(X) = ei for the least positive integer 
e i such that ui(x) is a polynomial with integral coefficients. Let qi(x)= el...ei_lei+l...em+lUi(X) 
and 8 = el...em+ I. Then qi(x) Pi (x) =--T--and 6y = 0(x) = Clql(X) + ... + Ca+lOre+ 1 (x) becomes (*) 
~y = eli--y-- j + ... + Ca+ I  By Lepta i, 6 <_ v (m+l)t and there exists a non- negative integer e 
<_ 2d(m+l)cv (m+2) such that for all x >_ ~, p(x) = c IL 8 J + "'" + Cm+l is negative, zero or positive 
if and only if p(x+8) is negative, zero or positive, respectively. Suppose that e' > e and (y,x) is a 
nonnega- tive integral solution such that i >__ e'. Let r >__ 0 be any integer such that x = i -r86y 
> e'. We (x r) =  shall show that x r and Yr 6 also form a non- negative integral solution. From (*) 
we have  1 ~v I Iqi(x) ^ l ~, : ~- iLlCiL---T -] m+l qi(Xr) m+l i:ici . : for some integers dl,...,dm+ 
I. Since y and cid i 1  -±U~ic qi(Xr) is also an integer. are integers, ~ i=l iL B J  > ~' > Also, 
it is nonnegative by Len~na i since x r _ _ P (x r) ~. It follows that x r and Yr = ~ also form a nonnegative 
integral solution to ~y = p(x). []  The next theorem is the main result of this section. Theorem 3. 
Consider a system of equations of the form  A~ = ~(x) where A is an m xn matrix of rational constants, 
 = (Yl ..... yn ) and $(x) = (Ol(X) ..... am(X).) , each oi(x) = Pi(X) or Lpi(x)J, pi(x) a polynomial 
with rational coefficients. If the system has a non- negative integral solution then it has a nonnega-

2) I v2 is a coefficient of Pi(X), 1 < i < m}, t = max{t i I t i = number of nonzero coefficients of 
Pi(X), i < i < m}. Proof. Consider first the case when A = 0 (i.e., $(x) = 0). Then we need only show 
a bound for x. If for some 1 < i < m, oi(x ) = c # 0 (c a rational constant) then the system is inconsistent, 
and there is no nonnegative integral solution. So we  may assume that ~i(x) = Pi(X) or Lpi(x)J and degree 
 (Pi(X)) >__ i. Clearly, a solution to o(x) = 0 is m also a solution to the equation [ oi2(x) = 0, and 
i=l conversely. Referring to the proof of Lemma i, we mt know that there exists a positive integer B 
< v  such that = [Pi(X) if Oi(x) = Pi(X) Oi(x) [ pi(x) mod (qi(x) ,B) S if Oi(x) = LPi(x)J qi (x) 
where Pi(X) = , 8 Now consider any 1 < i < m such that o.(x) = 1 Lpi(x_ )J . Then there is some 1

rational coefficients al,...,ak.+l with i a 1 # 0." Note that ak +1 is a function of 1 mod(qi(x),8). 
Clearly, abs( ) > 1 a 1 --V--~ abs(aj) ~ v for 2 < j < ki, abs(ak.+l) ~v+l. i Then ~p m°d(qi(x)'B)12

< 8md2v 4m. It follows that if x satisfies $(x) = 0, then x < ~". Now consider the case when A # 0 
and A has integral entries. Assume for now that n > m and m is the rank of A. Suppose that A T = ~(x) 
has'a nonnegative integral solution. Then there exists a nonnegative integer ~ such that the system 
Ay = o(x) has a nonnegative integral solution in yl,...,y n. Then by Theorem 2, A~ = o(x) has also a 
non- negative integral solution (yl,...,yn) such that for some set of indices L = {£1,...,%m}, Yk < A 
for each k ~ L, A being the maximum of the abso- lute values of all m x m subdeterminants of A. Moreover, 
the submatrix B formed by the columns  -210- ~i .... '£m is nonsingular. Hence Ay = $(~) reduces to

that we have assumed that the matrix A has integral entries. If A has rational entries, then we could

h < a mn and each entry mn  in hA is bounded by a The factor h in h$(x) will be taken into account

observe that the bounds above remain the same for the case when the rank of A is less than m. 4. The 
general case To handle the general case when o.(x) = ri(x) 1 or .-~ri(x)| , where r. (x) is a ratio 
of 2 polynomials 1 with rational coefficients, we need the following lemma whose proof is omitted. 
 - Lemma 3. Let r(x) = s(x) q(x) where z(x) = p(x) + z(x) ' s(x), z(x), p(x) and q(x) are polynomials 
with rational coefficients such that q(x) # 0 and 0 < degree (q(x)) < degree (z(x)). Then we can effec- 
tively find nonnegative integers x I and x 2 such that (i) if r(x) = s(x)  z(x) is an integer then 
x < Xl;  (ii) for all x > x 2 ,  if sign I q(x2)~    'Lp(x)J z<- 7))is [r(x)J = Is~--~l = nonnegative 
or if p<x) [z(x)J is not an integer. [p (x)-lJ otherwise. Moreover, x I <__ 3(bd) 12d3, x 2 <_ 3(bd) 
12d3, ~b4 <__ 4d 2 abs(nonzero coefficient of p(x)) <_ (bd) , and the degree of p(x) is less than 
d; d= max{degree of s(x), degree of z(x)} and b = max{abS(bl) , bl abs(b 2) I b~2 is a coefficient 
in s(x) or z(x)}. We are now ready to prove our main theorem. Theorem 4. Consider a system of simultaneous 
nonlinear equations of the form D: Ay = $(x), where A is an m xn matrix of rational constants,  = (Yl.....yn 
) and $(x) = (Ol(X) ..... Om(X)), each oi(x) = ri(x) or [ri(x)J, ri(x) a rational func- tion of x with 
rational coefficients. Let E(D) be some standard binary encoding of D and £ = IE(D) I. Let a! a = max{abs(al),abs(a2) 
I a2 an entry in A}, b 1 b = max{abS(bl),abs(b2) I b~2 a coefficient in ri(x), i < i < m}, d = max{dl,d 
2 I d I = degree of s(x), d 2 = degree  s (x) of z(x),ri(x ) = ~ , 1 < i < m}. If A T = ~(x) has a 
nonnegative integral solu- tion, then there is a nonnegative integral solu- tion (Yl..... Yn,X) such 
that yl,...,Yn,X < f(m,n, a,b,d) = (2ab)(2mn(d+l))C for some nonnegative  integer constant c which 
does not depend on D. Moreover, the iength of the binary representation of f(m,n,a,b,d) is bounded by 
a polynomial Q(£,d) in variables Z and d, where the degree of the polynomial Q does not depend on D. 
Proof. First, assume that A is an integral matrix. There are three cases to consider. case i: For 1 
< i < m, ri(x) = Pi(X), Pi(X) a polynomial with rational coefficients. By Theorem 3, if the system 
D has a nonnegative integral solution, then there exists also a nonnegative integral solution (yl,...,Yn,X) 
with Yi ~ 2 2tv(mna) 5m n(~+B~)d and x < ~+B~, where 2 8d2( )5m nv4m = mna B = v (m+l)tn , 2 = 
(ma)m n Clearly, v = b and t < d+l. So the first part of the theorem holds for this case. The next 
two cases take care of the situation when not all of the r.(x)'s are polynomials. 1 case 2: 0 < x < 
3(bd) 12d3. For 0 < x^ < U 12d 3 (d+l) bx d 3(bd) 'abs (ri(x0)) < d+l <-- (d+l)b(3(bd)12d3)d < (3bd) 
15d4 while for x 0 =0, b b21 abs(ri(x0)) < .-~ = Similarly, the nonzero lower bounds on the absolute 
value of ri(x0) are i i (3bd)lSd 4 and 7 ' respectively. Thus, for a given x = x 0 this case reduces 
to case 1 by letting v = (3bd) 15d4 and t = i. case 3: x > 3(bd) 12d3. Then by Lemma 3 each  r.(x)1 
can be represented by a polynomial Pi(X) with degree at most d with nonzero coefficients i whose absolute 
values are between and b4d 2 (bd) 4d2 + i. (The '+i' is needed to handle the [p(x)-lJ of Lemma 3.) 
So this case reduces to case i 4d 2 by letting v = (bd) + I, t < d + 1 and e = max{Sd2(mna)Sm2nv 4m, 
3(bd) 12d3 + 1}. The bound for x follows from equation (%) in the proof of 12d 3 Theorem 3 and the 
fact that x > 3(bd) If A is a rational matrix, we can transform the system A T = $(x) to an equivalent 
system (hA)y = h$(x), where h is the least integer such that hA is an integral matrix. Clearly, the entries 
of hA are bounded by a mn while the coeffi- cients of the polynomial ho.(x) are bounded by l ba mn. 
However, it is obvious that the form of the mn bound f(m,n,a,b,d) remains the same when a and ba mn 
are substituted for a and b, respectively. In a standard binary representation of D, log2a, log2b, 
log2d, m, and n are no greater than £. So Q(Z,d) can be derived from the bounds f(m, n,a,b,d). [] 5. 
Solvability and NP-completeness results The existence of bounds for small solutions derived in Theorem 
4 can be used to solve problems R and F. The next theorem shows that R is decidable and R E is NP-complete. 
 Theorem 5. R is decidable. Moreover, for any positive integer E, R E is NP-complete. Proof. By Theorem 
4, we can easily construct a nondeterministic algorithm to solve R whose time complexity is Cl(Q(E,d)) 
c2 for some constants C 1 and c 2. (The algorithm when given input E(D) just guesses the values of 
yl,...,Yn,X in the range 0 to f(m,n,a,b,d) and checks that they satisfy the system.) Hence, R is decidable. 
If IE(D) I E = £E d, then cl(Q(£,d))C2 is bounded by some fixed polynomial in £ = IE(D) I. Hence, 
R E is in NP. That Rk is NP-hard is obvious since R% restricted to single equations of the form ay = 
c -bx 2 (a,b, c nonnegative integers) is already NP-hard [13]. Since R E is NP-hard and in NP, it is 
NP-eomplete~ From Theorem 5 and the fact that linear inte- ger programming (i.e., problem R restricted 
to systems of linear Diophantine equations) is NP- hard [16], we have Corollary. The linear integer 
programming problem is NP-complete. We now give an algorithm to solve F. Al$orithm F!ND Input: D: 
Ay = $(x), A is an mxn matrix of rational constants (m,n ~ i), y = (yl,...,yn), ~(x) = (of(x) .....On(X)), 
 Oi(x ) = ri(x ) or [ri(x)J, ri(x) a rational function of x with rational coefficients. Output: nonnegative 
integers yl,...,Yn,X sat- isfying D if they exist; 0 otherwise. For convenience, x will be referred 
to as Yn+l" //In the following, L(I : n + i), U(I : n + i), and M(I : n + i) are integer arrays which 
 will be used to denote the range of values of Yi,i=l,...,n+l. f(m,n,a,b,d) is the bound on a 'small' 
solution as defined in Theorem 4. The algorithm uses the method of bisection to find (yl,...,yn,Yn+ 
I) if a solu- tion exists. The subalgorithm SOLUTION (D,M, U) determines if a solution (yl,...,yn,Yn+l) 
exists such that M(i) ~ Yi ~ U(i), i=l .... , n+i// for i ÷ 1 to n+l do L(i) + M(i) ÷ 0 U(i) ÷ f(m,n,a,b,d) 
end if no SOLUTION (D,M,U) then [output ('0'); stop] for i ÷ 1 to n+l do repeat M(i) ÷   IL(i)+U(iZJ2 
 if SOLUTION (D,M,U) then L(i) ÷ M(i) else U(i) ÷ M(i)-i until U(i) -L(i) < 1 M(i) ÷ U(i) if no SOLUTION 
(D,M,U) then M(i) ÷ L(i) end output (M)  end FIND For convenience, algorithm SOLUTION is written as 
a nondeterministic algorithm: Algorithm SOLUTION (D,M,U) //Given the system D: A T = $(x), return 'yes' 
if there are nonnegative integers yl,...,yn,Yn+ 1 = x satisfying D such that M(i) ! Yi !U(i)' i=l .... 
, n+l; otherwise, return 'no'//  Guess integer values for yl,...,yn+ 1 such that M(i) Yi ! U(i) for 
1 < i < n + 1 If (yl,.,.,Yn+l) satisfies D then return ('yes') else return ('no')  end SOLUTION We 
can now determine the time complexity of the 2 algorithms on multitape Turing machines. Nondeterministic 
time complexity of SOLUTION: The input to SOLUTION is of the form E(D)#E(M)#E(U), where E(M) and E(U) 
are the binary encodings of the arrays M and U. Now if £ = IE(D) I, then the binary encoding of f(m,n,a,b,d) 
! Q(£,d) (see Theorem 4). It follows that SOLUTION has non- deterministic time complexity ! Cl(Q(£,d)) 
c2 for some fixed constants c I and c 2. Deterministic time complexity of FIND: The deterministic time 
complexity of FIND < c3n(log2f(m,n,a,b,d))T(D) ~ c4Q2(£,d)T(D), where T(D) represents the deterministic 
time complexity of SOLUTION, and c3, c 4 are some fixed constants. Theorem 6. F is solvable and for 
any positive integer %, F% is solvable in deterministic poly- nomial time if and only if P = NP. Proof. 
Algorithm FIND shows that F is solvable. Let % be a positive integer. If F% is solvable in deterministic 
polynomial time, then so is R%. Hence P = NP since R% is NP-complete. Now suppose P = NP and IE(D) I 
~ = ~ ~ d. Then SOLUTION will have deterministic time complexity c5(Q(Z,d))C6 for some constants c 5 
and c 6, and FIND will have deterministic time complexity ! c7(Q(Z,d))e8 for some constants c 7 and c 
8. It follows that F% can be solved in deterministic polynomial time.[] 6. Diophantine equations and 
counter machines Some relationships between number-theoretic decision problems and decision problems 
concerning counter machines have recently been obtained in [5,6,8]. For completeness, we mention below 
the relevant results. Let C(k) be the class of deterministic two- way finite automata augmented by k 
finite-turn counters. The machines are restricted to accept only bounded languages (i.e. subsets of a~...a* 
 ' n for some n ~ 1 and distinct symbols al,...,an).  The following results were shown in [5,6,8]: 
 (I) The emptiness problem for C(2) is solvable if and only if Hilbert's tenth problem is solvable. 
Hence, C(2) has an unsolvable emptiness problem.  (2) The emptiness problem for C(1) is solvable if 
 and only if determining the existence of a nonnegative integral solution for a system of Diophantine 
equations of the following form is solvable: r a..x.+b. j=l l] 3 i Yi r i=l'2'''''m j=lc°.x.+d.i3i 
m,r . . . . b i cij d i ~ 3 > i, aij are integers.  (3) Denote by C(k,l) the class C(k) restricted 
to an alphabet containing only 1 symbol. Then C(k,l) has decidable emptiness, infiniteness, disjointness, 
and containment problems. Non- trivial number-theoretic decision problems can be solved by machines 
in C(k,l). For example, the problem of determining if a system of the form D: A T = ~(x) (where A, Y, 
and ~(x) are as defined earlier) has a non- negative integer solution can be shown solv- able by constructing 
a machine in C(k,l) that accepts the set L(D) = {i x I there exist non- negative integers yl,...,Yn,X 
satisfying AT = o(x)}. It can also be shown that determining if Ay = ~(x) has an infinite number of 
non- negative integral solutions is solvable.  (4) Let L _.al..C .a*n and Q(L) = {~l'''''i n ) I * 
il .a~ n in L } Then the following state- a I .. ments are equivalent: (i) L is accepted by a machine 
in C(k) (for some k) whose input is also finite-turn.  (ii) L is accepted by a machine in C(1) whose 
  input is also finite-turn.  (iii) Q(L) is a semilinear set. The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) had 
also been implicitly shown in [ii]. Acknowledgments  We would like to thank Steve Cook for bring-
