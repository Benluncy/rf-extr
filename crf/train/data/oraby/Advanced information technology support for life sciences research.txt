revolution in life sciences research brought about by the sequencing of the human genome creates new 
challenges for scientists and new opportunities for computing support organizations. This may involve 
significant shifts in computing support strategies, particularly as regards interacting with life sciences 
researchers who maintain a medical practice. This paper describes Indiana University s experience in 
a large-scale initiative in supporting life sciences research, as well as several strategies and suggestions 
relevant to colleges and universities of any size. Computing organizations and support professionals 
have many opportunities to facilitate and accelerate life sciences research.  Categories and Subject

 1. INTRODUCTION Indiana University announced in 2000 the Indiana Genomics Initiative [1], a major effort 
to enable new treatments for human disease and to improve human health. This initiative involved a significant 
information technology component. The purposes of this paper are: to describe the steps taken by Indiana 
University's University Information Technology Services (UITS) in support of life sciences research; 
to identify key lessons learned; and to suggest strategies that colleges and universities of any size 
may employ to enhance life sciences research. This paper first describes some of the hardware facilities 
implemented by Indiana University (IU) in support of life sciences research. Systems without adequate 
support are doomed to be used poorly [2]; therefore, this paper also describes strategies and some new 
applications developed to support life sciences research. As a result of these efforts, IU medical researchers' 
use of advanced IT facilities has increased one hundredfold during the past two years. During May 2003, 
researchers from the IUPUI campus (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, which includes 
the IU Medical School) for the first time used more CPU hours than researchers from IU s Bloomington 
campus (IUB). This is noteworthy Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). SIGUCCS 03, September 21 24,

most of the researchers in fields that traditionally make heavy use of supercomputers (e.g. physics, 
astronomy, and chemistry) are located at IUB. Results of the annual UITS survey of computer user satisfaction 
[3] also indicate progress. One question on this survey addresses overall satisfaction with UITS's research 
computing services. Respondents from the IU School of Medicine provided an average rating of 3.9 on a 
1-5 Likert scale (with 5 = excellent); 97.5% rated services as at least satisfactory (3 or higher). 
2. DISCUSSION 2.1 Advanced IT facilities for life sciences Many life sciences computing challenges require 
massive computational power and storage facilities. Indiana University upgraded its IBM SP supercomputer 
to a peak theoretical processing capability of 1 TFLOPS (one trillion mathematical operations per second) 
in large part to support life sciences research, and IU maintains other large HPC systems as well [4]. 
IU s computational systems are, overall, fairly centralized, and in particular there has not been a great 
proliferation of small Linux clusters on campus. This has led to greater value being received from equipment 
purchased by the University than might otherwise have been the case. In particular, computers in individual 
labs may sometimes be idle. Centralization of computing systems provides economies of scale and opportunities 
to increase levels of use for any university or college. Equipment can be centralized in a fashion that 
provides at-will access to equipment purchased by a particular research group, while making such resources 
available for general use when idle [5]. Many computational resources are also available via the World 
Wide Web. Many Web sites dedicated to the delivery of biomedical data provide significant computational 
capacity available without cost [e.g. 6]. Such facilities may provide significant help for smaller institutions 
in meeting the computational needs of biomedical researchers. For those researchers who require large-scale 
computing resources, allocations on national supercomputer centers are available without cost through 
a peer-review application process [7]. Furthermore, much of the software widely used in academic research 
is available as open source, and scripts that facilitate installation of several such packages are available 
[8]. As a result, given some investment in knowledgeable support staff, it is possible to deliver useful 
services in support of life sciences research at many levels of investment in computing systems. Life 
sciences research involves significant data storage challenges. IU manages a massive data storage system 
containing more than one terabyte of life sciences data [9]. An important aspect of IU s massive data 
storage system is that it is geographically distributed, including one robotic tape silo in Indianapolis 
and another in Bloomington roughly 50 miles apart. Data is generally copied to both locations simultaneously, 
ensuring that data will be preserved even in the event of a catastrophe destroying one of the machine 
rooms. This is particularly important in the case of life sciences data, which is essentially irreplaceable. 
It is possible to collect multiple data sets that are similar, but each is as unique as the individual 
creatures involved; a data set once lost is lost forever. Reasonably low-cost solutions exist for moderate-scale 
data storage problems, including off-site vaulting options that provide secure (albeit slow) data storage 
and recovery. To support visualization of biomedical data, IU has installed several immersive, 3D, virtual 
reality visualization environments. Relatively low-cost 3D display systems [10] can be installed in life 
sciences research labs, providing an opportunity for impromptu analyses of life sciences data at the 
convenience of the researcher. There are, then, a wide variety of options for meeting the computing, 
storage, and data visualization needs of biomedical researchers, spanning a range of scales and costs. 
However, all of these options require staff dedicated to supporting their use in order to successfully 
fill these needs.  2.2 Support for life sciences researchers The same general strategies previously 
described [2] for supporting high performance computing in academic research also work for life scientists, 
particularly provision of easy access to computing systems and consulting and programming support. One 
of the lessons learned early on was to adapt these support strategies to match the needs and work practices 
of life sciences researchers, especially medical researchers, who often stay active in clinical practice. 
This imposes stress and time constraints on their schedules rarely faced by researchers in other disciplines. 
Consequently, extra efforts are required to make advanced IT infrastructure accessible and valuable to 
these scientists. There is a chicken and egg problem regarding advanced IT facilities for life sciences. 
The life sciences do not have a long tradition of use of large-scale computing systems, as exists, for 
example, in physics and astronomy. A life scientist persuaded to try using advanced (and sometimes hard-to-use) 
information technology facilities will only continue to use these resources if they promise to increase 
his productivity. From the standpoint of the academic computing center, it may be difficult to justify 
the staff effort required to install and maintain a suite of software and data resources while waiting 
for life sciences researchers to begin making heavy use of such resources. It seems clear, however, that 
progress will be most rapid if the computing center takes the first step. One critical step in improving 
the perceived accessibility of Indiana University s computing systems was the creation of a suite of 
batch scripts for the software packages most often used by life scientists [11]. These scripts are designed 
to do what the life sciences researcher is most likely to want done and report to the user exactly what 
was done as part of the analysis. Determining the most appropriate behavior was the largest part of the 
work in creating these scripts. They are available for download and only minor modifications should be 
required to adapt them for use at other institutions. A second critical step in improving the accessibility 
of these facilities was the creation of a hardcopy document describing their use and how they could enhance 
the research programs of life sciences researchers [12]. This document was widely distributed within 
the IU School of Medicine, and has proven to be very useful largely because the hardcopy format made 
it easy for researchers to carry it around to read during spare moments, or refer to as they worked at 
their terminals. Also, a Web page specifically designed to help life sciences researchers navigate easily 
to the most critical Web-based information resources was created [13]. Finally, an aggressive outreach 
campaign followed, focused on visits to researchers labs and offices to ask them to describe their research 
activities, so that ways in which the university s advanced IT facilities could be put to use to the 
benefit of their research programs might become apparent. 2.3 Example software implementations Indiana 
University s software support strategies have extended beyond offering assistance with existing software 
to include optimization of software and creation of new software applications. Some software implementations 
have required significant effort, while others have been very straightforward. Some examples follow. 
Supercomputers enable many processors to work together to solve very large computational problems. They 
also enable many independent problems of more modest scale to be solved simultaneously. Programming support, 
involving the tuning and/or parallelization of existing software or the creation of entirely new software, 
has in some cases dramatically reduced the amount of time required for researchers to perform important 
analyses reducing processing time from days to hours or from hours to minutes. The capabilities of one 
researcher were enhanced substantially by the addition of a particular piece of software to the IBM SP 
supercomputer which enabled processing large numbers of data analyses concurrently. The researcher had 
previously been limited to processing just a few data sets at a time, one per PC in the researcher s 
lab. Using a supercomputer to process larger numbers of data sets simultaneously was simple to implement 
and very valuable to the researcher. Use of supercomputers both accelerates research and helps facilitate 
the transformation of experimental analyses into clinical practice. Considerations related to technology 
transfer may be complicated when dealing with life scientists. New and improved treatments are often 
put into use through commercialization, and this requires clarity in ownership of intellectual property. 
UITS employs written agreements defining the terms of extended consulting projects. When a UITS programmer 
creates a fundamentally new piece of software, UITS files an invention disclosure with Indiana University 
s technology transfer office. A CVS repository is maintained, in part because this is good programming 
practice and in part to help clarify ownership of intellectual property. No software has at this time 
been commercialized, but several life sciences applications have been released under the terms of LGPL 
or BSD licenses [14]. These licenses permit software to be exchanged as open source and still permit 
commercialization important because economic development is among the objectives of the Indiana Genomics 
Initiative [1]. Considerable effort has also been expended to address data management and visualization 
issues, which are particularly important given the burgeoning data stores now being made available to 
life sciences researchers. Indiana University has created a Centralized Life Sciences Data (CLSD) service, 
which provides a single, SQL-based interface for querying a variety of public biomedical databases and 
databases created within Indiana University [15]. UITS has also created several visualization applications 
for biomedical research [16­18]. There are a number of roles that computing organizations and professionals 
are uniquely positioned to fulfill that will lead to the enhancement of research in the life sciences 
and, in turn, better health for humans overall. As the life sciences become more and more dependent upon 
advanced information technology, proactive assistance from computing support organizations and professionals 
can dramatically accelerate life sciences research. Indiana University has used the strategies described 
here with significant success; the senior author (CAS) is currently visiting a supercomputing center 
in Germany [19] to assist with implementation of several of these strategies there.  3. CONCLUSIONS 
The support strategies identified here, particularly as regards interactions with life scientists, may 
be used successfully across a wide range of universities and colleges. There are likewise options available 
for meeting computational and storage needs that range in cost from free to modest. At the same time, 
some of the services Indiana University is able to provide are in part a result of significant investment 
and grant support. The possibility of providing such services is good grounds for seeking additional 
external or internal funding. There is at present an opportunity for computing support organizations 
and professionals to greatly accelerate life sciences research. Such progress will be most rapid if computing 
organizations and support professionals take the first steps in establishing service suites, and reach 
out actively searching for collaborations with life scientists. 4. ACKNOWLEGEMENTS This paper is dedicated
