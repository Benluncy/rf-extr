 An algebraic method to compute a shortest path of local flips between two tilings Eric Rdmila * Abstract 
A flip of a tiling T is a local transformation of T using a bounded number of tiles. For different kinds 
of tilings (formed from two bars (a horizontal and a vertical one), from triangles and "leaning dominoes", 
or from "calissous" ), we produce an algorithm of optimal time complexity which, given a pair (T, T r 
) of tilings of a same simply connected fig- ure, exhibits a length minimal sequence of flips to transform 
T into T'. These algorithms are based on the use of tiling groups, and of their quotients and subgroups. 
 Introduction In 1990, J. H. Conway and J. C. Lagarias [1] introduced the notion of tiling groups, which 
is a very powerful tool to study tiling problems. Using tiling groups, a lot of necessary conditions 
for a simply connected figure to be tileable (see [3], [4]) were discovered and unified. This work has 
been prolonged by W. P. Thurston [6] who especially studied tilings formed from dominoes (i. e. rectangles 
2 x 1) and tilings formed from calissons (i. e. lozenges formed from two equilateral triangles of unit 
side, with a common edge). For these examples, W. P. Thurston introduced the notion of height function 
associated to a tiling of a simply connected figure. Such a height function maps the tiling to the set 
Z of relative integers. Using this new notion, the set of tilings can be partially ordered, and a linear 
algorithms which, given a figure as input, produce a minimal tiling of this figure as output (ff there 
exists one tiling ; otherwise the claim of the impossibility is the output) are exhibited. W. P. Thurston's 
ideas have been taken again by C. and R. Kenyon [2], who obtained a tiling algorithm for the case when 
tilings are formed from m-bars (rectangles of length m and unit width), and E. R6mila [5], who obtained 
tiling algorithms for the case when tilings are formed from equilateral triangles of side of length 2 
and "leaning dominoes" (parallelograms formed from four equilateral triangles whose sides have unit length). 
In these papers, height functions appear as heights on special trees.  ENS-Lyon, CNRS umr 5668, 69364 
Lyon cedex 07, France and Grima, IUT Roanne, 42334 Roanne cedex, France Each of these authors also obtains 
that, given a tiling T of a simply connected figure, there exists a sequence of local transformations, 
called flips, which permit to transform T into the tiling produced by the algorithm. As a corollary, 
it follows that, given a pair (T, T') of tilings of a same simply connected figure, there exists a sequence 
of flips which permit to transform T into T ~. But this method does not give an optimal strategy (i. 
e. the strategy which uses a minimum number of flips) to transform T into T ~. In this paper, we improve 
the result stated above, exhibiting an algorithm which, given a pair (T,T ~) of tilings, produces a sequence 
of flips, of minimal length, which transforms T into T r. Moreover, this algorithm has an optimal time 
complexity : O(area of the tiled figure + length of the sequence produced) --O(size of input+size of 
output), since such an algorithm necessarily has, at least, to read the data and write a solution. The 
main tool introduced is a particular normal subgroup of the principal quotient group of the tiling group, 
called Ncell. This subgroup seems to be very useful in the theoretical and practical study of tilings. 
Thus, the algebraic methods used give some clarifica- tions about the structure of spaces of tilings. 
This paper is divided as follows : in section 2, we recall the general tools previously introduced by 
different authors. In section 3, we especially study tilings with bars, introducing the group Ncell, 
and precisely giving our algorithm. Section 4 is devoted to examples in the triangular lattice (leaning 
dominoes and triangles, calissons) for which we only give the general framework. 2 Tiling groups and 
tiling functions 2.1 Tilings Let A be the square lattice of the Eu- clidean plane. A (finite) figure 
F of A is a (finite) union of closed square cells of A. A figure F is simply con- nected if F and its 
complement R 2 - F both are con- nected. A finite simply connected figure F is called a polygon of A. 
The boundary of a polygon P canoni-cally induces a cycle in A, which is called the boundary cycle of 
P. A set S of prototiles is a fixed finite set of polygons of A. A tile is a translated copy of a prototile. 
A tiling T of a figure F is a set of tiles included in F, with pairwise disjoint interiors, such that 
the union of the tiles of T equals F. 2.2 Groups and their representation Let Z be the set {a, b, a -x, 
b-l), Fa, b be the free group generated by a, b and 7r denote the canonical surjection from the language 
E* of words with letters in ~ to Fa,b. Let R be a finite set of words of E*. The group NR denotes the 
normal group of Fa,b generated by the elements of ~r(R) and GR denotes the quotient group Fa,b/NR. The 
group GR has a classical graphic representation : the Cayley graph Ca is the directed graph with labeled 
edges with labels in {a, b}such that vertices of CR are elements of GR, and for each 3-uple (g, g', u) 
of elements of (GR) 2 x {a, b}, gu = g' if and only if there exists an edge of CR from g to g', labeled 
byu. Hence, the underlying graph of A can be seen as the Cayley graph Cceu = CR0, with Ro = {aba-Xb-t}, 
each element of {a, b} being associated to a unit move (a for a horizontal rightwards move, b for a vertical 
upwards move). By this way, each vertex of A is identified to an element of G~. 2.3 Tiling groups Let 
p = (Vo,Vx,...,vn) be a path of A, i. e. a sequence of vertices such that, for each integer i, with 0 
g i < p, there exists an element of E such that vlui = vi+x. The path word w(p) is the word uoux ... 
un-x. Moreover, if p is a boundary cycle of a polygon P, we say that w(p) is a contour word of P. Let 
S = {tl,t2,..., tn} be a set of prototiles. The tiling group of S is the group Gtile = GR, where R = 
wl, w2,..., wp and for each integer i such that 1 < i < p, wi is a contour word of ti. The tiling Cayley 
graph of S is the graph Ctite = CR. Remark that tiling groups and tiling Cayley graphs only depend on 
the set S, and not on the contour words chosen for each prototile. For So = {co}, where co denotes the 
unit cell of A, the tiling group Gceu of So is isomorphic to Z 2 and can be identified to A. 2.4 Tiling 
functions Let T be a tiling of a figure F. The graph GT of T is the subgraph of A(= Gceu = Z 2) generated 
by the set of edges which axe on boundaries of tiles of T (i. e. which cut no tile of T). DEFINITION 
2.1. let T be a tiling of a figure F. A tiling function induced by T is a mapping fT from the set VT 
of vertices of GT to Gtite such that, for each pair (v, u) of VT × {a, b), if the edge outgoing from 
v labeled by u is an edge of GT, then the equality : fT(VU) = fT(V)U holds. PROPOSITION 2.1. (J. H. Conway) 
let F be a figure of A, T be a tiling of F, vo be a vertex of GT and v~ be an element of Gtae. If F is 
connected (respectively is a polygon), then there exists at most one (respectively exactly one) tiling 
function fT induced by T such that fT(Vo) = v~. Proof. : (sketch) function fT can easily be constructed 
successively exploring the contour of each tile : function fT is first defined on the vertices of a tile 
to which has v0 on its boundary. Afterwards, fT is defined on the vertices of a tile tl which has a common 
vertex with to and so on. This method gives the uniqueness of fT, for F connected. Nevertheless, a conflict 
(i. e. a vertex v such that two distinct values of fT(V)) can arise if F has some holes, which yields 
that there is no tiling function. REMARK 2.1. : let P be a polygon and Vo be a vertex of the boundary 
of P. If f and f are tiling functions such that f(Vo) = f (Vo), then for each vertex v of the boundary 
4 P, f(v) = f(v). The use of tiling functions is a main method to study tilings. Interesting examples 
are developed in [1], [6], [4], [2], [3], [5]. We apply the theoretical notions on our special case 
below. 3 Application to tiHngs with two bars The first sets of prototiles on which we apply notions 
of the previous section axe (as in [2]) sets Sm,n = {hm, Vn}, where hm denotes an m x 1 horizontal rectangle, 
and vn denotes a 1 × n vertical rectangle (m and n being fixed positive integers). Thus, a set Rbars 
of contour words of prototiles is {amba-mb-1, bnab-na-1}, which gives a group GR = Gbars. Since this 
group has a complex structure, quotients groups of Ghats will be used, in order to have groups that can 
be easily described. This is an indirect way to understand the structure of ebars. 3.1 The quotient groups 
To obtain such a quotient group, it suffices to exhibit a set Rbars of words such that the words of Rbars 
are null in GR,. In this case, we have a natural surjection from Gbars to GR,. 3.1.1 The cycle group 
As in [2], the principal quotient group used is constructed from the auxiliary set R ~ = {a m, bn). Obviously, 
the elements of R are null in GR,, which guarantees that we have a canonical surjection s from GR to 
GR,. The structure of GR, is rather simple : GR, is isomorphic to the free product of a cyclic group 
of rn elements and a cyclic group of n 648 elements. The associated Cayley graph CR, is formed from directed 
cycles of length m with edges labeled by a and directed cycles of length n with edges labeled by b, each 
vertex being element of exactly two cycles, one of each type (see figure 1). Moreover, CR, is a tree 
of cycles : the only cycles of CR, are those described above. Thus we state CR, = Coyotes and GR, = Gcyctes. 
DEFINITION 3.1. (canonical expression, length and distance in the cycle group) For each ele- ment w of 
Gcyctes, there exists a unique finite sequence il i2 ip (xl,il,x2,i2,... ,xp, ip) such that w = x 1 
x 2 ...xp , for each integer j, xj is element of {a,b} , for i < p, xj ~ xj+l, and if xj = a (respectively 
x i = b), then 1 < ij < m (respectively 1 <_ ij < n). With these notations we say that x~x~:...xp ~ is 
the canonical expression of w, p is the length of w (denoted by l(w)) and the distance d(wt,w '') between 
two elements of Geycles is equal to l(w'-lw"). 3.1.2 The cell group Another quotient group of Gbars is 
the group Gceu defined from the set Ro = {aba-lb-1}. As we have seen before, this group is homeomorphic 
to Z2. 3.1.3 The torus group The third quotient group which will be used is Gtoru8 = GR" with R" = {a 
m, bn,aba-lb-1}. This group is isomorphic to Zm x Zn, i. e. the direct product of a cyclic group of m 
elements and a cyclic group of n elements : each element can be seen as a pair (i,j) of Z,n x Zn. The 
associated Cayley graph CR-is formed from directed cycles of length m with edges labeled by a and directed 
cycles of length n with edges labeled by b, in such a way that a and b commute. It has the structure 
of a torus Tmxn. Notice that Gto~us is also a quotient group of both Gc~cles and Gceu. 3.2 Tiling functions 
and tiling projectionsLet T be a tiling of a polygon P, and fT be a tiling function induced by T. Function 
gT, defined by : gT = SOFT, (where s denotes the canonical surjection from Gba~s to Gcucles) is called 
a tiling projection of T. Notice that, for a set of bars as set of prototiles, the set of vertices of 
GT is the set of vertices which are elements of P (since each vertex of P is on the boundary of a bar 
of T). Fix a vertex v0 of the boundary of P and assume that gT(vO) = 1. Let v be any vertex of P ; how 
can we compute gT(v) ? we have to take a path of P from v0 to v which cuts no tile of T, and, from the 
definitions of fT and gT, the word associated to this path, seen as an element of Gcyetes, is equal to 
gT(v) (see figure 1). REMARK 3.1. Let (v, v ~) be a pair of neighbor vertices Figure 1: Computation of 
gT(v), using the path from Vo to v, whose associated word is a2ba a (example with m = 4 and n = 3). of 
P. if the edge which join them is on the boundary of a bar, then d(gT(V),gT(V')) = l. 1~ Otherwise, this 
edge cuts a bar, then d(gT(v), gT(v')) ---- 3. Thus function gT completely gives the tiling T. Let T 
and T t be tilings of a fixed polygon P with bars, fT and fT, be tiling functions respectively induced 
by T and T'. We assume that there exists a vertex Vo of the boundary of P such that fT(vo) = fT' (V0) 
= 1. We will prove that, for each pair (v, v ~) of vertices of P, the values fT(v) and fT,(V') (and, 
consequently, the values gT(v) and gT' (Vl)) have a part of dependence. PROPOSITION 3.1. Let p (respectively 
p') be a path of P from vo to v which cuts no tile of T (respectively T') and let w (respectively w') 
be its associated word (hence in Gbars, we have w = fT(v) and w' = fT,(V')). In Gtorus, the element z 
= "w-lw ~ is equal to the element (i,j) of Zm × Zn, with i = (x~, -x~)mod[m], J = (Yv,-yv)mod[n], where 
x, (respectively x~,) denotes the first coordinate of vertex v (respectively v'), and y, (respectively 
Yv,) is the second coordinate of vertex v (respectively v' ). Proof. The word z is associated to a path 
from v to v ~. Thus, since Gtoru s is commutative, we have z = a(X.'-X~)b (yÈ'-y~) in Gtorus, which obviously 
gives the result. COROLLARY3.1. For each vertex v of P, gT(v)-lgT , (v) is element of the normal group 
Nceu of Gc~cl~s generated by {aba-lb-1). Proof. Let s ~ denote the canonical surjection from Gcyctes 
to Gtorus. In Gtorus, we have st[gT(v)-lgT'(V)] = Z and, in this special case, z is the contour word 
of a cycle, thus, in Gto~,, z = 1. This gives that gT(v)-lgT,(V) is element of s'-1{1} = Nc¢lt. The 
above corollary yields us to study the structure of N,,n. 3.3 Structure of Nceu Let Srect the subset 
of Geycles defined by Steer = {aibia-ib-J, biaib-ia-~, for 1 _< i < m and 1 < j < n}. One easily verifies 
that Srea is closed by inverse. PROPOSITION 3.2. The normal subgroup H of Fa,b generated by { aba- l 
b-1 } is equal to the subgroup Ho generated by the set {aibia-ib-J,bJaib-ia -~ for i and j elements of 
Z} (i. e. the contour words of the rectangles starting from a corner). The normal group Nc~n of Gcycte 
generated by {aba-lb -~} is the group generated by the elements of the set S~a. Proof. First, remark 
that aibia-ib -j = 1 in Gcen, since Gcen is commutative. Thus, in Fa,b, aibJa-ib -j is element of Ho. 
This argument also holds for bJaib-ia -j. This facts proves that the subgroup H0 is included in H. Conversely 
notice that : a(aibia-ib-J)a-1 = ai+l bj (a-i- 1 b-i bJa i+l)a-lb-ja - 1 ..~ (ai+lbJa-i-%-~)(biab-la-1). 
This proves that, if g is a generator of Ho whose first letter is a, then aga -1 is element of H0. Repeating 
the same argument, on easily proves that if g is a generator of H0 and x is an element of {a, b, a -1, 
b-l}, then xgx -1 is element of H0. This guarantees that H0 is normal, and, consequently, H is included 
H0 (since aba-lb -~ is a generator of Ho). The second part of the proposition is obvious by canonical 
projection, once it has been remarked that for each pair (i,j) of Z 2, there exists a pair (¢,j') of 
{0, 1,... ,m- 1} x {0, 1,...,n- 1} such that, in Gc~ctes, we have a i = a i' and a j = a j' . LEMMA 3.1. 
Let (tl,t2,...,tp) be a (non-empty) se- quence of elements of S~a such that, for each integer i such 
thatO<i<p, titi+~ ~ 1. Letw be defined by P t w : IIi= 1 i. We have l(w) > p + 3. Moreover, if tp = 
aitPa-ib -j (respectively tp = bia~b-Ja-i), then the canonical expression of w is uam-~b ~-j (respectively 
uba-Ja m-i) where u is an ele- ment of Geyetes whose canonical expression finishes by b (respectively 
a). Proof. By induction on the integer p. The result is obvious if p = 1. Assume that the result is true 
for each element w such that w is a product of p elements of S~ct. Let w' be an product of p + 1 elements 
of S~ect. we state w ~ = tlt2...tptp+l. By induction hypothesis, if tp = aibia-ib -j, the canonical expression 
of element w = tits.., tp is of type uarn-ib n-j, with u such that l(u) > p + 1 and the canonical expression 
of u finishes by b. Thus if t~-x = a~bZa-~b -t, then the canonical expression of w ~ is ua m-i' b n-j' 
akbtam-kb n-t, which yields : l(w') > p + 7. If t~-i = b~akb-ta -k, then we have w' = uam-ibn-J+takb-ta 
-k. If n -j + l is not a multiple of n, then we deduce : l(w') > p + 6. If n -j + l is a mul- tiple of 
n (which yields that j = l, since 0 < j < n and 0 < l < n) and , then we have w' = uam-i+kb-ta -k. Notice 
that if i = k, then t~tp+~ = 1 which is a contra- diction, thus a m-i+/c y~ 1, which yields : l(w ~) 
> p + 4. The case when tp = b~a~b-aa -z can be treated in a similar way. COROLLARY 3.2. If w is an element 
of Ncen and w ~ 1, then l(w) > 4. Proof. obvious. COROLLARY 3.3. Let w be an element of Nceu. There exists 
a unique finite sequence (tl, t2,..., tp) of elements of Srect (called the decomposition of w), such 
that w = II~=lti and, for each integer i such that 0 < i < p, titi+l ~ 1. Proof. Assume that this corollary 
is false. Then there exists two distinct sequences (tl,t2,... ,tp) and , , , II~=lt i = rrp' ÷, (one 
can a~- (tl, t2, t r,) such that " " ~ ~j=l ~j sume without loss of generality that t~ ~ tp). Thus, 
II~=ltiII~'=l(tp,+l_k) -1 = 1. But, by the previous proposition, the length of this product is at least 
p + p' + 3, which is a contradiction. DEFINITION 3.2. (decomposition number of an el-ement of gcell ) 
The decomposition number of an el- ement w of Ncen (denoted by n(w)) is the number of factors of its 
decomposition. REMARK 3.2. lZrom the second part of the above lemma , if the canonical expression of 
an element w of Nceu is uakb z (respectively ubta k) where u is an element of Gcuaes whose canonical 
expression finishes by b (respectively a), then the last factor of the decomposition of w is am-kbn-tak-mbl-m. 
Repeating this operation, we obtain that the de- composition of w is computable in O(n(w)) (and, con-sequently, 
in O(l(w))) from the canonical expression of W. 3.4 Local flips Let T be a tiling of P. Assume that 
there exists an rn x n rectangle Ro such that T contains 650 a tiling To of R0 (in this case, tiles of 
To axe copies of the same prototile). Another tiling T/tip of P is obtained replacing tiles of To by 
tiles of T1, where T1 denotes the only tiling of R0 different from To. We say that Tftip is deduced from 
T by a local flip. If v is a vertex of P which is not in the interior of R0, then there exists a path 
from Vo to v which cuts not tile of T and does not go through the interior part of R0. This path also 
cuts not tile of Tftip. Thus, gT(V) ---- gTI,ip (V). If v is a vertex of P which is the interior of Re, 
let r0 be the lower left comer of Re. Let state i = x(v) -x(ro) andj --y(v)-y(ro). Assume that To is 
formed from hm tiles. Then we have gT(V) --- gT(v')bia i and gTstlp(v) = 9T(V')aib j. Thus gTt,lp(v) 
= gT(v)a-ib-Jaib j : a local flip induces a multiplication of the tiling projection of each interior 
vertex of Ro by an appropriate element of Srect It has been proved [2] that for each pair (T, T') of 
tilings of P, there exists a sequence of local flips which permit to deduce T ~ from T. We give more 
precision to this result, giving a formula for the minimal number minflip(T, T') of necessary flips. 
DEFINITION 3.3. (distance i~etween two tiUngs) Let (T, T ~) be a pair of filings of P, and let gw and 
gT, be the associated projections (such that gT(vo) = gT,(Vo) = 1). The distance A(T,T') is defined by 
the equality : A (T, T') = ~ n(gT, (V)-l gT(vi ) vEP PROPOSITION 3.3. For each pair (T, T') of tilings 
of P, we have A(T, T') <_ (m -1)(n -1)rain flip(T, T'). Proof. Let (T = To, T1,...,Tp = T') be a sequence 
of tilings such that, for 0 < i < p, T~+I is deduced from Ti p--1 by a local flip. We have A(T,T') <_ 
Ei=oA(Ti, Ti+l). From the study of local flips, we see that, for 0 _ i < p, A(T~,Ti+I) = (m -1)(n -1) 
: if v is not in the interior of the rectangle on which the flip is done, then gT, (V) = gTi+l (V), thus 
n(gT, (v)-l gTi+l (v) ) = 0; if v is in the interior of the rectangle on which the flip is done (we have 
(m-1)(n-1) such interior vertices), then gTi+~ (v) is obtained multiplying gTi (v) by an element of Srect, 
thus n(gTi (v)--l gTi+, (V) ) = 1. Thus A(Ti,Ti+I) = (m-1)(n -1), which yields that A(T,T') ~ (m-1)(n 
-- 1)p, which gives the result. We will prove that the inequality of the previous proposition is actually 
an equality. To do it, we have to exhibit a local flip in T which decreases A(T, T') of (m -1)(n -1) 
units. This flip will be done in the neighborhood of a special vertex which will be called an extremal 
vertex. 3.5 Extremal vertex We define the height function induced by a tiling T : let v be a vertex of 
P. The height hT(v) is equal to the length l(gT(v)) . DEFINITION 3.4. An extremal vertex for a pair {T, 
T'} of distinct filings is a vertex v of P such that 9T(V) ~£ gT' (V) and max[hT(v), hT, (v)] is maximal 
with the pre- vious condition. If, moreover, hT(v) >_ hT,(V), we say that v is T maximal. There exists 
such an extremal vertex (since other- wise gT = 9T', which yields that T = T'). Let Vl be an extremal 
vertex. It can be assumed without loss of generality that (Vl) s T maximal, (i. e. l(gT,(Vl)) <_ l(gT(Vl))). 
From corollary 2, we have : I(gT, (Vl )--l gT(Vl ) ) >_ 4, thus 2l(gr(vl)) _> I(gT'(Vl))+I(gT('I)) > 
> 4 We finally obtain : l(gT(Vl)) >__ 2. In other words, we can state aT(v1) = uaib j (or 9T(Vl) = ubiai), 
with 0 < i < m, 0 < j < n and, ff u ~ 1, then the canonical expression of u finishes by b (respectively 
a). LEMMA 3.2. Assume that 9T(Vl) = uaib j (respectively gT(Vl) = ubJai), with 0 < i < m, 0 < j < n and, 
if u ~ 1, then the canonical expression of u finishes by b (respectively a). Then we can state gT,(Vl)-lgT(Vl) 
= u'aib i (re-spectively gT,(Vl)-lgT(Vl) = u'bia i) with u' such that the canonical expression of u' 
finishes by b and l(u') ~ 2. Proof. If the canonical expression of gT,(Vl)-lgT(Vl) finishes by a, then 
the canonical expression of its inverse begins by a. Thus, since 9T(Vl) = uaib i, we have : l(gT, (Vl)) 
= l(gT(Vl ) ) -k I(9T(Vl )--l gT , (Vl)) which contradicts the hypothesis that l(gT,(Vl)) < l(gr(vl)). 
Thus the canonical expression of gT,(Vl)-lgT(Vl) finishes by b, we can state : gT,(Vl)-lgT(Vl) = u'akb 
l, with 0 < k < m, 0 < l < n and the canonical expression of u' finishes by b and l(u') > 2. With these 
notations, gT' (Vl) ----gT(Vl ) (gT(Vl )--l gT , (V 1)) = uaibJ-l a-ku '-1 From this equality, we see 
that the only possibility to have l(gT,(Vl)) <_ l(9T(Vl)) is : j = l and i -----k, which gives the result. 
PROPOSITION 3.4. Let ro be the vertex of the plane defined by X(Vl) -x(ro) = i and y(vl) -y(ro) = j, 
is the lower left corner of an m x n-rectangle Ro such that T contains a tiling of Ro. Moreover, this 
tiling is formed from vertical (respectively horizontal) tiles and each vertex of the interior of Ro 
is an extremal vertex. Proof. Let v2 be the right neighbor of vl. By definition of function gT, there 
exists a unique integer l, such that 0 < l < n and gTiV2) = gT(vl)b-tab t = uaibJb-lab t. If we have 
l ¢ j, then hT(v2) > hT(Vl). Moreover, d(gT(V2),gTt(Vl)) > d(gT(Vl),gT,(Vl) _) 4 which yields that gT(V2) 
~ gT, iV2) (since, on the other hand, d(gT,(V2),gT,(Vl)) ~ 3). This contradicts the fact that Vl is extremal. 
Thus we necessarily have : j = l and gT iv2 ) = ua i+l b j If, moreover, v2 is an interior vertex of 
Ro, then i + 1 ¢ m, thus hT(v2) ---- hT(Vl) and d(gT(V2),gT,(Vl)) ----d(gT(Vl),gT,(Vl) _> 4, which gives 
: gT(V2) # gT'(V2). Hence, v2 is also an extremal vertex and we can repeat the argument for v3, the right 
neighbor of v2 and so on. The same kind of argument can also be used leftwards. This gives the tiling 
of Ro. Now let ~ be the upper neighbor of Vl. We have v ~ : gTiVll) b : ua/b/+l . gT(1) If v 1 ~ is 
an interior vertex of Ro, then j -}- 1 < n, thus hTiv~) = hT(v~). Moreover d(gT(V~ ), gT, (Vl ) ) = d(gT(Vx 
), gT,(Vl ) > 4, which gives gT(Vll) ¢ gT,(Vll). Hence, v~ is also an extremal vertex and this argument 
can be repeated for V"l, the upper neighbor of v~ and so on. The same kind of argument can also be used 
backwards, and from other vertices v2, v3,.., of the interior of Ro with the same second coordinate as 
vl. This gives the fact that each vertex of the interior of Ro is an extremal vertex. PROPOSITION 3.5. 
Let Tfup be the tiling deduced from T by a flip on Ro. We have the equality : A(Tftip, T') = A(T,T') 
-(m -1)(n -- 1) . Proof. Let v be any vertex of the interior of Ro. Let state x(v) -x(vo) = i' and y(v) 
-y(vo) = j'. it °t We have : gTi v) =., ua lg, which yields that gT,(v)-lgT(v) = Uvaib i', where uv 
is such that the canonical expression of uv finishes by b and l(uv) > 2. Thus the last factor of the 
decompo-sition of gT, iv)-lgT(v) is am-i'bm-fa¢-mbf-m. t it We also have gT,(v)-lgTfzip(V) : uvbJa, 
: thus gT,(v)-l gTf, p(v)(a'n-i' bm-f a¢-mbf -m) _--_ gT,(V)-lgT(V). Thus n(gT,(V)-lgT1,,~(v)) = n(gT, 
(V)-lgT(V)) -- 1, which gives the result. COROLLARY 3.4. For each pair (T, T') of tilings of P, we have 
A(T, T') = (rn - 1)in -1)minfliPiT , T'). 3.6 Algorithm The notion of extremal vertex permits to give 
an algorithm which, given a pair (T,T t) of tilings of a polygon gives a sequence (R1,R2,...,Rminflip(T,T')) 
of rectangles on which flips can successively be done, to go from T to T'. Informally, such a sequence 
is a space economic way to encode a shortest path of tilings from T to T ~. The algorithm is presented 
below : Input : a pair (T, T ~) of tilings of a same polygon P. Initialization : Construct a spanning 
tree rooted in a fixed vertex v0. When a new vertex v is reached, compute the canonical expressions 
of gT(V), gT,(V) gT' (v)-l gTiV) ) and raaZ( hTiv), hT, iv)), and place v in a "list of lists" such that 
each vertex v ~ is in a basic list corresponding to the value : rnax(hT(v'), hT,(V')), and those basic 
lists are ordered according to their decreasing corresponding values. A variable list L of rectangles 
stores rectangles used. The first part of this list is formed from rectangles of flips deduced from T 
and the second part from those of flips deduced from T ~. For initia]i~.ation, L is empty and each insertion 
is done just between both parts. We also need a variable vertex vx, which, for initialization, is the 
first element of the "list of lists" of vertices. Repeat : Take the first element of the "list of lists" 
for Vl. If gT(Vl) = gT' (Vl), then delete the value of vl from the "list of lists". Otherwise, vl is 
an extremal vertex, which (in the case when Vl is T-extremal, the symmetric case being treated in a symmetric 
way) is in a rectangle R on which a flip of tiling T can be done (R is defined by the end of gT(Vl)). 
Insert this rectangle in L, and update replacing T by Tyu p : for each vertex v of the interior of R, 
update gT(V), maxihTiv), hT, (v)) and the place of v in the "list of lists" of vertices. Notice that 
hT(v)- 4 < hTt,p (v) <_ hTiv), which permits to update the place of v in a constant time. Until : the 
"list of lists" is empty. The characteristic values of a vertex v can be deduced from those of its father 
in the spanning tree in 0(1) time units. Thus, the initialization can be done in O(A(P)) time units, 
where A(P) denotes the area (i. e. number of cells) of P. Each passage through the loop costs Oil ) time 
units (for m and n been fixed), and reduces the distance between the current tiling and T ~ from (rn 
- 1)(n -1). Thus the second part of the algorithm costs at most O ( A ( T, T') ) time units. 652 Thus 
the complete time cost is O(A(P) + A(T, T')), which is optimal since O(A(P)) time units are necessary 
to read the input and O(A(T,T')) time units are necessary to write the output. 4 Applications to tillngs 
in the triangular lattice From a similar method, similar results and algorithms can be obtained working 
in sets of prototiles of the triangular lattice we present the general framework below, but do not give 
technical details. 4.1 Le~n|ng dominoes and triangles The tri-angular lattice r induces three unit moves 
in the plane: rightwards, denoted by a, and b and c, such that angle(a, b) = angle(b, c) = angle(c, a) 
= 21I/3. We now study the set of prototiles S -{ldl,ld2,ld3,ld4,1ds,Ids,trl,tr2} (introduced in [5]), 
where Id~ (respectively tri) denotes a parallelogram (re- spectively an equilateral triangle) formed 
from four cells of r. Each prototile ld~ is called a leaning domino. A set of contour words of S is R 
= an O(A(P) + A(T, T')) algorithm, giving a sequence of flips, is obtained. Figure 2: Flips for leaning 
dominoes and triangles 4.2 Calissons The same method can easily be ap- plied to the set of prototiles 
S = {Call,cal2,cal3} (the calissous, introduced in [6]), each element of S being formed from two cells 
of r with a common edge. A set of contour words is { aba- l b -1, aca- l c -1, bcb- l c -1 }, thus the 
quotient Gt~,~e = GR, with R = {ab-l,ac -1 } can be used. Each element w of Gli~ has a canonical expression 
: there exists a unique relative integer such that w = a p . This permits to define the length l(w) of 
w by l(w) = Ipl. Given a tiling T of a polygon P, one can define a tiling projection gT from vertices 
of P to Gtine- One can prove that, for each vertex v of P, gT,(v)-lgT(V) is {a2ba-2b -1, a2ca-2c -1, 
b2ab-2a -1, b2cb-2c -1, c2ac-2a -1, element of the normal group N" ten of Gune generated c2bc-2b-l,aUb2c2,a2c2b2} 
and tiling functions map tilings to GR. Since GR is complex, we use quotients of it. The main quotient 
is Gtricolored ----- GR', with R' = {a 2, b 2, c2}. This group is isomorphic of the free product of three 
groups, each of them with only two elements. Each element w of etricolored has a canonical expres- p 
 sion : w can be written in a unique way as w = IIi=lXi with, for each integer i, xi E {a, b, c} and 
, for i < p, xi ¢ Xi+l. This permits to define the length l(w) of w by: l(w) = p. Given a tiling T of 
a polygon P, one can de-fine a tiling projection gT from vertices of P to Gtricolored. One can prove 
that, for each vertex v of P, gT,(V)-lgT(V) is element of the normal group Nc'eU of Gtr~colored generated 
by {abc, acb} (i. e. a set of contour words of cells). Afterwards, as in 3. 3, one proves that each element 
t w of N~e n can be written in a unique way as w = IIP_=ltj with, for each integer i, tj E {abc, acb, 
bac, bca, cab, cba} and, for j < p', tjti+l ¢ 1. This permits to define the decomposition number n(w) 
of w by n(w) = p', and, afterwards, the distance A(T, T') between two tilings of a same polygon P. We 
have to kind of local flips : they are presented in figure 2. Using the notion of extremal vertex of 
a pair (T, T') of tilings, remarking that for such a vertex vl, the canonical expressions of gT (Vl) 
and gT' (Vl)- 1 gT (U1) has the same suffix of length 2, one prove that the minimal number of flips from 
T to T' is A(T, T% Moreover, by {abc, acb} = {a3}. Thus, each element w of N"cen can be written in a 
unique way as w = a 3p' This permits to define the decomposition number n(w) of w by n(w) = Ip'l(= I(w)/3), 
and, afterwards, the distance A(T, T') between two tilings of a same polygon P. The local flips are induced 
by the two possible tilings or an hexagon formed from six cells of r (see figure 3). In this case, the 
end of the study is very simple, since Gune is isomorphic to Z. Figure 3: Flips for calissons This result 
about calissons can be obtained using elementary geometrical arguments, but here, we explain it with 
a general framework. References <RefA>[1] J. H. Conway, J. C. Lagarias, Tiling with Polyominoes and Combinatorial
