 A Compression Algorithm for DNA Sequences and Its Applications in Genome Comparison Xin Chen* Sam Kwong 
t Ming Li +* City University of Hong Kong City University of Hong Kong University of Waterloo We present 
a Iossless compression algorithm, Gen- Compress, for DNA sequences, based on searching for approximate 
repeats. Our algorithm achieves the best compression ratios for benchmark DNA sequences, com- paring 
to other DNA compression programs [3, 7]. Significantly better compression results show that the approximate 
repeats are one of the main hidden regu- larities in DNA sequences. We then describe a theory of measuring 
the relat- edness between two DNA sequences. We propose to use d(x, y) = 1-K(x)-K(xly) to measure the 
distance  K(*v) of any two sequences, where K stands for Kolmogorov complexity [5]. Here, K(x) -K(xly 
) is the mutual information shared by ~c and V. But mutual informa- tion is not a distance, there is 
no triangle inequality. The distance d(x, Y) is symmetric. It also satisfies the triangle inequality, 
and furthermore, it is universal [4]. It has not escaped our notice that the distance measure we have 
postulated can be immediately used to construct evolutionary trees from DNA sequences, especially those 
that cannot be aligned, such as com- plete genomes. With more and more genomes se- *Address: Department

2, 6, 8]. Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. We use GenCompress to approximate it. We present strong 
experimental support for this the- ory, and demonstrate its applicability by correctly con-structing 
a 16S (18S) rRNA tree, and a whole genome tree for several species of bacteria. Larger scale exper- iments 
are underway at the University of Waterloo, with very promising results. Remark. The full version of
