 772 A Appendix: Experimental Results We present some results of implementing 
the his­togram and convolution algorithms on a Connection Machine in this appendix. For details of the 
imple­mentation, see [9]. A.1 Histogram Algorithm Timing of histogram alg (in seconds) for 8-bit grey

0.086 64X 64 8 0.015 0.086 Table 1: Comparison of the histogram algorithms on the Connection Machine 
We implemented the single copy histogramming al­gorithm and the replicated data histogramming algo­rithm 
on the Connection Machine. Table 1 compares their performances. It may be noted that the best algorithm 
to compute histograms on the Connection Machine uses the capability of the machine to store the sum of 
the contending numbers in a concurrent write operation. Each PE writes a 1 to the node that holds the 
histogram value of its gray level value, with add as the combiner for the concurrent write operation. 
Though n2 PEs could attempt to write to the same location in the worst case, collision resolution done 
in hardware is fast. The comparison given in Table 1 is still relevant for a general hypercube architecture 
with no concurrent write capability. The virtual pro­cessor capability of the Connection Machine, in 
which each physical PE simulates multiple PEs, was used in the implement ation whenever the number of 
PEs re­quired was larger than what was physically available. The number of virtual PEs each physical 
PE is simu­lating is called the virtual processor ratio or VP ratio. The timings in the table have been 
adjusted taking VP ratio into account. A.2 Convolution Algorithm Timing of convolution (in seconds)

16K ~rocessin~ elements 32x~2 ] ix3 i.oo3 I 0.002 I 0.005 32x32 I 5x5 0.008 I 0.005 I 0.009 64X 64 3x3

the convolution algorithms on the Connection Machine Both convolution algorithms were implemented on 
the Connection Machine. Table 2 compares their per­formances. The third column of the table gives the 
time taken by the replicated data algorithm when the copies were shifted using the general router commu­nication 
instructions. The fourth column gives the timing of the replicated data algorithm when shifting was done 
using near-neighbor communications alone. In most cases, using near-neighbor communication is quicker 
on the Connection Machine. The last col­umn gives the timing of the single copy convolution algorithm. 
The VP ratio has been factored into the timings in the last column. The algorithms would be faster by 
the VP ratio factor, which]] is 128 for the last row, had the CM array been large enough. On the whole, 
the replicated data algorithm achieves im­ pressive speedup over the single copy version for image convolution 
operations.
