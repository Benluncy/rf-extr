0.086 64X 64 8 0.015 0.086 Table 1: Comparison of the histogram algorithms on the Connection Machine 
We implemented the single copy histogramming al­gorithm and the replicated data histogramming algo­rithm 
on the Connection Machine. Table 1 compares their performances. It may be noted that the best algorithm 
to compute histograms on the Connection Machine uses the capability of the machine to store the sum of 
the contending numbers in a concurrent write operation. Each PE writes a 1 to the node that holds the 
histogram value of its gray level value, with add as the combiner for the concurrent write operation. 
Though n2 PEs could attempt to write to the same location in the worst case, collision resolution done 
in hardware is fast. The comparison given in Table 1 is still relevant for a general hypercube architecture 
with no concurrent write capability. The virtual pro­cessor capability of the Connection Machine, in 
which each physical PE simulates multiple PEs, was used in the implement ation whenever the number of 
PEs re­quired was larger than what was physically available. The number of virtual PEs each physical 
PE is simu­lating is called the virtual processor ratio or VP ratio. The timings in the table have been 
adjusted taking VP ratio into account. A.2 Convolution Algorithm Timing of convolution (in seconds)

the convolution algorithms on the Connection Machine Both convolution algorithms were implemented on 
the Connection Machine. Table 2 compares their per­formances. The third column of the table gives the 
time taken by the replicated data algorithm when the copies were shifted using the general router commu­nication 
instructions. The fourth column gives the timing of the replicated data algorithm when shifting was done 
using near-neighbor communications alone. In most cases, using near-neighbor communication is quicker 
on the Connection Machine. The last col­umn gives the timing of the single copy convolution algorithm. 
The VP ratio has been factored into the timings in the last column. The algorithms would be faster by 
the VP ratio factor, which]] is 128 for the last row, had the CM array been large enough. On the whole, 
the replicated data algorithm achieves im­ pressive speedup over the single copy version for image convolution 
operations.

 APPENDIX  Function f for the completeness proof This appendix describes the construction of a 
function f on types that plays a role in the completeness proof, as ex­plained in the main body of the 
paper. In order to prove completeness, we consider a closed pro­cess P0, a name s, and a set of names 
S. We consider an instance of the general type system, and assume that this instance proves (by Theorem 
1) that P0 preserves the se­crecy of s from S. That is, we assume that, in this instance, there exists 
an environment E0 such that E0 f P0, E0 f s:T with T/. TPublic, and S = {a | E0 f a: T and T . TPublic}. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that E0 contains only names. We .x a proof of E0 f P0 for the 
rest of this argument. Intuitively, a well-chosen environment for a subprocess P of P0 is an environment 
that can be used to type P in a standard proof that P0 is well-typed, using the type sys­tem associated 
with the protocol checker in section 7.2. A standard proof is one in which types introduced by the rule 
(Restriction) for (.a)Q are of the form a[Tc1,...,Tcn], where Tc1,...,Tcn are the types of the variables 
bound by inputs above (.a)Q in P0 s syntax tree. A(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for P is simi­lar, 
except that the parameters (Tc1,...,Tcn) indicate which types should be chosen for the variables bound 
by inputs. Note that a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for P does not always exist, for example 
when the number of pa­rameters (Tc1,...,Tcn) does not correspond to the number of variables bound by 
inputs above P in P0. De.nition 2. Let Tc1,...,Tcn be closed patterns. A (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment 
for an occurrence of a subprocess of P0 is de.ned as follows: A ()-well-chosen environment for P0 is 
.0 .= {a . a[] | (a: T) . E0}. If Ec is a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for M(N).P, then Ec 
isa(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen envi­ronment for P.  If Ec is a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for 
M(x).P, then Ec[x..Tcn+1]isa(Tc1,...,Tcn,Tcn+1)­well-chosen environment for P.  If Ec isa(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen 
environment for P |Q, then Ec isa(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for P and Q.  If Ec is a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen 
environment for !P, then Ec isa(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for P.  If Ec is a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen 
environment for (.a)P, then Ec[a.c1,...,Tcnc1,...,Tcn)­  . a[T]] is a (T well-chosen environment for 
P. If Ec is a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for let x = g(M1,...,Mn) in P else Q, then Ec is 
a (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for Q, and if in addition there exists an equation g(M1' ,...,Mn' 
)= M ' in def(g) and a substitution s such that for all i . {1,...,n}, sMi ' = Ec(Mi), then Ec[x .. sM 
' ]isa (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen environment for P. Finally, the function f is de.ned so that if a type 
Tc ap­pears in a standard proof that P0 is well-typed using the type system associated with the protocol 
checker in section 7.2, then f(Tc) appears in the corresponding place in the proof of E0 f P0 in the 
instance of the general type system under consideration. De.nition 3. The partial function f: Tc . T 
from types of the protocol checker to types of the instance of the general type system is de.ned by induction 
on the term Tc: f(f(Tc1,...,Tcn)) = Of (f(Tc1),...,f(Tcn)). (There­fore, f(f(Tc1,...,Tcn)) is unde.ned 
if Of (f(Tc1),..., f(Tcn)) is unde.ned.)  If E0 f a: T, then f(a[]) = T.  When a is bound by a restriction 
in P0, we de.ne f(a[Tc1,...,Tcn]) as follows. Without loss of gener­ality, we may assume that a is bound 
exactly once. Let P be the process such that (.a)P is a subprocess of P0. Let Ec bea(Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen 
environment for (.a)P. Let E = f. Ec. Then f(a[Tc1,...,Tcn]) =  T ' where T ' is such that E,a: T ' 
f P is a judgment used to prove E0 f P0. There is at most one such judgment, so T ' is unique. Ifa (Tc1,...,Tcn)-well-chosen 
environment for (.a)P does not exist, or if no suitable judgment E,a: T ' f P appears in the proof of 
E0 f P0, then f(a[Tc1,...,Tcn]) is unde.ned. This de.nition is recursive, and we can check that it is 
well-founded using the following ordering. Names are or­dered by a<b if a is bound above b in P0,or a 
is free and b is bound in P0. The ordering on terms is then the lex­icographic ordering of pairs containing 
as .rst component the multiset of names that appear in the term and as sec­ond component the size of 
the term. In the .rst case of the de.nition of f, the .rst component is constant and the sec­ond one 
decreases. In the third case, the .rst component decreases: when de.ning f(a[Tc1,...,Tcn]), in the recur­sive 
calls used to compute f . Ec, the name a at the top of the term has disappeared, and the only names that 
have appeared due to the computation of the well-chosen envi­ronment are free names or names bound above 
a (therefore names smaller than a).

 Computer Graphics APPENDIX Curvature Derivation The curvature 
K of a parametric surface ~(u,v) = (X(u,v) Y(u,v) Z(u,v)) is (see APPROACH): lim 2N .AS K = -- As+o

2 Volume 15, Number 3 August 1981 To see how K varies wlth Au and Av, we divide by Av 2 and substitute 
t = Au/Av. Letting E = 12' G = vlSI2' F = S -S v, we have 'u'IS- U g(t) : (At 2 + 2Bt + C)/(Et 2 
+ 2Ft + G) Recasting this as an extremum problem with the implicit function H(g(t), t) = O, we see that 
 H(g(t), t) = (A -gE)t 2 + 2(B -gF)t + (C -gG) Conditions for an extremum are H(g(t), t) = O, and aH/at 
= O. The second of these yields t = (gF -B)/(A -gE), which, when substituted into the first, gives 
 g2(F2 -EG) + g(AG -2FB + EC) + B 2 -AC = 0 Under this condition then, we have extrema. In effect, we 
do not care what g looks like as long as we can find values which produce roots. Recalling that the sum 
and product of the roots of a quadratic are -b/a and c/a, we have from the above equation, AG -2FB +

 ISSN 0178­2789. A FORMULATION DETAILS In order to present a solution to equation 4 we .rst 
give the ex­ ''' plicit expressions for A(L,f(x, y)) and A ' (h, L ' ,f (x ,y )) re­spectively 2 2 
.f .f A(L,f(x, y))=1++dx dy (6) .x.y  and 2 2 .f'' ' ''' .f'' A (h, L ' ,f (x ,y ))=1+h2+h2dx dy 
.x'.y' (7) To evaluate the integral in equation 7, we perform a change of integration variables as 
follows x -1 x ' = T ' (8) yy By applying this change of variables to equation 7 (refer to equa­tion 
2 for a ' ,b ' ,d ' ), we obtain ' ''' A (h, L ' ,f (x ,y )) 2 ' . =1+ h2af .x 2 1/2 (9) .. 1 +h2b 
' +d ' fdx dy .x .ya 'd' '' ' =I(h,a ,b ,d ) dx dy  Now let us perform a series expansion of equation 
9 in the trans­formation parameters and the modulation factor. As far as the trans­formation parameters 
are concerned, we choose as expansion point the identity transformation and for the modulation factor 
we expand around h =1 ' ''' ' '' A (h, L ' ,f (x ,y ))=(I(h=1,a =1,b =0,d =1) .I ' .I ' +(a -1) + 
b .a' .b' .I ' .I +(d -1)+ (h - 1) .d ' .h + ... ) dx dy (10) In the following, we discard higher order 
terms in the expansion above. For small deformations around the identity transformation and h =1, a .rst 
order expansion represents a good approximation for the value of the surface area over a deformed triangle. 
Retaining terms up to .rst order in the series expansion and by plugging expression equation 10 into 
equation 4 we obtain A(L,f (x, y)) = C0 + C1(a ' -1) + C2b ' + C3(d ' -1) + C4(h-1) where C0 = I(1, 1, 
0, 1) dx dy .I C1 = dx dy .a' .I C2 = dx dy .b ' .I C3 = dx dy .d ' .I C4 = dx dy (11) .h We call these 
expansion coef.cients wrinkling coef.cients. C1,C2,C3,C4 relate changes in the parameters a ' ,b ' ,d 
' ,h to changes of the area of the wrinkle function on the triangle. By observing that C0 = A(L,f(x, 
y)) and solving equation 11 for the modulation factor we obtain 1 ' '' h =1- (C1(a -1) + C2b + C3(d -1)) 
(12) C4 Equation 12 represents the solution to equation 4 in the .rst or­ ''' ''' der approximation 
to A ' (h, L ' ,f (x ,y )), if f (x ,y ) is not con­stant.
